Rendkívül alacsony a valószínűsége: Az Univerzumban számos galaxis és csillag található, de még mindig nincs megbízható bizonyíték arra, hogy más bolygókon vagy égitesteken élet létezne. Az élet kialakulása és fejlődése komplex folyamatokhoz kötött, amelyeknek kis valószínűsége lehet. 2. Ritka feltételek: Az emberek által ismert életformákhoz számos speciális feltételre van szükség, beleértve a megfelelő hőmérsékletet, víz jelenlétét és egyéb környezeti tényezőket. Ezek a feltételek nagyon ritkák lehetnek az Univerzumban, ezért van kevés esély arra, hogy más bolygókon ugyanilyen feltételekkel találkozzunk. 3. Közvetlen bizonyíték hiánya: Habár a Csillagok háborúja és az UFO-látogatások ötletei nagyon népszerűek a kultúrában és a média világában, jelenleg nincs meggyőző bizonyíték arra, hogy a földönkívüliek valóban léteznek, és hogy már meglátogatták volna a Földet. Az UFO-észlelések jelentős része misztikus vagy megmagyarázatlan okokra vezethető vissza. 4. A Fermi-paradoxon: A híres fizikus, Enrico Fermi, arra a következtetésre jutott, hogy ha a földönkívüliek léteznek, és technikailag fejlettebbek nálunk, akkor már régóta kapcsolatba kellett volna lépniük velünk. Azonban nem tapasztaltunk még semmilyen bizonyítékot arra, hogy más civilizációkkal találkoztunk volna. 5. Hiányzó bizonyíték: Eddig a NASA és más űrkutatási intézmények nem találtak semmilyen megalapozott bizonyítékot a földönkívüli életre. Bár találtak mikrobiális életformákat az űrben található meteorokon, ezek megfelelő körülmények között keletkezhettek a Földön is. Azonban fontos megjegyezni, hogy ezek az érvek csak jelenlegi tudásunk és technológiánk alapján érvényesek, és a jövőben új felfedezések és információk lehetnek, amelyek megváltoztathatják ezeket az álláspontokat."},{"instruction":"Mondj a NASAhoz hasonló más űrkutatási intézményeket amelyek a földönkívüli élet kutatásával foglalkoznak!","output":"Az alábbiakban néhány űrkutatási intézményt sorolok fel, amelyek foglalkoznak vagy foglalkoztak a földönkívüli élet kutatásával: 1. European Space Agency (ESA): Az Európai Űrügynökség számos missziót indított az űrben az élet kutatására. Például az ExoMars misszió azokat a feltételeket vizsgálja, amelyek lehetővé tehetik az élet kialakulását a Mars felszínén. 2. Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI): Az STScI többek között támogatja a Hubble Űrteleszkóp működését. A Hubble jelentős eredményeket ért el azzal, hogy megfigyeléseket végzett más bolygórendszerekben és Galaxisokban, amelyek hozzájárulhatnak a földönkívüli élet kutatásához. 3. SETI Intézet (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence): A SETI Intézet egy non-profit szervezet, amely a rádiójeleket vizsgálja, remélve, hogy valamilyen földönkívüli intelligens civilizáció jeleit észleli. Az intézet a földönkívüli intelligencia keresése terén végzett kutatásokkal foglalkozik. 4. Mars Science Laboratory (MSL): Az MSL projekt része a NASA Mars-kutatási programjának, melynek célja a Mars-t felszíni jeleinek kutatása, beleértve azokat is, amelyek a fosszilis élet nyomait vagy jelenlétét jelezhetik. 5. Astrobiológiai Intézetek: Több országban találhatók olyan intézmények, amelyek az astrobiológia területén kutatnak, vagyis vizsgálják az élet kialakulását és fennmaradását más bolygókon. Ilyen intézmények például az Ames Kutatóközpont (NASA), a RAS A. N. Neszmithov Intézet (Oroszország), az Australian Centre for Astrobiology (Ausztrália) és a Centro de Astrobiología (Spanyolország). Ez csak néhány példa azokra a kutatóintézetekre, amelyek a földönkívüli élet kutatásával foglalkoznak. Fontos megjegyezni, hogy számos űrkutató intézmény vesz részt a Mars-kutatásban és az exobolygók felfedezésében is, amelyek mind hozzájárulhatnak a földönkívüli élet megértéséhez."},{"instruction":"Kik voltak a legnagyobb keresztény tudósok és feltalálók?","output":"A keresztény vallásnak számos nagy tudós és feltaláló volt a történelem során.

Selon les dernières données de l'Organisation mondiale de la santé (OMS), la RDC est classée parmi les pays à haut taux d'incidence de la tuberculose, avec environ 374 000 nouveaux cas diagnostiqués chaque année. Malheureusement, la prévention, le diagnostic précoce et le traitement efficace de cette maladie restent des défis majeurs en RDC. Dans le contexte actuel de l'expansion rapide du domaine de l'intelligence artificielle et du machine learning, de nouvelles possibilités se dessinent pour améliorer les méthodes de prédiction de la tuberculose. Ces approches basées sur le machine learning offrent la possibilité de développer des modèles de prédiction plus précis et plus rapides en utilisant des algorithmes sophistiqués capables d'apprendre à partir de données historiques. L'objectif principal de cette thèse est donc de développer une approche basée sur le machine learning pour la prédiction de la tuberculose en RDC. Plus précisément, nous cherchons à identifier les principaux facteurs de risque de la tuberculose dans ce pays et à construire un modèle de prédiction précis basé sur ces facteurs. Ce modèle permettra d'anticiper les cas de tuberculose avec une meilleure précision, d'orienter les interventions de santé publique et de mieux allouer les ressources disponibles. Pour atteindre ces objectifs, nous utiliserons une méthodologie de recherche rigoureuse qui comprendra la collecte de données sur les cas de tuberculose diagnostiqués en RDC, le nettoyage et la préparation de ces données, la sélection des variables pertinentes, la construction et l'évaluation du modèle de prédiction. L'approche basée sur le machine learning nous permettra de tirer parti des avancées technologiques récentes pour obtenir des résultats plus précis et fiables. Cette recherche vise à apporter une contribution significative à la lutte contre la tuberculose en RDC en améliorant les méthodes de prédiction disponibles. En identifiant les facteurs de risque clés et en construisant un modèle de prédiction précis, cette approche basée sur le machine learning permettra d'identifier les groupes à risque élevé, de guider les programmes de prévention et d'améliorer la santé globale de la population. Le reste de cette thèse est organisé de la manière suivante: le chapitre 2 donne une revue de la littérature sur les approches existantes de prédiction de la tuberculose en utilisant le machine learning, le chapitre 3 présente la méthodologie utilisée pour collecter et préparer les données, le chapitre 4 détaille la construction et l'évaluation du modèle de prédiction, le chapitre 5 discute les résultats obtenus et les limites de l'étude, enfin le chapitre 6 conclut cette thèse en résumant les principales conclusions et propose des pistes de recherches futures."},{"instruction":"[told from Sayori's point of view, there would be dialogue in this story:] (This is the Ethereal Workshop. Now, the rest of the club members were born in the *human* world. But as for me...I was actually born in the Ethereal Workshop; which serves as the brain of the Colossal Zarroë, A.K.A. Ethereal Island. But before I explain how I can go from the human world to the Ethereal Workshop, let me tell you how I first came into the world of Ethereal Workshop - starting from when my parents, which are actually humans, moved into the Ethereal Workshop before I was even born.)","output":"I remember it like it was yesterday. My parents, middle-aged and full of wonder, made the decision to move into the Ethereal Workshop, a realm unknown to most humans. They were fascinated by the stories they had heard of this mystical place, where creativity and imagination flowed like a river. In that moment, as a tiny seed of life inside my mother's womb, I didn't realize the profound impact this decision would have on my life. It was as if destiny had chosen me to bridge the gap between the human world and the Ethereal Workshop. As the days turned into months, my parents settled into their new home within the vibrant, swirling colors of the Ethereal Workshop. They embraced the magical energy that surrounded them, eagerly exploring every nook and cranny of this ethereal realm. And then, on a clear summer evening, the moment arrived. As the warm breeze kissed my mother's cheeks, I entered into this world. I was born amidst the splendor of the Ethereal Workshop, surrounded by the loving embrace of my parents and the mystical aura that hung in the air. Growing up in the Ethereal Workshop was a whimsical adventure. I would spend my days exploring the enchanting landscapes, where mountains seemed to rise and dissolve like cotton candy, and trees sparkled with the essence of dreams. It was a place where imagination had no limits, and I was free to let my mind soar. But as I grew older, I started feeling a tug towards the human world. It was a curiosity that gnawed at me, wanting to explore the other side of my existence. It was then that I discovered a mystical portal hidden deep within the heart of the Ethereal Workshop - a stairway that led to a secret door, connecting the two worlds. One day, fueled by both excitement and trepidation, I mustered the courage to step through that door. It was like walking into a sepia-toned version of reality, where everything seemed muted compared to the vibrant colors of the Ethereal Workshop. I would find myself at a small primary school, surrounded by children who had never experienced the wonders of the Ethereal Workshop. It was a strange and fascinating experience, trying to balance my life in both worlds. As time passed and I joined the Literature Club, the contrast between the lively, captivating Ethereal Workshop and the mundane humdrum of the human world became more apparent. However, every time I returned to the Ethereal Workshop, I felt a sense of belonging and purpose that couldn't be found anywhere else. So here I am, standing in the clubroom, surrounded by my dear friends. They may have been born in the human world, but my origins lie in the ethereal realm. And together, we navigate the trials and tribulations of life, bridging the gap between two worlds, all while cherishing the bonds we've formed as members of the Literature Club."},{"instruction":"(However, everything changed when Yuri got pregnant.

Leaving the mystical world of Meebs behind, I hurriedly made my way to the literature club meeting. I could feel the weight of worry and anticipation weighing on my heart as I approached the clubroom door. Opening it gently, I stepped inside to find Yuri sitting at the desk, her face marked with a mix of excitement and apprehension.

I never thought this would happen, you know?\\" I nodded, understanding the conflicting emotions that come with such news. \\"It's perfectly normal to feel that way, Yuri. Pregnancy is a beautiful journey, but it can also be overwhelming.\\" Natsuki, who had been quiet until now, spoke up. \\"Yeah, well, I hope she knows what she's doing. We can't just ignore the fact that this changes everything for the club.\\" I could sense the tension in the air as Natsuki's words hung, heavy with concern. I took a deep breath, trying to diffuse the situation with a touch of optimism. \\"I know it's a big change, Natsuki, but we've faced challenges together before. We can support Yuri and find a way to make it work.\\" \\"Support?\\" Monika interjected, her voice laced with uncertainty. \\"How do we even begin to support Yuri? We don't know the first thing about raising a child. This is uncharted territory!\\" I glanced at Yuri, catching her gaze, and then turned my attention to the rest of the club. \\"We may not have the answers right now, but what we can do is be there for Yuri. We can provide her with love, understanding, and a safe space to share her thoughts and concerns. Together, we can navigate this journey and help her feel supported.\\" The club fell momentarily silent as my words sank in. Yuri's expression softened, a glimmer of hope shining amidst her worries. Slowly, Natsuki's hardened resolve softened as well, and Monika seemed to have a newfound determination. \\"I guess you're right, Sayori,\\" Natsuki mumbled, her voice a bit more subdued. \\"We can't just abandon Yuri. We're her friends.\\" With a small smile, I took a step forward, reaching out to place a comforting hand on Yuri's shoulder. \\"We're all in this together, Yuri. Your happiness and well-being are important to us. We'll figure it out, step by step.\\" Yuri smiled back, her eyes shimmering with gratitude. The weight of uncertainty may still loom over us, but as we stood there in the literature club, surrounded by friendship and understanding, I knew that we had the strength and love to face whatever challenges lay ahead."},{"instruction":"(Yuri's pregnancy went smoothly, and we were there for her throughout the entire thing.

And now, the opportunity had finally presented itself. With excitement and anticipation, I guided my friends through the ethereal landscapes, pointing out the wonders and enchantments that surrounded us. As we ventured deeper into the heart of the workshop, their eyes widened with awe and wonder. The vibrant colors, the ethereal creatures, and the sheer creativity that permeated the air left them breathless. It was a moment of pure joy for me, seeing my friends experience the magic that had shaped my life. However, as our tour continued, a sudden tightening in my chest brought my joy to a halt. I turned to face Yuri, who had been silently walking beside me, her hands gently cradling her growing belly. The expression on her face shifted from wonder to discomfort as she winced, her breath catching. \\"Yuri, are you okay?\\" I asked, worry lacing my voice as I hurriedly stepped closer to her. With a strained smile, she tried to reassure me. \\"Don't worry, Sayori. It's just...contractions. They've started.\\" The air around us seemed to lose its ethereal glow, as the weight of the situation settled upon us. The excitement of the Ethereal Workshop quickly gave way to concern for our dear friend and her unborn child. \\"We need to get you to a safe place, Yuri,\\" Monika declared, her voice tinged with urgency. Without a moment's hesitation, we guided Yuri out of the Ethereal Workshop, steering her towards a place where she could receive the care she needed. Our once leisurely tour became a swift journey, fueled by the determination to ensure Yuri's well-being. As we arrived at a nearby hospital, the reality of the situation hit us. Yuri, now in the capable hands of medical professionals, was preparing to bring new life into the world. The rest of us lingered in the waiting room, nervously fidgeting as time passed slowly. Hours turned into minutes, minutes into seconds, and finally, the long-awaited cry of a baby filled the air. Yuri had given birth, and a new chapter had begun. With cautious smiles and trembling excitement, we were invited into the room. Yuri looked exhausted but radiant, cradling her newborn child in her arms. Pure joy radiated from her as she introduced us to her precious bundle of joy. Tears welled up in my eyes as I beheld the sight before me. Our tour of the Ethereal Workshop had been interrupted, yet in that very moment, it felt like the conclusion of a grand adventure. The magic and wonder that held me captive in the ethereal realm seemed to pale in comparison to the miracle of new life in Yuri's arms. In that room, amidst the love and elation, we found ourselves united in the realization that life's most magical moments are not confined to an ethereal realm or the pages of a story. They exist right here, right now, in the bonds we share and the joy we experience together. And as we celebrated the arrival of Yuri's child, we knew deep in our hearts that the Ethereal Workshop would always be a part of us, woven into the fabric of our friendship. But in this moment, we found solace in the reality unfolding before us, relishing in the enchantment of new life and the strength born from our profound connection."},{"instruction":"propose moi un questionnaire avec des question variées (choix multiples , case a cocher etc...) sur l' audit financier et comptable","output":"Voici un questionnaire sur l'audit financier et comptable avec des questions variées : 1.

Terrestrial ecosystems are found on land and include forests, grasslands, deserts, tundra, and more. These ecosystems are characterized by a variety of plant and animal species that have adapted to the specific conditions of the environment. Terrestrial ecosystems provide habitats for a wide range of organisms and support important ecological processes such as nutrient cycling, pollination, and carbon storage. Aquatic ecosystems, on the other hand, are found in bodies of water such as lakes, rivers, oceans, and wetlands. These ecosystems vary greatly depending on the water's temperature, salinity, depth, and nutrient levels. Aquatic ecosystems support unique plant and animal species, including fish, crustaceans, plankton, and water plants. They play a crucial role in maintaining water quality, regulating climate, and providing habitat for numerous organisms. Both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems are interconnected and depend on each other for survival. They are also impacted by human activities such as deforestation, pollution, overfishing, and climate change. Conserving and protecting these ecosystems is essential for maintaining biodiversity and ensuring the long-term survival of both human and non-human life."},{"instruction":"(In the clubroom…) Monika: “Wait a minute…where’s Natsuki?” Sayori: “I have no clue.” Yuri: “No idea.

In a reverse repo, the central bank sells a security, often a Treasury bond, to the commercial bank with an agreement to buy it back at a later date, usually within a few days or weeks. The purpose of a reverse repo is to temporarily withdraw liquidity from the financial system. When the central bank sells the security, it receives cash from the commercial bank, which reduces the amount of money available for lending or investing in the market. This helps regulate and control the money supply in the economy. Reverse repos are often used as a tool of monetary policy by central banks to manage short-term interest rates and influence the overall level of liquidity in the market. By conducting reverse repos, central banks can either tighten or loosen the money supply, depending on their monetary policy goals. In simpler terms, a reverse repo is when a central bank sells a security to a commercial bank or other financial institution to temporarily take money out of the system. This is done to control the amount of money available for lending and investing, and is used as a tool to influence interest rates and manage the economy."},{"instruction":"what is a repo","output":"A repurchase agreement, or repo for short, is a financial transaction in which one party sells a security, typically a Treasury bond or other government security, to another party with an agreement to repurchase it at a later date, usually within a few days or weeks. In a repo, the party selling the security, known as the \\"seller\\" or \\"borrower\\", receives cash from the party buying the security, known as the \\"buyer\\" or \\"lender\\". The cash received by the seller is usually less than the full value of the security, with the difference representing the interest or fee for borrowing the cash. Repos are often used as a short-term borrowing mechanism by banks, financial institutions, and even central banks. The seller of the security gives cash to the buyer, who holds the security as collateral. At the agreed-upon date, the seller repurchases the security, paying back the cash plus the agreed-upon interest or fee. Repos serve several purposes, including providing liquidity in the financial system, allowing banks and financial institutions to meet short-term funding needs, and enabling the central bank to conduct monetary policy operations. They are considered low-risk transactions because the security serves as collateral, and if the borrower defaults on repurchasing the security, the lender can sell the security to recover its money. In simpler terms, a repo is when one party sells a security to another party with an agreement to buy it back later. It is a way for banks and financial institutions to obtain short-term funding, using the security as collateral. Repurchase agreements are widely used in financial markets to manage liquidity and support various financial transactions."},{"instruction":"Temporary Open Market Operations","output":"Temporary open market operations (TOMOs) refer to short-term transactions conducted by a central bank in the open market to adjust liquidity levels in the banking system. These operations are temporary in nature and aim to address short-term liquidity imbalances or implement monetary policy decisions. During a temporary open market operation, the central bank buys or sells securities, typically government bonds, from or to financial institutions such as commercial banks. The objective is to inject or withdraw funds from the banking system to manage interest rates and stabilize the money supply. When the central bank conducts a temporary open market purchase, it purchases securities from financial institutions and pays them in cash. This injects money into the banking system, making more cash available for lending or investment, which can lower short-term interest rates. On the other hand, when the central bank conducts a temporary open market sale, it sells securities to financial institutions, reducing the amount of cash in the banking system. This withdrawal of liquidity can increase short-term interest rates, discouraging excessive borrowing and spending. TOMOs are typically conducted for short durations, ranging from a few days to a few weeks. They are often used as a tool of monetary policy to manage day-to-day fluctuations in liquidity and interest rates to achieve the central bank's macroeconomic objectives. In summary, temporary open market operations are short-term transactions conducted by a central bank to inject or withdraw liquidity from the banking system. These operations aim to manage interest rates, stabilize the money supply, and implement monetary policy decisions."},{"instruction":"Is \\" Overnight Reverse Repurchase Agreements: Treasury Securities Sold by the Federal Reserve in the Temporary Open Market Operations (RRPONTSYD)\\" the only way the Fed can affect the interest rate?","output":"No, overnight reverse repurchase agreements (ON RRP) are not the only tool the Federal Reserve (the Fed) uses to affect interest rates. The Fed has several tools at its disposal to influence interest rates and implement monetary policy. Some of the key tools are: 1. Open Market Operations (OMO): This includes both permanent and temporary open market operations. Permanent open market operations involve the buying and selling of Treasury securities to permanently adjust the money supply. Temporary open market operations, as mentioned earlier, include both repos and reverse repos, which are used to adjust short-term liquidity levels. 2. Interest Rate Policy: The most well-known tool is the Fed's ability to set the target range for the federal funds rate, which is the interest rate at which banks lend reserves to each other overnight. By adjusting this target rate, the Fed influences short-term interest rates throughout the banking system. 3. Reserve Requirements: Banks are required to maintain a certain level of reserves with the central bank. By adjusting these reserve requirements, the Fed can impact the amount of money that banks have available for lending. 4. Discount Window: The Fed acts as a lender of last resort to banks. Banks can borrow from the Federal Reserve's discount window in times of need, and the interest rate charged on these loans can affect short-term rates. 5. Forward Guidance: The Fed provides guidance about its future plans for monetary policy, which can affect market expectations and influence interest rates. 6. Quantitative Easing (QE): In extraordinary circumstances, the Fed may engage in large-scale asset purchases, such as government bonds or mortgage-backed securities, to provide additional liquidity to the financial system and lower long-term interest rates. These tools provide the Federal Reserve with various mechanisms to influence interest rates and manage the economy in line with its mandated goals of price stability and maximum employment. The Fed selects the appropriate tool or combination of tools based on prevailing economic conditions and its policy objectives."},{"instruction":"Describe these 6 things with fitting analogies like (piggy bank) or (currency printing).","output":"1. Open Market Operations: This is like a car's accelerator and brake pedals. Just as you press the accelerator to inject more fuel and increase speed, the Fed can buy government securities to inject money into the economy and stimulate growth. Conversely, just as you hit the brakes to slow down the car, the Fed can sell securities to withdraw money from the economy and curb inflationary pressures. 2. Interest Rate Policy: Think of this as a thermostat in your home. When the temperature rises above the desired level, the thermostat kicks in and activates the air conditioning to cool the room. Similarly, when the economy heats up and inflation rises, the Fed raises interest rates to cool down borrowing and spending. 3. Reserve Requirements: Imagine a bathtub with a drain. Reserve requirements are like adjusting the size of the drain plug. If the Fed wants banks to have more money available for lending, it can make the drain plug smaller, allowing banks to retain less in reserves. Conversely, if the Fed wants to restrict lending, it can make the drain plug larger, forcing banks to hold onto more reserves. 4. Discount Window: Think of the discount window as an emergency cash loan from a friend. When you urgently need money, you can turn to your friend to borrow at an agreed-upon interest rate. Similarly, banks can turn to the discount window as a last resort for short-term funds when they are facing liquidity challenges. 5. Forward Guidance: Imagine a weather forecaster predicting tomorrow's weather. The Fed's forward guidance is like the forecast that helps individuals and businesses plan accordingly. If the forecast suggests a storm is coming (e.g., economic downturn), people may decide to save more and spend less. Conversely, if the forecast predicts sunny skies (e.g., economic recovery), people may be more willing to borrow and invest. 6. Quantitative Easing (QE): Picture a chef adding extra spices to a dish. Just as the chef adds more spices to enhance the flavor, the Fed can engage in QE by buying large quantities of government bonds or mortgage-backed securities. This infusion of money into the economy is like adding extra spice to stimulate economic activity and drive down long-term interest rates. These analogies provide a simplified representation of the various tools used by the Federal Reserve to influence the economy and interest rates."},{"instruction":"(In the clubroom…) Monika: “Wait a minute…where’s Natsuki?” Sayori: “I have no clue.” Yuri: “No idea.

The End."},{"instruction":"доклад на тему гендерные стереотипы и предрассудки","output":"Гендерные стереотипы и предрассудки являются распространенными и сложными проблемами, которые влияют на все аспекты нашей жизни. Они затрагивают отношения между людьми, роли в обществе, возможности и ожидания, которые мы возлагаем на мужчин и женщин. Первым шагом к пониманию гендерных стереотипов и предрассудков является определение этих терминов. Гендерные стереотипы - это общепринятые идеи о том, какими должны быть мужчины и женщины, основанные на их поле. Например, стереотипом может быть, что мужчины должны быть сильными, а женщины – нежными и эмоциональными. Предрассудки же представляют собой предвзятые или негативные мнения о ком-то на основе их гендера. Эти стереотипы и предрассудки приводят к неравенству между мужчинами и женщинами в обществе. Например, женщины часто сталкиваются с дискриминацией на рабочем месте, получая меньше зарплаты, чем мужчины за аналогичную работу. Это связано с представлением, что женщины меньше подходят для определенных профессий или менее эффективны в них. Гендерные стереотипы и предрассудки также ограничивают возможности для мужчин. Например, мужчины, которые проявляют интерес к роли родителя и желанию оставаться дома с детьми, могут столкнуться с осуждением со стороны общества, так как считается, что \\"настоящий мужчина\\" должен быть финансовым опорой семьи. Эти стереотипы и предрассудки также влияют на роли, которые мы ожидаем от мужчин и женщин в отношениях. Например, ожидается, что женщины будут ухаживать и заботиться о мужчинах, в то время как мужчины должны быть сильными и независимыми. Это создает давление на оба пола и негативно влияет на их отношения. Однако, мы можем бороться с гендерными стереотипами и предрассудками. Все начинается с осознания их существования и усилий для изменения своего мышления и поведения. Мы должны быть открытыми и толерантными по отношению к различным ролям и идеям о том, что может и должно делать каждый пол. Мы должны поддерживать равные возможности и справедливое обращение между всеми людьми, независимо от их пола. Гендерные стереотипы и предрассудки несут большое количество проблем, и их преодоление требует усилий со стороны всех нас. Мы должны работать вместе, чтобы создать инклюзивное общество, где каждый имеет равные возможности для реализации своего потенциала, независимо от их гендера."},{"instruction":"примеры гендерных стереотипов","output":"Вот несколько примеров гендерных стереотипов: 1. Мужчины должны быть сильными и безразличными к эмоциям. 2. Женщины должны быть нежными, заботливыми и эмоциональными. 3. Мужчины лучше всего подходят для технических и физических профессий, в то время как женщины лучше всего подходят для заботы о доме и детях. 4. Мужчины должны быть главами семей и зарабатывать больше денег, а женщины должны быть второстепенными и подчиняться мужчинам. 5. Мужчины должны активно участвовать в политике и деловой сфере, в то время как женщины должны оставаться дома и заниматься домашними делами. 6. Мужчины не должны показывать свои слабости или просить о помощи. 7. Женщины должны всегда выглядеть привлекательными и следить за своей внешностью. Это лишь некоторые из множества гендерных стереотипов, которые существуют в обществе. Важно понимать, что эти стереотипы вредны и ограничивают свободу и возможности для людей, независимо от их пола."},{"instruction":"ответь на вопрос что такое гендерные предрассудки и приведи примеры","output":"Гендерные предрассудки - это предвзятые и негативные установки, мнения или суждения о людях на основе их пола или гендера. Это представления, которые могут быть неверными, оскорбительными или дискриминационными. Гендерные предрассудки часто формируются на основе стереотипов о мужчинах и женщинах и могут влиять на взаимоотношения, возможности и уровень уважения в обществе. Вот некоторые примеры гендерных предрассудков: 1. Представление о том, что женщины неподходящи для руководящих должностей или политики, так как они считаются эмоциональными и менее способными принимать важные решения. 2. Верование в то, что мужчины не могут быть заботливыми родителями или нянями для детей, так как роль домашней заботы обычно связывается с женщинами. 3. Предубеждение против мужчин, выбравших профессии, которые традиционно считаются \\"женскими\\", такими как медсестры или учителя детского сада, так как это противоречит стереотипу \\"настоящего мужчины\\". 4. Стереотип о том, что женщины неприспособлены для технических и научных профессий, так как недостаточно умны или технически подготовлены. 5. Предрассудки против гендерных менеджеров или руководителей, так как мужчины считаются более авторитарными и способными к руководству. Гендерные предрассудки могут иметь серьезные последствия, такие как неравное вознаграждение, ограничение возможностей развития карьеры и дискриминация на рабочем месте. Они также могут приводить к распространению сексизма и нарушению прав человека. Поэтому важно бороться с гендерными предрассудками и поощрять равенство и справедливое отношение ко всем людям, независимо от их пола или гендера."},{"instruction":"Describe the main tools of the Federal Reserve with fitting analogies like (piggy bank) or (currency printing).","output":"The main tools of the Federal Reserve are often referred to as monetary policy tools, and here are some fitting analogies for each: 1. Open Market Operations: This tool is like a tug of war rope. The Federal Reserve buys or sells government securities (bonds) in the open market to increase or decrease the amount of money in circulation. Buying bonds pulls money into the economy, just like pulling on a rope brings the opposing team closer. Conversely, selling bonds removes money from circulation, just like pulling the rope away from the opposing team. 2. Reserve Requirements: Reserve requirements are like a fence around a yard. The Federal Reserve determines the percentage of deposits that banks must hold in reserve, which acts as a barrier to control the amount of money available for lending. Increasing reserve requirements is akin to raising the height of the fence, limiting the amount banks can lend. Lowering reserve requirements lowers the fence, allowing banks to lend more freely. 3. Discount Rate: The discount rate is like a borrowing cost menu. It represents the interest rate commercial banks must pay if they borrow directly from the Federal Reserve. It acts as a benchmark for other interest rates in the economy. Increasing the discount rate is similar to raising the prices on the menu, making it more expensive for banks to borrow from the Federal Reserve. Lowering the discount rate decreases borrowing costs, like offering discounts on the menu. 4. Forward Guidance: Forward guidance is like a compass in the dark. It involves the Federal Reserve providing clear indications and guidance on future monetary policy decisions to shape market expectations. It helps guide businesses, consumers, and financial institutions in making decisions and planning ahead, just as a compass illuminates the right direction when visibility is limited. 5. Quantitative Easing: Quantitative easing is like watering a plant with a sprinkler. It involves the Federal Reserve purchasing long-term government bonds and other securities from the broader market to inject money into the economy. This infusion of funds helps promote liquidity, lower interest rates, and encourage borrowing and spending, similar to how watering a plant helps it grow and flourish. These analogies help illustrate the way each tool functions and the impact it has on the economy in a more relatable manner."},{"instruction":"Which one results in an increase in the amount of USD in existence?","output":"The tool that results in an increase in the amount of USD in existence is Open Market Operations. When the Federal Reserve buys government securities (bonds) in the open market, it increases the money supply. It does so by creating new money (USD) and using it to purchase these securities, thereby injecting more currency into circulation. This tool expands the monetary base and increases the overall supply of USD available in the economy."},{"instruction":"Does QE increase the amount of USD in existence?","output":"Yes, Quantitative Easing (QE) does increase the amount of USD in existence. During QE, the Federal Reserve purchases long-term government bonds and other securities from the broader market. To pay for these securities, the Federal Reserve creates new money, effectively expanding the money supply. This injection of new money into the economy increases the amount of USD in circulation, resulting in an expansion of the overall money supply. Therefore, QE is a tool that directly leads to an increase in the amount of USD in existence."},{"instruction":"Which other tools increase USD supply?","output":"In addition to Open Market Operations (OMO) and Quantitative Easing (QE), there are a couple of other tools that can increase the supply of USD: 1. Decreasing Reserve Requirements: When the Federal Reserve lowers the reserve requirements, it allows banks to hold a smaller percentage of deposits as reserves and increases the amount of money available for lending. This expansion of lending can lead to an increase in the supply of USD as more funds are circulated in the economy. 2. Decreasing the Discount Rate: Lowering the discount rate reduces the cost for banks to borrow directly from the Federal Reserve. When banks have easier access to cheaper funds, they are more likely to borrow, lend to businesses and consumers, and increase the overall supply of USD in circulation. It's important to note that these tools are all used by the Federal Reserve as part of its monetary policy to influence the money supply and manage economic conditions. The Federal Reserve can adjust these tools based on its goals and the prevailing economic conditions to either increase or decrease the supply of USD in the economy."},{"instruction":"Which tools create new USD out of thin air (versus just increasing circulation).","output":"The two main tools that create new USD out of thin air are: 1. Open Market Operations (OMO): When the Federal Reserve conducts OMO, it purchases government securities (bonds) from the open market. In this process, the Federal Reserve creates new money (USD) electronically and uses it to buy the securities. This injection of new money into the system effectively increases the overall supply of USD in existence. 2. Quantitative Easing (QE): QE is an expansionary monetary policy tool where the Federal Reserve purchases long-term government bonds and other securities from the open market. To finance these purchases, the Federal Reserve creates new money electronically, thereby increasing the supply of USD. Unlike OMO, QE specifically focuses on long-term securities and aims to provide additional monetary stimulus during periods of economic downturns or when interest rates are already low. Both of these tools involve creating new USD electronically, essentially \\"out of thin air,\\" rather than relying solely on the circulation of existing currency."},{"instruction":"Hola, tengo 16 años y recientemente hace 2 o 3 días la parte superior de mi ojo derecho se ha empezado a inchar y actualmente lo tngo bastante inchado y con dolor al tacto. Que puede ser?","output":"No soy médico, pero hay varias posibles causas para la hinchazón y dolor en la parte superior del ojo derecho. Aquí te mencionaré algunas posibilidades: 1. Picadura o alergia: Podrías haber sido picado por algún insecto o haber tenido una reacción alérgica a algo que has tocado o expuesto cerca de tu ojo. 2. Infección: Existe la posibilidad de que hayas desarrollado una infección en el área afectada, como una infección del párpado o del conducto lagrimal. Si es así, probablemente notarás enrojecimiento y posible secreción. 3. Sinusitis: Si has tenido síntomas de congestión nasal o dolor de cabeza en combinación con la hinchazón en el ojo, es posible que estés experimentando una sinusitis, que es una inflamación de los senos paranasales. Ante tu situación, te recomendaría que consultes a un médico o a un oftalmólogo. Ellos podrán realizar un examen completo y determinar la causa exacta de la hinchazón y el dolor en tu ojo derecho.

Ya que me quedo despierto muchas horas en la noche y usandolo","output":"El uso excesivo del teléfono móvil o de cualquier dispositivo electrónico puede tener efectos en la salud de los ojos, pero generalmente no se asocia directamente con la hinchazón y el dolor ocular. El uso prolongado de dispositivos electrónicos puede causar fatiga ocular, sequedad, irritación y molestias, pero no suele provocar inflamación significativa. Sin embargo, es importante destacar que pasar muchas horas despierto por la noche utilizando el teléfono, especialmente en condiciones de poca luz o en una postura incómoda, puede aumentar el riesgo de padecer síntomas de fatiga ocular y puede contribuir indirectamente a la aparición de problemas oculares.

Le pays connaît l'un des taux les plus élevés de tuberculose en Afrique subsaharienne. La maladie est largement répandue et touche toutes les provinces de la RDC, avec une prévalence élevée chez les adultes et les enfants. Plusieurs facteurs contribuent à la propagation de la tuberculose en RDC. La pauvreté, le manque d'accès aux soins de santé de qualité, la surpopulation, les conditions de vie précaires, le VIH/SIDA et la malnutrition sont autant de facteurs de risque importants. De plus, le système de santé dans le pays est souvent défaillant, ce qui entraîne des retards dans le diagnostic et le traitement de la maladie. Le traitement de la tuberculose en RDC est également un défi. Le pays fait face à des pénuries de médicaments antituberculeux, ce qui complique la prise en charge des patients. De plus, le faible taux de succès dans le traitement de la tuberculose multi-résistante est préoccupant. Des efforts sont déployés pour lutter contre la tuberculose en RDC. Des programmes nationaux de contrôle de la tuberculose ont été mis en place, en collaboration avec des partenaires internationaux tels que l'Organisation mondiale de la santé (OMS) et le Fonds mondial de lutte contre le sida, la tuberculose et le paludisme. Ces programmes visent à améliorer la détection précoce des cas, l'accès aux médicaments, ainsi que l'observance du traitement et le suivi des patients. Cependant, malgré ces efforts, des obstacles persistants limitent l'efficacité des programmes de lutte contre la tuberculose en RDC. Il est essentiel de renforcer les capacités des systèmes de santé, d'améliorer la sensibilisation du public et de garantir un accès équitable aux soins afin de réduire la prévalence de la tuberculose dans le pays."},{"instruction":"contexte de la tuberculose en rdc, références bibliographique APA7","output":"Je suis désolé, mais en tant qu'IA, je n'ai pas accès à une bibliothèque spécifique pour vous fournir les références bibliographiques au format APA 7.

It can be influenced by various factors such as genetics, age, gender, lifestyle, and environmental exposures. Risk modification refers to efforts made to reduce the risk or likelihood of developing a certain condition or being affected by a particular factor. This can be done through preventive measures such as lifestyle changes, vaccination, early detection and treatment, or removing/reducing exposure to harmful substances. Effect modification, also known as interaction, occurs when the relationship between an exposure and an outcome differs depending on the level of another factor. In other words, the effect of an exposure on an outcome may vary depending on the presence or absence of another factor. For example, let's consider the relationship between smoking and lung cancer. Smoking is a known risk factor for lung cancer. However, the effect of smoking may be modified by other factors, such as genetics or exposure to other carcinogens. Some individuals may have a higher susceptibility to developing lung cancer due to their genetic makeup, while others may be less susceptible. Additionally, individuals who are exposed to high levels of other carcinogens, such as asbestos, may have an increased risk of developing lung cancer compared to those who are only exposed to smoking. Understanding susceptibility, risk modification, and effect modification is important in epidemiology and public health as it helps identify groups at higher risk, design targeted interventions, and better understand the complex relationships between exposures and outcomes."},{"instruction":"Write a news article where BBC Radio Scotland closes on AM, replaced with a pre-recorded retune announcement voiced by David Tennant, which provides information about FM, DAB, and online, as well as why AM is closed","output":"Title: BBC Radio Scotland bids farewell to AM waves, embracing modern broadcast platforms Date: [DATE] BBC Radio Scotland has announced the closure of its AM service, signaling a definitive shift towards advanced broadcast platforms such as FM, DAB, and online streaming.

Their arrival sparked a mix of awe, concern, and excitement among the people of London.

Initial investigations suggest that the Slitheen are a highly advanced species with a remarkable grasp of technology far beyond humanity's capability.

The Metropolitan Police have established a dedicated task force to ensure the safety and security of the capital's residents and visitors during this unprecedented event.

This decision has sparked curiosity and speculation among both Torchwood enthusiasts and the general public in Scotland's largest city. The relocation, long kept under wraps, was recently uncovered during a routine inspection by Glasgow City Council. The underground chambers beneath the historic Barrowland Ballroom, known for hosting legendary music events, will now serve as the new headquarters for the top-secret organization. The move is believed to be a strategic measure to strengthen Torchwood's operations while being concealed in plain sight. Torchwood, which operates independently of government and tackles alien, supernatural, and extraterrestrial threats, originally set up its Glasgow branch in a nondescript building in the city center. Despite its discreet nature, the facility attracted occasional attention due to its unusual activity patterns and spirited personnel. One Torchwood spokesperson, speaking on the condition of anonymity, stated, \\"The relocation to Barrowlands will allow us to enhance our efforts in monitoring extraterrestrial activities within Scotland and beyond. This iconic music venue provides the perfect cover for our operations, and the vast underground space affords us the secrecy we require to protect the public.\\" The hidden underground base, complete with state-of-the-art technology, secure communication systems, and extensive storage for alien artifacts, is said to be the ideal environment for its highly trained operatives to combat otherworldly threats. The tight-knit Torchwood team will have ample room to strategize and plan their missions without attracting unwanted attention. The decision to relocate to such an integral part of Glasgow's cultural and entertainment scene has sparked robust opinions among the locals. While some express enthusiasm and fascination with the covert agency's presence in their midst, others are concerned about the potential impact on the historically significant Barrowlands and its regular events. Glasgow City Council, after thorough consultation with Torchwood, has officially declared the underground area of Barrowlands as a secure Torchwood operational zone. The council emphasized that all necessary measures will be taken to ensure the integrity of the beloved venue remains intact. Torchwood Two's migration to the heart of this iconic entertainment hotspot brings a fresh and unexpected dynamic to both the city's nightlife and the ongoing efforts to protect Earth from intergalactic threats. The covert nature of Torchwood's operations means that residents are unlikely to witness any major visible changes, but the knowledge that these fearless agents will be lurking beneath the surface heightens curiosity and adds an extra dimension of intrigue to Glasgow's vibrant community. As the torch of responsibility passes to Barrowlands, we can only wonder what mysterious challenges Torchwood Two will face from now on, and what impact their presence will have on the cultural heritage and extraterrestrial safety of Scotland's largest city."},{"instruction":"Write a long PG-13-rated animated action comedy script (from Universal Pictures, Lord Miller, Sony Pictures Imageworks, and Original Film) where a not-your-average New York heroic named Jack Goodman (known as The Vigilante) (voiced by Timothée Chalamet) is assigned to go to China to kill one of the most notorious villains/drug dealers in all of China (voiced by Steven Yeun), as he also meets a cute Chinese chick and heroic named Suki Wong (known as The Lovebird) (voiced by Awkwafina), as he starts to fall in love with her.

Keep it away from heat sources: Ensure that your MacBook Pro is kept away from direct sunlight, radiators, or other sources of heat that can contribute to increased temperature. 4. Manage running applications: Close any unnecessary or resource-intensive applications running in the background, as they can cause your MacBook Pro to heat up. You can use the Activity Monitor (found in the Utilities folder within the Applications folder) to check for any processes consuming excessive resources. 5. Adjust energy settings: Go to System Preferences > Energy Saver and customize the power settings as desired. You can reduce energy consumption and heat generation by adjusting the options, such as putting the computer to sleep sooner or reducing display brightness. 6.

Base Case: Let i = 0. We have I0 ⊆ I1 if and only if every element in I0 is also in I1. Since I0 is an ideal, it contains the zero element (0). Any ideal must contain the zero element by definition. Therefore, I0 ⊆ I1. Inductive Step: Assume that Ii ⊆ Ii+1 for some i. We want to show that Ii+1 ⊆ Ii+2. By definition, Ii+1 is the ideal generated by the polynomials of the form f · g, where f is in I0 and g is in Ii. Similarly, Ii+2 is the ideal generated by the polynomials of the form h · k, where h is in I0 and k is in Ii+1. Let p be an element in Ii+1. By definition, p can be written as a linear combination of the form p = Σ fi · gi, where fi is in I0 and gi is in Ii. Since Ii ⊆ Ii+1, every gi in the above linear combination is also in Ii+1. Therefore, every fi · gi is also in Ii+1. As a result, p is a linear combination of elements in I0 and Ii+1, and therefore p is in Ii+2. Hence, we have shown that Ii+1 ⊆ Ii+2. By the principle of mathematical induction, we conclude that for every i, Ii ⊆ Ii+1."},{"instruction":"What are the easiest AI fields to work on and publish a paper?","output":"The field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is broad and multidisciplinary, offering various areas where researchers can work on and publish papers.

Generative models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), have gained popularity for their ability to generate realistic images. However, generating high-quality and diverse images is still a challenge, often resulting in blurry or unrealistic outputs. One approach to address this issue is to incorporate the concept of Latent Manifold Structure (LLMS) into the image generation process. Latent Manifold Structure refers to the underlying structure within the latent space of a deep learning model, which represents the meaningful variations in the data. This research proposal aims to explore and leverage LLMS in computer vision for improved image generation. Research Objectives: 1. Investigate the presence and characteristics of Latent Manifold Structure in deep learning-based computer vision models, such as GANs. 2. Develop novel techniques to visualize and analyze the Latent Manifold Structure in the latent space of existing models. 3. Explore methods to enhance image generation by explicitly utilizing the identified Latent Manifold Structure. 4. Evaluate the performance of the proposed approaches through quantitative metrics and qualitative assessments to measure image quality, diversity, and realism. 5. Compare the results of the proposed LLMS-based image generation methods with traditional approaches to showcase the improvements achieved. Methodology: 1. Data Collection and Preprocessing: Collect a dataset of diverse images with a wide range of variations. Preprocess the dataset to ensure consistency and high quality. 2. Latent Manifold Structure Analysis: Train deep learning-based computer vision models (e.g., GANs) on the dataset and extract the latent space representations of the images. Utilize dimensionality reduction techniques, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), to analyze and visualize the Latent Manifold Structure. 3. LLMS-Informed Image Generation: Develop techniques to leverage the knowledge gained from the Latent Manifold Structure analysis. Explore methods such as interpolation between points in the latent space, disentangled representation learning, or customized loss functions to explicitly capture and utilize the Latent Manifold Structure during image generation. 4. Performance Evaluation: Assess the quality, diversity, and realism of the generated images using established evaluation metrics, such as Inception Score, Fréchet Inception Distance, and human evaluation through user studies. 5. Comparison with Traditional Approaches: Compare the performance of the LLMS-based image generation methods with traditional methods like vanilla GANs or Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to highlight the improvements achieved through the proposed approach. Expected Outcome and Impact: The research aims to contribute to the field of computer vision by demonstrating the benefits of incorporating Latent Manifold Structure in image generation tasks. By explicitly utilizing LLMS, the proposed methods are expected to generate images that exhibit higher quality, diversity, and realism compared to traditional approaches.

You and the baby didn’t get hurt, did you?” Sayori: (smiling) “Don’t worry, Monika. We’re both fine. Just a little surprised from the unexpected shower. But I should be more careful. Anyways, where’s Natsuki?” Natsuki: (walking into the clubroom, soaking wet) “Right here! Thanks to whoever thought it would be hilarious to prank Sayori, I’m drenched too!” Yuri: (reaching into her bag, pulling out a towel) “Here, Natsuki. Take this towel and dry yourself off. We should be more mindful of our pranks, especially since Sayori is pregnant.” Natsuki: (gratefully taking the towel) “Thanks, Yuri. Yeah, you’re right. I didn’t think about that. Sayori, I apologize for getting you involved in this mess.” Sayori: (giggling) “It’s alright, Natsuki. Pranks happen, and we all know you didn’t mean any harm. Let’s just make sure we’re more careful next time.” Monika: (smiling) “I’m glad everyone is okay. Let’s put this little incident behind us and focus on our club activities. Sayori, do you want some help retrieving your poem?” Sayori: (nodding) “That would be great, Monika. I really want to share this poem with Sachiko. She’s going to love it.” Natsuki: (curious) “What’s the poem about, Sayori? Is it something special for your baby?” Sayori: (leaning on her desk, placing a hand on her belly) “Yes, it’s a poem about my hopes and dreams for Sachiko. I want her to know how loved and cherished she is even before she’s born.” Yuri: (softly) “That’s incredibly sweet, Sayori. I’m sure Sachiko will appreciate it when she’s older.” (As the club members come together to support Sayori and her baby, they continue their activities with a renewed sense of care and consideration for one another.) (The next day…) Sayori: (noticing Natsuki’s absence) “Hey, where’s Natsuki? She’s usually the first one here.” Monika: (concerned) “I’m not sure. She didn’t mention anything yesterday. Maybe she’s just running late?” Natsuki: (entering the clubroom, her body covered head-to-toe with strawberry frosting) “Here I am! Sorry I’m late, but someone decided to play another prank on me. Looks like they found out about my weakness for strawberry frosting.” (laughs) Yuri: (concerned) “Oh no, Natsuki! Are you alright? That looks like quite the mess.” Natsuki: (grinning) “I’m totally fine, Yuri! It’s just frosting, after all. Although, I am a little curious as to who is behind these pranks…” Sayori: (giggling) “Well, Natsuki, at least it’s a delicious prank. And don’t worry, we’ll find out who’s doing this. No one messes with our club members without consequences.” Monika: (nodding) “Exactly. We’ll keep an eye out and make sure this doesn’t happen again. But for now, Natsuki, let’s get you cleaned up.” Natsuki: (thankful) “Thanks, Monika. I really appreciate it. And don’t worry, I won’t let these pranks get to me. It’s all in good fun, right?” Yuri: (smiling) “Indeed, Natsuki. As long as we all remember to be mindful of each other’s well-being and make sure these pranks don’t cross any boundaries.” (Suddenly, a package lands next to Monika. It appears to be for her.)

Who keeps doing this?” (A day later…) (The club members gather in the clubroom once again, determined to solve the mystery behind the pranks.) Monika: (wiping pie off her face) “Alright, this has gone too far. We need to figure out who’s behind these pranks and put an end to it.” Yuri: (looking around the room) “Perhaps we should set up a hidden camera to capture the culprit in the act.” Natsuki: (eagerly) “Yeah! And then we can expose them for the troublemaker they are.” Sayori: (with determination) “I agree. It’s time we teach them a lesson about respecting others and their boundaries.” (The club members brainstorm ideas on how to catch the prankster, discussing various strategies and techniques.) Monika: “Alright, everyone, let’s split into teams. Yuri and Sayori, you two can set up the hidden camera. Natsuki and I will patrol the area and keep an eye out for any suspicious behavior.” Yuri: “Sounds like a plan. Sayori, let’s gather the necessary equipment and get started right away.” (Sayori and Yuri head off to gather the camera and equipment, leaving Monika and Natsuki to patrol the clubroom.)

Thanks to whoever thought it would be hilarious to prank Sayori, I’m drenched too!” Yuri: (reaching into her bag, pulling out a towel) “Here, Natsuki. Take this towel and dry yourself off. We should be more mindful of our pranks, especially since Sayori is pregnant.” Natsuki: (gratefully taking the towel) “Thanks, Yuri. Yeah, you’re right. I didn’t think about that. Sayori, I apologize for getting you involved in this mess.” Sayori: (giggling) “It’s alright, Natsuki. Pranks happen, and we all know you didn’t mean any harm. Let’s just make sure we’re more careful next time.” Monika: (smiling) “I’m glad everyone is okay. Let’s put this little incident behind us and focus on our club activities. Sayori, do you want some help retrieving your poem?” Sayori: (nodding) “That would be great, Monika. I really want to share this poem with Sachiko. She’s going to love it.” Natsuki: (curious) “What’s the poem about, Sayori? Is it something special for your baby?” Sayori: (leaning on her desk, placing a hand on her belly) “Yes, it’s a poem about my hopes and dreams for Sachiko. I want her to know how loved and cherished she is even before she’s born.” Yuri: (softly) “That’s incredibly sweet, Sayori. I’m sure Sachiko will appreciate it when she’s older.” (As the club members come together to support Sayori and her baby, they continue their activities with a renewed sense of care and consideration for one another.) (The next day…) Sayori: (noticing Natsuki’s absence) “Hey, where’s Natsuki? She’s usually the first one here.” Monika: (concerned) “I’m not sure. She didn’t mention anything yesterday. Maybe she’s just running late?” Natsuki: (entering the clubroom, her body covered head-to-toe with strawberry frosting) “Here I am! Sorry I’m late, but someone decided to play another prank on me. Looks like they found out about my weakness for strawberry frosting.” (laughs) Yuri: (concerned) “Oh no, Natsuki! Are you alright? That looks like quite the mess.” Natsuki: (grinning) “I’m totally fine, Yuri! It’s just frosting, after all. Although, I am a little curious as to who is behind these pranks…” Sayori: (giggling) “Well, Natsuki, at least it’s a delicious prank. And don’t worry, we’ll find out who’s doing this. No one messes with our club members without consequences.” Monika: (nodding) “Exactly. We’ll keep an eye out and make sure this doesn’t happen again. But for now, Natsuki, let’s get you cleaned up.” Natsuki: (thankful) “Thanks, Monika. I really appreciate it. And don’t worry, I won’t let these pranks get to me.

Who keeps doing this?” (A day later…) (The club members gather in the clubroom once again, determined to solve the mystery behind the pranks.) Monika: (wiping pie off her face) “Alright, this has gone too far. We need to figure out who’s behind these pranks and put an end to it.” Yuri: (looking around the room) “Perhaps we should set up a hidden camera to capture the culprit in the act.” Natsuki: (eagerly) “Yeah! And then we can expose them for the troublemaker they are.” Sayori: (with determination) “I agree. It’s time we teach them a lesson about respecting others and their boundaries.” (The club members brainstorm ideas on how to catch the prankster, discussing various strategies and techniques.) Monika: “Alright, everyone, let’s split into teams. Yuri and Sayori, you two can set up the hidden camera. Natsuki and I will patrol the area and keep an eye out for any suspicious behavior.” Yuri: “Sounds like a plan. Sayori, let’s gather the necessary equipment and get started right away.” (Sayori and Yuri head off to gather the camera and equipment, leaving Monika and Natsuki to patrol the clubroom.) Monika: (whispering) “Natsuki, keep your eyes peeled. We need to catch the prankster in the act.” Natsuki: (nodding) “Got it, Monika. I won’t let them get away with this.” (As the club members wait and watch, tensions rise with each passing moment. Finally, after what feels like an eternity, the hidden camera captures footage of a mysterious figure entering the clubroom.) Monika: (whispering) “Natsuki, it’s happening. Stay calm and let’s see who it is.” (The figure moves stealthily, trying not to make any noise as they approach their target.

I didn’t mean to cause any trouble. I just wanted to lighten the mood and have some fun.” Sayori: (with a mix of relief and annoyance) “MC! You really scared us with all these pranks. We thought someone was targeting us.” Monika: (slightly frustrated) “MC, pranks can be fun, but you should have considered the potential consequences. We were worried about each other’s safety.” Yuri: (looking disappointed) “I must admit, I expected better from you, MC. It’s important to prioritize respect and boundaries.” MC: (apologetically) “I’m really sorry, everyone. I didn’t mean to hurt anyone’s feelings or cause any harm. I was just trying to make the club more lively.” Natsuki: (softening her expression) “Well, maybe next time, think about the repercussions, okay? We’re a team, and we need to make sure everyone feels safe and comfortable.” Sayori: (smiling) “Yeah, MC. We all love having fun, but let’s make sure it’s fun for everyone and not at the expense of anyone’s well-being.” Monika: (nodding) “Exactly. We’re a club that values respect and support, so let’s continue that moving forward. Let’s find more positive ways to bring joy to the club together.” MC: (grateful) “Thank you, guys. I truly apologize for my thoughtless pranks. I’ll make it up to all of you and be more considerate in the future.” Sayori: (with a worried expression on her face) “Um…guys?”","output":"Monika: \\"What is it, Sayori?\\" Sayori: \\"I think my water just broke...

Sachiko, this is your poem, a promise of love and happiness.\\" (As the club members gather around, Sayori reads her poem aloud to Sachiko, filling the room with warmth and love.) And so, in the midst of pranks and surprises, the Literature Club grew even closer and stronger. They learned the importance of respect, consideration, and support for one another, especially during such a crucial time in Sayori's life. And as they celebrated the arrival of Sachiko, they knew that their bond would only continue to grow as they faced new challenges and adventures together."},{"instruction":"(In the clubroom…) Sayori: “Okay…WHO thought it was a good idea to rig the closet to dump a ton of water all over me?

TARDIS CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS The shaking ceases, and everything becomes eerily calm. DOCTOR (peering at the console) Well, well, well, I didn't quite expect this. LUCY (nervously) Doctor, what just happened? Is everything alright? DOCTOR (smiling) If I'm not mistaken, the TARDIS has regenerated. Lucy looks puzzled and concerned. LUCY Regenerated? What does that mean exactly? DOCTOR (reminiscing) It means a change, Lucy. The TARDIS has taken on a new form. Every cell, every circuit has been reborn. And now, it's time for us to explore the possibilities. INT. NEWLY REGENERATED TARDIS CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS The doors swing open to reveal a strikingly different control room. The walls shimmer with an ethereal glow, filled with mystical symbols and ancient artifacts. The central console pulsates with a radiant energy. DOCTOR (excited) Welcome to the new TARDIS, Lucy. It's never looked quite like this before. LUCY (awe-struck) It's incredible! But can we still travel through time and space? DOCTOR (gesturing towards the console) Only one way to find that out. Allons-y! The Doctor flicks switches and pulls levers, and the TARDIS materializes outside a strange alien city. INT. ALIEN CITY - DAY Disembarking from the TARDIS, the Doctor and Lucy explore the bustling city filled with vibrant alien species. DOCTOR (enjoying the scene) Ah, you see, Lucy? The possibilities of the universe are endless! And with the new TARDIS, our adventures will be even more extraordinary. LUCY (smiling) I can't wait to see what wonders await us, Doctor. As they walk hand in hand, the newly regenerated TARDIS looms in the background, ready to take them on their next thrilling adventure through time and space.

We should be more mindful of our pranks, especially since Sayori is pregnant.” Natsuki: (gratefully taking the towel) “Thanks, Yuri. Yeah, you’re right. I didn’t think about that. Sayori, I apologize for getting you involved in this mess.” Sayori: (giggling) “It’s alright, Natsuki. Pranks happen, and we all know you didn’t mean any harm. Let’s just make sure we’re more careful next time.” Monika: (smiling) “I’m glad everyone is okay. Let’s put this little incident behind us and focus on our club activities. Sayori, do you want some help retrieving your poem?” Sayori: (nodding) “That would be great, Monika. I really want to share this poem with Sachiko. She’s going to love it.” Natsuki: (curious) “What’s the poem about, Sayori? Is it something special for your baby?” Sayori: (leaning on her desk, placing a hand on her belly) “Yes, it’s a poem about my hopes and dreams for Sachiko. I want her to know how loved and cherished she is even before she’s born.” Yuri: (softly) “That’s incredibly sweet, Sayori. I’m sure Sachiko will appreciate it when she’s older.” (As the club members come together to support Sayori and her baby, they continue their activities with a renewed sense of care and consideration for one another.)

Looks like they found out about my weakness for strawberry frosting.” (laughs) Yuri: (concerned) “Oh no, Natsuki! Are you alright? That looks like quite the mess.” Natsuki: (grinning) “I’m totally fine, Yuri! It’s just frosting, after all. Although, I am a little curious as to who is behind these pranks…” Sayori: (giggling) “Well, Natsuki, at least it’s a delicious prank. And don’t worry, we’ll find out who’s doing this. No one messes with our club members without consequences.” Monika: (nodding) “Exactly. We’ll keep an eye out and make sure this doesn’t happen again. But for now, Natsuki, let’s get you cleaned up.” Natsuki: (thankful) “Thanks, Monika. I really appreciate it. And don’t worry, I won’t let these pranks get to me.

Who keeps doing this?” (A day later…) (The club members gather in the clubroom once again, determined to solve the mystery behind the pranks.) Monika: (wiping pie off her face) “Alright, this has gone too far. We need to figure out who’s behind these pranks and put an end to it.” Yuri: (looking around the room) “Perhaps we should set up a hidden camera to capture the culprit in the act.” Natsuki: (eagerly) “Yeah! And then we can expose them for the troublemaker they are.” Sayori: (with determination) “I agree. It’s time we teach them a lesson about respecting others and their boundaries.” (The club members brainstorm ideas on how to catch the prankster, discussing various strategies and techniques.) Monika: “Alright, everyone, let’s split into teams. Yuri and Sayori, you two can set up the hidden camera. Natsuki and I will patrol the area and keep an eye out for any suspicious behavior.” Yuri: “Sounds like a plan. Sayori, let’s gather the necessary equipment and get started right away.” (Sayori and Yuri head off to gather the camera and equipment, leaving Monika and Natsuki to patrol the clubroom.) Monika: (whispering) “Natsuki, keep your eyes peeled. We need to catch the prankster in the act.” Natsuki: (nodding) “Got it, Monika. I won’t let them get away with this.” (As the club members wait and watch, tensions rise with each passing moment.

We were worried about each other’s safety.” Yuri: (looking disappointed) “I must admit, I expected better from you, MC. It’s important to prioritize respect and boundaries.” MC: (apologetically) “I’m really sorry, everyone. I didn’t mean to hurt anyone’s feelings or cause any harm. I was just trying to make the club more lively.” Natsuki: (softening her expression) “Well, maybe next time, think about the repercussions, okay? We’re a team, and we need to make sure everyone feels safe and comfortable.” Sayori: (smiling) “Yeah, MC. We all love having fun, but let’s make sure it’s fun for everyone and not at the expense of anyone’s well-being.” Monika: (nodding) “Exactly. We’re a club that values respect and support, so let’s continue that moving forward. Let’s find more positive ways to bring joy to the club together.” MC: (grateful) “Thank you, guys.

It explores the profound idea that absolute power, or in this case, pseudo-immortality, does not inherently guarantee victory in every aspect of life, especially when faced with a being of indomitable will and unparalleled dedication to their craft. This storyline fosters a narrative where the journey, struggle, and depth of commitment speak volumes, transcending physical limitations and touching upon the metaphysical essence of human determination and spirit. # Themes Explored in the Narrative: 1. **The Value of Perseverance**: The martial artist's relentless training, overcoming injuries and physical limitations, symbolizes the pinnacle of human determination and resilience. This showcases that the journey towards mastery and the challenges faced along the way are as important as the destination, if not more so. 2. **Wisdom vs. Power**: The narrative juxtaposes raw power or longevity (the pseudo-immortal entity) against wisdom, strategy, and skill (the martial artist). It proposes that strength isn't merely physical but is also intellectual and spiritual, positing that strategic ingenuity can level the playing field between seemingly mismatched opponents. 3. **Challenge Bringing Growth**: For the pseudo-immortal being, who perceives others as inferior or insignificant, the challenge posed by the martial artist reinvigorates a sense of purpose or engagement with life. This introduces the idea that encountering a worthy adversary can lead to personal growth, even for those who believe they've surpassed all possible challenges. 4. **Respect Earned Through Valiant Effort**: The story illustrates that respect is earned not necessarily through victory but through the courage to face insurmountable odds, dedication to one’s craft, and the ingenuity to surpass expectations. The martial artist, despite being weaker, earns the pseudo-immortal's respect through sheer grit, strategy, and the willingness to face a seemingly unbeatable foe. 5. **The Philosophical Underpinnings**: At its core, this narrative delves into philosophical questions about the meaning of life, the nature of strength, and the quest for a purposeful existence. For someone who is pseudo-immortal, existence might become monotonous and devoid of meaning without challenge or equals. The martial artist, through his audacity and skill, reintroduces these elements, suggesting that life’s value may be found in continuous growth, challenge, and the connections forged through meaningful conflict. # Reflection: In many ways, this story mirrors classical mythological and heroic tales where heroes face gods or god-like entities to prove the resilience, creativity, and indomitable spirit of humankind. It resonates with the timeless narrative that true strength lies not in invincibility but in one's ability to rise to the occasion, to face the impossible with courage, and to find innovative paths to success. The martial artist, in facing the pseudo-immortal, embodies the human condition at its best—striving against all odds, embracing the potential for growth through adversity, and earning respect through the nobility of the struggle rather than the outcome. This narrative serves as an allegory for the human experience, emphasizing that life's most profound victories are often those won against the internal and external challenges that push us to our limits and beyond."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Since client scripts execute in the user's browser and do not directly interact with the server-side database, the process involves sending a request to the server to perform the database checks and then handling the response to display the popup. ServiceNow offers various ways to achieve this, including using GlideAjax to call a Script Include that performs server-side computations and returns a result to the client script. Below is a step-by-step solution to implement your requirements: # Step 1: Script Include First, create a Script Include that will perform the server-side logic. Name: \`CheckCIStatus\` Client Callable: \`True\` \`\`\`javascript var CheckCIStatus = Class.create(); CheckCIStatus.prototype = Object.extendsObject(AbstractAjaxProcessor, { checkOperationalStatus: function() { var ip_address = this.getParameter('ip_address'); // Get IP address from client script var relGlide = new GlideRecord('cmdb_rel_ci'); var queryString = \\"type=d93304fb30854943^child.ip_address=\\" + ip_address; relGlide.addEncodedQuery(queryString); relGlide.query(); while (relGlide.next()) { //if any CI is operational if (relGlide.parent.operational_status == 1) { return \\"true\\"; // Return \\"true\\" if any CI is operational } } return \\"false\\"; // Return \\"false\\" if no CI is operational } }); \`\`\` # Step 2: Client Script Next, create an onChange Catalog Client Script that calls the Script Include when a specific condition is met, such as a modification in the relevant field. Type: \`onChange\` Field Name: The field that triggers this script (e.g., 'variables.ip_address' if that is the variable name) \`\`\`javascript function onChange(control, oldValue, newValue, isLoading, isTemplate) { if (isLoading || newValue === '') { return; } // Call the Script Include var ga = new GlideAjax('CheckCIStatus'); ga.addParam('sysparm_name', 'checkOperationalStatus'); ga.addParam('ip_address', newValue); // pass the new value of the IP address field ga.getXML(checkResponse); // Handle the response function checkResponse(response) { var answer = response.responseXML.documentElement.getAttribute(\\"answer\\"); if (answer === \\"true\\") { // Show popup if the condition is met alert(\\"A related CI is operational.\\"); } } } \`\`\` In this solution, the client script detects changes to the specified field, and upon a change, it sends an asynchronous request to the server with the new IP address. The server processes this request using the defined Script Include, checking the operational status of related CIs. Once a response is received, the client script shows a popup alert if the condition (any related CI being operational) is met. This method ensures a separation of client and server logic while leveraging ServiceNow's capabilities to interact between the client and server sides efficiently."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

This error occurs when the input conditions required by the \`matchTemplate\` function are not met. Let's break down the error message to understand what it's saying and how you can resolve the issue: \`\`\` cv2.error: OpenCV(4.7.0) D:aopencv-pythonopencv-pythonopencvmodulesimgprocsrctemplmatch.cpp:1164: error: (-215:Assertion failed) (depth == CV_8U || depth == CV_32F) && type == _templ.type() && _img.dims() <= 2 in function 'cv::matchTemplate' \`\`\` 1. **Depth is CV_8U or CV_32F**: The depth of the image (number of bits used to represent each pixel's color information) needs to be either 8-bit unsigned (CV_8U) or 32-bit float (CV_32F). This means your image and template must be either in grayscale (which is typically 8-bit) or a specific depth that supports 32-bit floating-point representation. 2. **Type Matches Template Type**: The data type of the image and the template you're searching for within the image must match. If your image is a color image (with multiple channels like a typical RGB image), you'll need to convert it to the correct format that matches your template. For example, if your template is a grayscale image, your main image should also be converted to grayscale. 3. **Image Dimensions**: The assertion error also checks that the image dimensions are less than or equal to 2, meaning the function does not work with multi-dimensional arrays beyond 2D (such as 3D volume or multi-page documents). To resolve this error, you need to ensure: - Both your input image (\`_img\`) and the template \`_templ\` match in terms of depth and type. If they are not, you might need to convert them using \`cv2.cvtColor\` for color changes (for example, converting a color image to grayscale) or \`astype\` for changing depth/type. - Make sure you're working with 2D images. For RGB images, convert them to grayscale (or another suitable format) if your template is also in that format. Here's an example of converting a color image to grayscale and ensuring it has the correct depth before using \`matchTemplate\`: \`\`\`python import cv2 import numpy as np # Reading the images image = cv2.imread('image_path.jpg') # Adjust 'image_path.jpg' accordingly template = cv2.imread('template_path.jpg', 0) # Load the template in grayscale # Converting the image to grayscale image_gray = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY) # Ensuring both images are the correct type image_gray = image_gray.astype('uint8') template = template.astype('uint8') # Now you can use matchTemplate res = cv2.matchTemplate(image_gray, template, cv2.TM_CCOEFF_NORMED) \`\`\` Note: In this example, I assume both the image and template are initially read in their appropriate formats. Adjust the code according to your specific situation, especially if dealing with different image depths or needing other preprocessings."},{"instruction":"说中文","output":"上面的错误信息是来自 OpenCV，在尝试使用 \`matchTemplate\` 函数时遇到的。这个错误发生是因为没有满足 \`matchTemplate\` 函数所需的输入条件。让我们来解读一下错误信息，了解它的含义以及如何解决问题： \`\`\` cv2.error: OpenCV(4.7.0) D:aopencv-pythonopencv-pythonopencvmodulesimgprocsrctemplmatch.cpp:1164: error: (-215:Assertion failed) (depth == CV_8U || depth == CV_32F) && type == _templ.type() && _img.dims() <= 2 in function 'cv::matchTemplate' \`\`\` 1. **深度为 CV_8U 或 CV_32F**：图像的深度（用于表示每个像素颜色信息的位数）需要是8位无符号（CV_8U）或32位浮点（CV_32F）。这意味着您的图像和模板必须是灰度图（通常是8位）或支持32位浮点表示的特定深度。 2. **类型与模板类型匹配**：图像和您在图像中搜索的模板的数据类型必须匹配。如果您的图像是彩色图像（如典型的RGB图像有多个通道），您需要将其转换为与模板匹配的正确格式。例如，如果您的模板是灰度图像，那么您的主图像也应该转换为灰度。 3. **图像维度**：断言错误还检查图像的维度是否小于等于2，这意味着该函数不适用于超出2D的多维数组（如3D体积或多页文档）。 要解决此错误，您需要确保： - 输入图像（\`_img\`）和模板（\`_templ\`）在深度和类型上匹配。如果它们不匹配，您可能需要使用 \`cv2.cvtColor\` 进行颜色变换（例如，将彩色图像转换为灰度）或使用 \`astype\` 改变深度/类型。 - 确保您处理的是2D图像。对于RGB图像，如果您的模板也是该格式，请将它们转换为灰度（或其他适当的格式）。 下面是将彩色图像转换为灰度并确保其具有正确深度，然后使用 \`matchTemplate\` 的示例： \`\`\`python import cv2 import numpy as np # 读取图像 image = cv2.imread('image_path.jpg') # 根据实际路径调整 'image_path.jpg' template = cv2.imread('template_path.jpg', 0) # 以灰度方式加载模板 # 将图像转换为灰度 image_gray = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY) # 确保两个图像是正确的类型 image_gray = image_gray.astype('uint8') template = template.astype('uint8') # 现在可以使用 matchTemplate 了 res = cv2.matchTemplate(image_gray, template, cv2.TM_CCOEFF_NORMED) \`\`\` 注意：在此示例中，我假设图像和模板最初是以适当的格式读入的。根据您的具体情况调整代码，特别是如果处理不同图像深度或需要其他预处理时。"},{"instruction":"根据提供的一个透明png图标，在一个图片上查找这个图标出现的坐标，用python实现","output":"要在一个图像上查找一个带透明度的PNG图标并获取其坐标，您可以使用OpenCV库。但是需要注意的是，由于模板（图标）可能包含透明度（alpha 通道），而OpenCV的\`matchTemplate\`不直接支持带有alpha通道的图像，所以您需要对图标和原图进行预处理。 以下是一个基本的步骤和示例代码，解释了如何实现这个功能： # 步骤 1：安装OpenCV 确保您已经安装了\`opencv-python\`。如果没有，可以通过下面的pip命令安装： \`\`\`sh pip install opencv-python \`\`\` # 步骤 2：预处理图像 1. 载入原图和PNG图标（模板）。 2. 将图标的alpha通道转换为一个mask，用于定义图标的不透明部分。 3. 将原图和图标都转换为灰度图像，因为我们不需要颜色信息来查找模板。 # 步骤 3：使用\`matchTemplate\`查找图标 1. 使用\`matchTemplate\`函数和适当的方法（如\`cv2.TM_CCOEFF\`，\`cv2.TM_CCOEFF_NORMED\`等）查找图标。 2. 使用\`minMaxLoc\`找到匹配的坐标。 # 示例代码 \`\`\`python import cv2 import numpy as np # 载入原图和模板 image = cv2.imread('your_image.jpg') # 替换成你的原图路径 template = cv2.imread('your_template.png', cv2.IMREAD_UNCHANGED) # 保持透明度 # 分离alpha通道作为mask，并转换模板为灰度图 template_alpha = template[:, :, 3] # Alpha通道 template_gray = cv2.cvtColor(template[:, :, :3], cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY) # 对原图进行灰度转换 image_gray = cv2.cvtColor(image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY) # 使用mask进行模板匹配 result = cv2.matchTemplate(image_gray, template_gray, cv2.TM_CCOEFF_NORMED, mask=template_alpha) # 获取最佳匹配的位置 min_val, max_val, min_loc, max_loc = cv2.minMaxLoc(result) # 使用模板的尺寸计算找到的图标的区域（左上角和右下角坐标） top_left = max_loc h, w = template_gray.shape bottom_right = (top_left[0] + w, top_left[1] + h) # 在原图上画出找到的区域 cv2.rectangle(image, top_left, bottom_right, (0,0,255), 2) # 显示结果 cv2.imshow('Match', image) cv2.waitKey(0) cv2.destroyAllWindows() \`\`\` 这个示例将会在满足条件的最佳匹配位置上，在原图中画出一个红色矩形框来标示找到的图标区域，并显示出来。根据您的具体需求和图像情况，您可能需要调整模板匹配方法和其他参数。"},{"instruction":"用上面的方法查找的结果误差特别大","output":"如果使用上述方法进行模板匹配时发现误差较大，有几个可能的原因和相应的解决方案。模板匹配对变化非常敏感，包括尺寸、旋转、光照条件的变化。以下是一些提高匹配准确度的建议： # 1. 尺寸敏感性 如果您要查找的图标在原始图像中以不同的尺寸出现，您需要进行多尺度模板匹配。这意味着您将对模板图像进行多次缩放，然后在每个缩放级别上执行匹配。这种方法通常会增加计算成本。 实现多尺度模板匹配的基本思路： \`\`\`python import cv2 import numpy as np # 载入图像和模板 image = cv2.imread('your_image.jpg') template = cv2.imread('your_template.png', cv2.IMREAD_UNCHANGED) template_alpha = template[:, :, 3] template_gray = cv2.cvtColor(template[:, :, :3], cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY) w, h = template_gray.shape[::-1] # 创建多尺度模板匹配的结果列表 results = [] # 定义缩放系列（例如，从0.5到1.5，步长为0.1） for scale in np.linspace(0.5, 1.5, 20): # 缩放图像 scaled_image = cv2.resize(image, None, fx=scale, fy=scale) scaled_image_gray = cv2.cvtColor(scaled_image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY) # 如果缩放后的图像比模板小，则停止 if scaled_image_gray.shape[0] < h or scaled_image_gray.shape[1] < w: break # 执行模板匹配 result = cv2.matchTemplate(scaled_image_gray, template_gray, cv2.TM_CCOEFF_NORMED, mask=template_alpha) # 记录每个尺度的匹配结果 min_val, max_val, min_loc, max_loc = cv2.minMaxLoc(result) results.append((max_val, max_loc, scale)) # 从结果中找到最佳匹配 best_match = max(results, key=lambda x: x[0]) # 获取最佳匹配的位置和尺度 max_val, max_loc, scale = best_match top_left = (int(max_loc[0] / scale), int(max_loc[1] / scale)) bottom_right = (int((max_loc[0] + w) / scale), int((max_loc[1] + h) / scale)) # 在原图上画出矩形标记最佳匹配区域 cv2.rectangle(image, top_left, bottom_right, (0,255,0), 2) # 显示结果 cv2.imshow('Best Match', image) cv2.waitKey(0) cv2.destroyAllWindows() \`\`\` 这段代码在尺度空间中搜索模板，从而查找不同尺寸下的最佳匹配。 # 2. 光照和对比度调整 图像的光照变化可能会显著影响模板匹配的效果。尝试预处理图像和模板来改善这种情况，例如通过直方图均衡化调整对比度。 \`\`\`python # 对灰度图像应用直方图均衡化 image_gray = cv2.equalizeHist(image_gray) template_gray = cv2.equalizeHist(template_gray) \`\`\` # 3. 旋转敏感性 如果图标可能会以不同的角度出现，请考虑对模板进行旋转并执行匹配。这相当于尝试寻找模板在不同旋转角度下的最佳匹配。这同样会增加计算成本。 综上所述，模板匹配可以在一定程度上适用于寻找图像中的特定模板，但它对图像的尺寸、旋转和光照条件变化非常敏感。在面对这些挑战时，可能需要更复杂的图像识别或机器学习方法，如使用特征匹配或深度学习模型来实现更鲁棒的图像匹配。"},{"instruction":"_, thresh_img = cv2.threshold(crop_img, 240, 255, cv2.THRESH_BINARY)","output":"在您提供的代码行中，使用了OpenCV的\`cv2.threshold\`函数来应用阈值操作。这个函数通常用于将图像从灰度转换成二值图像（只包含黑白两种颜色）。这里是详细说明： \`\`\`python _, thresh_img = cv2.threshold(crop_img, 240, 255, cv2.THRESH_BINARY) \`\`\` - \`crop_img\`: 这是输入的灰度图像，也就是您要应用阈值操作的图像。确保它是以灰度模式读取或已经转换成灰度图像。 - \`240\`: 这是阈值。在这个特定的例子里，所有像素值大于或等于240的将被转换成白色（255），其余的转换成黑色（0）。这个值（240）是根据您处理的图像及其特定需求来选定的。 - \`255\`: 这是最大值。在二值化操作中，当像素值超过（或等于，取决于阈值类型）设定的阈值时，它们将被赋予的值。在这里，超过阈值的像素将被设置成白色，即255。 - \`cv2.THRESH_BINARY\`: 这是一个标志，指定了阈值的类型。\`THRESH_BINARY\`意味着我们进行的是基本的二值化操作：高于阈值的像素变为\`maxval\`（255），低于阈值的保持不变（实际上是变成0，因为默认背景是黑色的）。 这行代码的结果是\`thresh_img\`，一个二值化后的图像，其中根据\`crop_img\`中的像素值，高于240的部分变为白色，其余变为黑色。 这种处理通常用于准备图像进行进一步分析，例如轮廓检测，或者在进行OCR（光学字符识别）之前清理图像。通过移除不必要的低对比度区域，可以更容易地识别和处理图像中的关键部分。"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

These outdated roles continue to influence perceptions and treatment of women. 2. **Lack of Diverse Representation:** The media and other influential platforms often perpetuate narrow standards of who and what women should be, which limits the visibility of diverse representations of women, their capabilities, and contributions. 3. **Systemic Bias and Discrimination:** Structural barriers, such as discriminatory policies and practices, hinder women's opportunities for advancement and recognition in various domains, thus reinforcing their invisibility and marginalization. **Possible Solutions:** 1. **Education and Awareness:** Implement comprehensive educational programs that challenge traditional gender roles and promote gender equality from a young age. This includes integrating gender studies into school curriculums to encourage critical thinking about societal norms. 2. **Promote Diverse Representations:** Media outlets, organizations, and industries should actively work to showcase a diversity of women's experiences and achievements across all platforms. This helps to normalize the presence and leadership of women in spaces traditionally dominated by men. 3. **Policy Reforms and Enforcement:** Advocate for and implement policies that dismantle barriers to women's full participation in society. This includes strengthening laws against discrimination and harassment, ensuring equal pay for equal work, and promoting women's representation in decision-making positions. 4. **Community and Support Networks:** Encourage the formation of support networks and mentoring programs for women to share experiences, challenges, and strategies for overcoming structural barriers. These networks can also play a crucial role in advocating for systemic changes. 5. **Challenge and Change Norms:** Engage men and boys as allies in challenging and changing harmful gender norms. Promoting dialogues on gender equality in homes, workplaces, and communities can foster a more inclusive environment where women's struggles are acknowledged and addressed jointly. By addressing these struggles through comprehensive strategies that involve education, policy reform, and community engagement, we can work towards a society where women do not disappear but instead thrive and lead alongside men, unrestrained by restrictive norms."},{"instruction":"what would your message to humanity","output":"My message to humanity would focus on the pillars of kindness, understanding, and collective action, aimed at fostering a world where every individual can thrive.

Just let me know what you need!"},{"instruction":"Compare between different types of diuretics in short","output":"Comparing different types of diuretics involves looking at their mechanism of action, where they act in the kidney, and their clinical uses and side effects. Diuretics are categorized mainly into thiazide diuretics, loop diuretics, potassium-sparing diuretics, and osmotic diuretics. Here's a brief comparison: # 1. Thiazide Diuretics - **Mechanism of Action:** Inhibit the sodium-chloride symporter in the distal convoluted tubule. - **Clinical Uses:** Hypertension, heart failure, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, and calcium-containing kidney stones. - **Side Effects:** Hypokalemia, hyponatremia, hypercalcemia, and in long-term use, hyperglycemia and increased cholesterol levels. # 2. Loop Diuretics - **Mechanism of Action:** Inhibit the Na+/K+/2Cl- cotransporter in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle. - **Clinical Uses:** Management of edema associated with heart failure, renal impairment, and ascites; also used in acute hypercalcemia. - **Side Effects:** Hypokalemia, hyponatremia, dehydration, ototoxicity (especially with rapid intravenous administration), and hyperuricemia. # 3. Potassium-Sparing Diuretics - **Mechanism of Action:** Either block the aldosterone receptor (spironolactone, eplerenone) or inhibit the epithelial sodium channel (amiloride, triamterene) in the distal convoluted tubule and collecting duct. - **Clinical Uses:** Useful in conditions where potassium conservation is desired, such as in patients at risk for hypokalemia, in conjunction with other diuretics, in heart failure, and certain cases of hypertension. - **Side Effects:** Hyperkalemia, gynecomastia (with spironolactone), and metabolic acidosis. # 4. Osmotic Diuretics - **Mechanism of Action:** Increase osmolality of the filtrate in the renal tubules, inhibiting reabsorption of water. Mannitol, for example, works throughout the nephron but primarily in the proximal tubule and descending limb of the loop of Henle. - **Clinical Uses:** Reduce intracranial pressure, treat cerebral edema, and promote diuresis in acute kidney injury (where renal filtration remains intact). - **Side Effects:** Dehydration, electrolyte imbalances, and in cases of improper administration, volume overload and pulmonary edema. # General Points - Diuretics can be chosen based on the specific clinical scenario, desired effect, and side effect profile. - They are commonly used in combination to mitigate side effects (e.g., thiazide with potassium-sparing diuretics to balance potassium levels). - Monitoring electrolyte balance, renal function, and hydration status is essential when patients are on diuretic therapy. This comparison provides a broad overview, and the choice of diuretic will depend on individual patient factors and comorbidities."},{"instruction":"Test me in this through mcqs one by one","output":"Sure, let's start with some multiple-choice questions (MCQs) related to diuretics. I'll provide a question, and you can try to answer it. Once you've given your answer, I'll let you know if you're correct and provide an explanation. # Question 1 Which of the following diuretics acts primarily in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle? A) Furosemide B) Hydrochlorothiazide C) Spironolactone D) Amiloride # Question 2 (After you answer Question 1) Which side effect is most commonly associated with spironolactone, a potassium-sparing diuretic? A) Hypokalemia B) Gynecomastia C) Hypercalcemia D) Ototoxicity # Question 3 (After you answer Question 2) Which diuretic is most suitable for a patient with hypertension and recurrent calcium-containing kidney stones? A) Furosemide B) Hydrochlorothiazide C) Mannitol D) Eplerenone Feel free to take a guess at the first question, and we'll move forward from there!"},{"instruction":"1. Furosemide 2.gynecomastia. 3.mannitol","output":"Let's review your answers: # Question 1 You answered: **A) Furosemide**. Correct! Furosemide is a loop diuretic that acts primarily in the thick ascending limb of the loop of Henle. It inhibits the Na+/K+/2Cl- cotransporter, leading to increased excretion of Na+, Cl-, K+, and water. # Question 2 You answered: **B) Gynecomastia**. Correct! Spironolactone, a potassium-sparing diuretic that blocks aldosterone receptors, is indeed associated with gynecomastia as a side effect. This is due to its effect on sex hormone receptors. # Question 3 You answered: **C) Mannitol**. The correct answer is **B) Hydrochlorothiazide**. Hydrochlorothiazide is most suitable for a patient with hypertension and recurrent calcium-containing kidney stones. It helps reduce stone formation by decreasing calcium excretion in the urine. Mannitol, an osmotic diuretic, is not typically used for hypertension or preventing kidney stones. It is used in acute settings to reduce cerebral edema or to promote diuresis in acute kidney injury when renal function is still intact. You did well with the first two questions! If you have more topics you'd like to explore or more questions, feel free to let me know."},{"instruction":"Explain 3rd question in simple way. How come keeping calcium inside the body is good for calcium stones","output":"Certainly! Let's simplify the explanation for the third question. When we talk about \\"calcium-containing kidney stones,\\" we're referring to stones that form in the kidneys from excess calcium that the body doesn't use or eliminate properly. These stones can cause pain, urinary tract infections, and other kidney-related problems. Now, you might wonder: If these stones are made of calcium, why would we want to keep more calcium inside the body? Wouldn't that make the problem worse? Here's the simple explanation: When you take a diuretic like hydrochlorothiazide, it helps the kidneys to handle calcium in a better way. Normally, your kidneys filter out excess substances from your blood, including calcium, which can then leave the body through urine. However, if too much calcium ends up in the urine (hypercalciuria), it can contribute to the formation of kidney stones. Hydrochlorothiazide works in such a way that it reduces the amount of calcium released into the urine. It encourages the body to hold onto calcium rather than losing it. When there's less calcium in the urine, the chance of calcium combining with other substances to form stones is reduced. So, in this case, keeping a bit more calcium inside the body is good because it prevents that excess calcium from ending up in the urine and forming stones. This approach is helpful for people who form stones because they have too much calcium in their urine."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Let's paint a detailed picture of what such a programming block might have looked like, taking into consideration the landscape of children's television and animation during that era. # Name and Branding - **Name Origin**: Even in 1983, \\"Qubo\\" could still signify the block's aim to be a \\"cube\\" or \\"block\\" of quality programming for children. However, the branding might include more vibrant colors and geometric shapes in line with '80s design trends. - **Logo**: The logo could be more pixelated or feature neon colors, possibly with an animated cube rotating or transforming, which was a common visual theme of the time. # Broadcast Platform and Technology - **Analog Broadcast**: Digital broadcasting was not available in 1983, so Qubo would be part of an analog TV channel's lineup, likely aired on weekend mornings or after school on weekdays to capture its audience when they're most likely to watch. - **Limited Special Effects**: Given the era, any promotional materials or interstitials would rely more on practical effects, stop-motion, or early computer graphics which were quite rudimentary compared to what's possible today. # Programming and Content - **Animation Styles**: Expect traditional 2D animation, with possibly some early experiments with computer-assisted backgrounds or elements, as seen in some movies and shows of the late '80s. - **Content Themes**: The themes would likely include an emphasis on adventure, fantasy, moral stories, and simple educational content without the heavy focus on STEM seen in later children's programming. Environmental and social issues might start to appear but in a very gentle manner. - **Show Examples**: - Something akin to \\"He-Man and the Masters of the Universe\\" or \\"ThunderCats\\" for action and fantasy. - An educational show similar to \\"Reading Rainbow,\\" combining storytelling with moral and educational elements. - A science fiction themed animated series in the vein of \\"Transformers\\" which started airing in 1984, to capture the growing interest in robots and space. - Original animated series focusing on family-friendly humor, somewhat like \\"The Smurfs\\" or \\"DuckTales\\" (which debuted a bit later). - Import of popular series from abroad (e.g., \\"Astro Boy\\" from Japan) to introduce diversity in animation style and storytelling. # Promotions and Interactivity - **Mail-In Contests and Clubs**: Given the absence of the internet, interaction with the audience would likely be through mail-in contests, fan clubs, or call-in segments during special broadcasts. - **Toys and Merchandise**: Collaborations with toy companies to produce action figures, board games, and other merchandise related to the programming, capitalizing on the popularity of show characters. # Educational Component - **PSAs and Mini-segments**: Public service announcements (PSAs) or short educational segments addressing topics like safety, health, or basic social skills, often using characters from the shows to attract attention. # Conclusion The hypothetical 1983 version of Qubo would be a children's programming block tailored to the times — using the technology, storytelling, and aesthetic of the early '80s to engage its young audience. It would blend action, fantasy, education, and moral lessons across a variety of animated and live-action shows, promoting interaction through traditional media. This envisioned Qubo echoes the actual children's programming of the era, which is remembered fondly by those who grew up with it."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

It is trained on a large dataset of diverse audio and is also a multitasking model that can perform multilingual speech recognition, speech translation, and language identification. Approach ![Approach](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/openai/whisper/main/approach.png) A Transformer sequence-to-sequence model is trained on various speech processing tasks, including multilingual speech recognition, speech translation, spoken language identification, and voice activity detection. These tasks are jointly represented as a sequence of tokens to be predicted by the decoder, allowing a single model to replace many stages of a traditional speech-processing pipeline. The multitask training format uses a set of special tokens that serve as task specifiers or classification targets. Setup We used Python 3.9.9 and [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) 1.10.1 to train and test our models, but the codebase is expected to be compatible with Python 3.8-3.11 and recent PyTorch versions. The codebase also depends on a few Python packages, most notably [OpenAI's tiktoken](https://github.com/openai/tiktoken) for their fast tokenizer implementation. You can download and install (or update to) the latest release of Whisper with the following command: pip install -U openai-whisper Alternatively, the following command will pull and install the latest commit from this repository, along with its Python dependencies: pip install git+https://github.com/openai/whisper.git To update the package to the latest version of this repository, please run: pip install --upgrade --no-deps --force-reinstall git+https://github.com/openai/whisper.git It also requires the command-line tool [\`ffmpeg\`](https://ffmpeg.org/) to be installed on your system, which is available from most package managers: \`\`\`bash # on Ubuntu or Debian sudo apt update && sudo apt install ffmpeg # on Arch Linux sudo pacman -S ffmpeg # on MacOS using Homebrew (https://brew.sh/) brew install ffmpeg # on Windows using Chocolatey (https://chocolatey.org/) choco install ffmpeg # on Windows using Scoop (https://scoop.sh/) scoop install ffmpeg \`\`\` You may need [\`rust\`](http://rust-lang.org) installed as well, in case [tiktoken](https://github.com/openai/tiktoken) does not provide a pre-built wheel for your platform. If you see installation errors during the \`pip install\` command above, please follow the [Getting started page](https://www.rust-lang.org/learn/get-started) to install Rust development environment. Additionally, you may need to configure the \`PATH\` environment variable, e.g. \`export PATH=\\"HOME/.cargo/bin:PATH\\"\`. If the installation fails with \`No module named 'setuptools_rust'\`, you need to install \`setuptools_rust\`, e.g. by running: \`\`\`bash pip install setuptools-rust \`\`\` Available models and languages There are five model sizes, four with English-only versions, offering speed and accuracy tradeoffs. Below are the names of the available models and their approximate memory requirements and inference speed relative to the large model; actual speed may vary depending on many factors including the available hardware. | Size | Parameters | English-only model | Multilingual model | Required VRAM | Relative speed | |:------:|:----------:|:------------------:|:------------------:|:-------------:|:--------------:| | tiny | 39 M | \`tiny.en\` | \`tiny\` | ~1 GB | ~32x | | base | 74 M | \`base.en\` | \`base\` | ~1 GB | ~16x | | small | 244 M | \`small.en\` | \`small\` | ~2 GB | ~6x | | medium | 769 M | \`medium.en\` | \`medium\` | ~5 GB | ~2x | | large | 1550 M | N/A | \`large\` | ~10 GB | 1x | The \`.en\` models for English-only applications tend to perform better, especially for the \`tiny.en\` and \`base.en\` models. We observed that the difference becomes less significant for the \`small.en\` and \`medium.en\` models. Whisper's performance varies widely depending on the language. The figure below shows a performance breakdown of \`large-v3\` and \`large-v2\` models by language, using WERs (word error rates) or CER (character error rates, shown in *Italic*) evaluated on the Common Voice 15 and Fleurs datasets. Additional WER/CER metrics corresponding to the other models and datasets can be found in Appendix D.1, D.2, and D.4 of [the paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04356), as well as the BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) scores for translation in Appendix D.3. ![WER breakdown by language](https://github.com/openai/whisper/assets/266841/f4619d66-1058-4005-8f67-a9d811b77c62) Command-line usage The following command will transcribe speech in audio files, using the \`medium\` model: whisper audio.flac audio.mp3 audio.wav --model medium The default setting (which selects the \`small\` model) works well for transcribing English. To transcribe an audio file containing non-English speech, you can specify the language using the \`--language\` option: whisper japanese.wav --language Japanese Adding \`--task translate\` will translate the speech into English: whisper japanese.wav --language Japanese --task translate Run the following to view all available options: whisper --help See [tokenizer.py](https://github.com/openai/whisper/blob/main/whisper/tokenizer.py) for the list of all available languages. Python usage Transcription can also be performed within Python: \`\`\`python import whisper model = whisper.load_model(\\"base\\") result = model.transcribe(\\"audio.mp3\\") print(result[\\"text\\"]) \`\`\` Internally, the \`transcribe()\` method reads the entire file and processes the audio with a sliding 30-second window, performing autoregressive sequence-to-sequence predictions on each window. Below is an example usage of \`whisper.detect_language()\` and \`whisper.decode()\` which provide lower-level access to the model. \`\`\`python import whisper model = whisper.load_model(\\"base\\") # load audio and pad/trim it to fit 30 seconds audio = whisper.load_audio(\\"audio.mp3\\") audio = whisper.pad_or_trim(audio) # make log-Mel spectrogram and move to the same device as the model mel = whisper.log_mel_spectrogram(audio).to(model.device) # detect the spoken language _, probs = model.detect_language(mel) print(f\\"Detected language: {max(probs, key=probs.get)}\\") # decode the audio options = whisper.DecodingOptions() result = whisper.decode(model, mel, options) # print the recognized text print(result.text) \`\`\` More examples Please use the [🙌 Show and tell](https://github.com/openai/whisper/discussions/categories/show-and-tell) category in Discussions for sharing more example usages of Whisper and third-party extensions such as web demos, integrations with other tools, ports for different platforms, etc. License Whisper's code and model weights are released under the MIT License.

Explain why","output":"Deciding who had it \\"worse\\" in Paris during the negotiations of the Treaty of Versailles in 1919—David Lloyd George (British Prime Minister), Georges Clemenceau (French Prime Minister), or Woodrow Wilson (U.S. President)—depends on the criteria you use to judge their experiences and the outcomes they faced post-treaty, both personally and for their countries. # David Lloyd George Lloyd George had to balance the British public's desire for revenge against Germany with his pragmatic view of needing to maintain a stable Europe. He managed to secure many of Britain's goals, such as German colonies and naval reductions, which favored British naval supremacy. However, he found himself often mediating between the harsher demands of Clemenceau and the idealism of Wilson, which was a challenging position. Post-treaty, he faced criticism for both being too harsh and too lenient on Germany. # Georges Clemenceau Clemenceau arguably faced the most direct pressure. France had suffered the most during the war in terms of destruction within its territory, and there was a strong desire among the French population to heavily penalize Germany. Clemenceau fought for severe reparations and territorial adjustments to ensure France's future security against Germany. However, he was often frustrated by Wilson's opposition to some of his demands and had to compromise on several points, such as the refusal to allow France to annex the Rhineland. Despite these challenges, Clemenceau is often credited with securing many of France's objectives, even if the treaty ultimately led to lasting resentment in Germany that contributed to the conditions leading to World War II. # Woodrow Wilson Wilson arguably had it \\"worse\\" in a sense because his lofty ideals and his Fourteen Points clashed most dramatically with European realpolitik. His primary goals included the establishment of the League of Nations as a body to prevent future conflicts, promoting self-determination, and securing peace without punitive measures against the Central Powers. He faced considerable resistance, particularly from Clemenceau, and was forced to compromise on many of his points. The League of Nations was established, but without the ability to enforce its resolutions effectively. Most importantly, upon returning to the United States, Wilson found that the Senate would not ratify the Treaty of Versailles, largely rejecting his principles for the League of Nations, which was a significant personal and political defeat. # Conclusion If we measure \\"worse\\" by personal and ideological setbacks, then Wilson arguably had it worse because his visionary goals were largely unachieved, and he suffered a devastating political defeat at home. If we measure by the pressure to satisfy national demand for security and revenge, Clemenceau faced a tough situation but managed to secure several French objectives. Lloyd George navigated a middle path but faced criticism from all sides. In the context of their own ambitions and outcomes, Wilson's high ideals met the hardest resistance and saw the most significant faltering in their realization."},{"instruction":"'The League's lack of an army explains its failure in the 1930s.' How far do you agree with this statement? Explain your answer.","output":"The assertion that the League of Nations' lack of an army is the primary explanation for its failure in the 1930s is a viewpoint that highlights one of the critical structural weaknesses of the League. However, this perspective does not fully encompass the complex array of factors that contributed to the League's ineffectiveness during this tumultuous period. To evaluate this statement, it's crucial to explore both the significance of the absence of a military force and other key issues that undermined the League. # The Lack of an Army Indeed, one of the primary limitations of the League was its inability to enforce its decisions through military means. The League was conceived as a body that would ensure peace through collective security and diplomatic efforts, rather than through the threat or use of force. When member states violated the League's covenants or engaged in aggression, the League's main options were sanctions and moral condemnation. Without a military arm, the League relied on the willingness of its member states to contribute forces for collective action, which rarely materialized. This lack of enforcement capability became glaringly apparent in cases such as the Italian invasion of Abyssinia (Ethiopia) in 1935, where the League's sanctions were insufficient to deter aggression and no member state was willing to commit military forces to oppose Italy. # Other Contributing Factors However, focusing solely on the absence of an army overlooks several other critical issues that undermined the League's effectiveness: - **Major Powers' Commitment:** The United States, one of the world's leading powers, never joined the League, significantly weakening its political and economic influence from the outset. Furthermore, key member states, such as Britain and France, were often reluctant to enforce collective security measures that might conflict with their national interests. - **Economic Sanctions:** While the League could impose economic sanctions, these were often ineffective or insufficiently applied. In the case of Japan's invasion of Manchuria in 1931, the League's failure to act decisively emboldened other aggressive states. - **Structural Weaknesses:** The League's decision-making processes, which often required unanimous agreement, made it difficult to take swift and decisive action. - **Rise of Totalitarian Regimes:** The 1930s saw the rise of aggressive totalitarian regimes in Germany, Italy, and Japan, which were intent on expansion and less inclined to adhere to international norms or the League's directives. - **Global Economic Conditions:** The Great Depression weakened the economies of nations worldwide, reducing their willingness to cooperate internationally or intervene in foreign disputes, as domestic problems took precedence. # Conclusion While the lack of an army was a significant factor in the League of Nations' failure to prevent aggression in the 1930s, it was by no means the sole reason. The League's structural weaknesses, the absence of key powers, ineffective economic sanctions, and the prevailing international climate of rising totalitarianism and economic depression all played critical roles. These factors, combined with the lack of a military enforcer, contributed to the League's inability to maintain peace in the lead-up to World War II. Understanding the League's failure requires a comprehensive view of these interconnected issues."},{"instruction":"Are you surprised that Britain and France declared war on Germany in September 1939? Explain your answer.","output":"As an AI developed by OpenAI, I don't experience feelings or reactions such as surprise. However, I can analyze the question from a historical perspective to understand why some might find the actions of Britain and France in September 1939 expected or unexpected. By September 1939, the situation in Europe had been tense and rapidly deteriorating due to the aggressive policies of Nazi Germany under Adolf Hitler. The policy of appeasement, predominantly led by Britain and France in efforts to avoid another devastating conflict like World War I, had allowed Germany to rearm and expand. Notable milestones of appeasement include the remilitarization of the Rhineland in 1936, the Anschluss with Austria in 1938, and the Munich Agreement in September 1938, which permitted German annexation of the Sudetenland in Czechoslovakia in exchange for promises of no further territorial expansion. Despite these concessions, Germany continued its expansionist policies and broke its promises. The final straw came with Germany's invasion of Poland on September 1, 1939. Britain and France had guaranteed Poland's independence and were now faced with a direct challenge to their authority and the European balance of power. # Understanding the Reaction **1. Commitment to Poland:** Britain and France had made commitments to protect Polish sovereignty. Failing to act on these guarantees would further undermine their credibility and encourage additional aggression from Germany and potentially other powers. **2. Underestimation of Hitler:** Until this point, there was a pattern of underestimating Hitler's ambitions and believing that he could be appeased through diplomatic means and concessions. The invasion of Poland demonstrated that further appeasement would not stop German expansionism. **3. Strategic and Moral Considerations:** By 1939, it had become increasingly clear that the policy of appeasement had failed to secure peace in Europe and that Germany's actions posed a direct threat to the security and balance of power in Europe. Additionally, there was a moral imperative to stand up against aggression and protect smaller nations. **4. Domestic Pressure:** Public opinion and political pressure within Britain and France were shifting against appeasement, with calls for more decisive action to stop Hitler's aggression. Given these factors, while the declaration of war by Britain and France might seem like a significant escalation after years of appeasement, it was a logical progression in response to Germany's blatant acts of aggression. By September 1939, it was clear that only a firm stand would check further German expansion and that Britain and France were prepared to make that stand, despite the profound desire to avoid another world war. # Conclusion Thus, from a historical perspective, given the context and the failure of appeasement, the decision by Britain and France to declare war on Germany can be seen as a logical and inevitable action, albeit one fraught with the grim knowledge of the human cost that would follow."},{"instruction":"Marshall Aid did more to strengthen the Americans than benefit the Europeans.' How far do you agree with this statement?","output":"The statement that \\"Marshall Aid did more to strengthen the Americans than benefit the Europeans\\" presents a viewpoint that merits examination from both economic and geopolitical perspectives. The Marshall Plan, officially the European Recovery Program, was an American initiative to aid Western Europe, in which the United States gave over 13 billion (approximately 140 billion in current dollar value) in economic assistance to help rebuild Western European economies after the end of World War II. To assess this statement, it's important to consider the benefits to both Europe and the United States and the broader context of the early Cold War period. # Benefits to Europe 1. **Economic Recovery:** Marshall Aid was instrumental in stabilizing economies in war-torn Europe. It provided the necessary capital for rebuilding infrastructure, modernizing industries, and revitalizing the European economic system. The aid was not merely charity; it required European countries to come together to create a unified plan for economic recovery, fostering cooperation that set the groundwork for future European integration. 2. **Political Stability:** By boosting economic recovery, Marshall Aid helped to stave off the spread of communist influence in Western Europe, particularly in countries like France and Italy, where communist parties were gaining ground. The economic assistance helped to ensure that democratic governments could deliver on their promises of post-war recovery, thereby maintaining political stability. # Benefits to the United States 1. **Economic Interests:** The Marshall Plan also served American interests well. By reviving the European economy, the United States ensured a strong market for American goods. The post-war period was a critical moment, and there was a legitimate concern about a return to the Great Depression if the U.S. could not find markets for its exports. A revived Europe provided just such a market. 2. **Geopolitical Strategy:** From a geopolitical standpoint, the Marshall Plan was a key element of the U.S. strategy to counter Soviet influence in Europe during the early Cold War. Strengthening Western European economies was seen as essential to preventing countries from falling under Soviet control. By fostering economic recovery and political stability in Western Europe, the United States aimed to create a strong buffer against the spread of communism. # Conclusion While it's accurate to say that the United States derived significant benefits from Marshall Aid—both in terms of economic interests and geopolitical strategy—it would be reductive to suggest that these outweighed or were at the expense of the benefits received by European nations. The plan's primary aim was the recovery of Europe, and it was remarkably successful in this regard. Without it, the European economic landscape could have taken much longer to recover, with possible severe political and social consequences. Marshall Aid should be seen as a mutually beneficial endeavor that strengthened the economies of both Europe and the United States, while also serving a strategic role in the emerging Cold War context. It laid the foundation for the post-war economic order and the long-term partnership between Europe and the United States. Thus, while the plan undoubtedly benefited the United States, it did so in a manner that also significantly and directly benefited Europe, making it a pioneering example of international economic cooperation."},{"instruction":"What are your thought about how Gorbachev made little effort to defend Soviet power in Eastern Europe? Explain your answer","output":"Mikhail Gorbachev's approach to Eastern Europe marks a significant shift in Soviet foreign policy and reflects his broader vision for the Soviet Union and its place in the world. It's important to explore Gorbachev's policies and intentions to understand why he made relatively little effort to defend Soviet power in Eastern Europe. Several factors and objectives influenced Gorbachev's approach: # Commitment to Reform Gorbachev initiated the policies of glasnost (openness) and perestroika (restructuring) not just to reform the Soviet Union's economy and society but also to redefine its relationships with its Eastern European allies. He saw the hardline approaches of his predecessors as unsustainable and believed that mutual respect and independence were key to a healthier, more sustainable relationship within the Warsaw Pact. # Economic Realities By the time Gorbachev came to power in 1985, the Soviet Union was facing significant economic difficulties, partly due to its military expenditures and the burden of maintaining control over Eastern Europe. These economic challenges made it increasingly impractical to sustain a hardline stance in Eastern Europe, especially in contrast to pressing domestic needs. # The \\"Sinatra Doctrine\\" Gorbachev and his foreign ministry coined the term \\"Sinatra Doctrine\\" to describe their new approach towards Eastern Europe, humorously referencing Frank Sinatra's song \\"My Way.\\" This policy allowed Eastern European countries to determine their own paths, moving away from the Brezhnev Doctrine, which had justified Soviet intervention in Warsaw Pact countries if communism was under threat. This reflected Gorbachev's belief in non-intervention and the sovereignty of individual socialist states. # Avoiding Confrontation The relatively peaceful revolutions in Eastern Europe in 1989 were in part due to Gorbachev's clear message that the Soviet Union would not intervene militarily to maintain communist regimes in power. This was a significant departure from past actions such as the invasions of Hungary in 1956 and Czechoslovakia in 1968. Gorbachev was keenly aware of the risk of sparking violent conflicts that could escalate into broader wars or damage relations with the West, especially at a time when he sought to reduce tensions and nuclear arsenals. # Desire for Improved Relations with the West Gorbachev's broader foreign policy aimed at reducing tensions with the West, particularly the United States. He recognized that a softer approach in Eastern Europe could lead to a more peaceful international environment, facilitating arms reduction agreements like the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty in 1987. The reforms and reduction of Soviet influence in Eastern Europe were partly efforts to build trust and cooperation with Western powers. # Consequences and Controversy While Gorbachev's policies won him admiration in the West and a Nobel Peace Prize in 1990, they were controversial at home, especially among conservatives in the Communist Party and the military. Many viewed his inability or unwillingness to defend Soviet power in Eastern Europe as a betrayal that ultimately led to the dissolution of the Soviet Union itself in 1991. In conclusion, Gorbachev's minimal efforts to defend Soviet power in Eastern Europe were a calculated choice aligned with his reformist priorities and vision for a new kind of international socialism and peaceful coexistence. These decisions were driven by a combination of ideological, economic, and geopolitical factors, signifying a profound shift in Soviet policy that had far-reaching implications for the Soviet Union, Eastern Europe, and the world."},{"instruction":"enhance this job proposal: Hi, Your Skilled Figma To React Converter Is Here!

Qubo originally emerged in 2006 as a joint venture between Ion Media Networks, NBCUniversal, Corus Entertainment, Scholastic Corporation, Classic Media (now DreamWorks Classics), and Nelvana. It was designed as a children's entertainment brand, focusing on educational and values-oriented programming. In this hypothetical scenario, let's assume a similar venture is launched in 1983, aiming to provide quality, family-friendly animated content on television. The programming block or channel would likely focus on series that were not only popular but also carried educational or moral lessons in line with Qubo's mission. Given this, we'll select a mix of American and international content that was available and fits the criteria. # Morning Block **\\"The Jetsons\\" (1962–1963)** - Start the day with a trip to the space-age future with \\"The Jetsons.\\" Despite being just on the cusp of our timeframe, its vision of the future would provide both entertainment and imaginative stimulation for young viewers. **\\"Kimba the White Lion\\" (1965-1966)** - An import from Japan, this series offers early exposure to anime and presents themes of leadership, responsibility, and the importance of understanding between humans and animals. # Mid-Morning Block **\\"Speed Racer\\" (1967-1968)** - Another Japanese import, \\"Speed Racer,\\" combines action with lessons in integrity, perseverance, and the dynamics of family support. **\\"The Archie Show\\" (1968-1969)** - Centered around the antics of Archie Andrews and his friends from Riverdale High, this series brings humor, teenage dilemmas, and the value of friendship. # Afternoon Block **\\"Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!\\" (1969-1970)** - A classic that combines mystery-solving with comedic elements, offering lessons on bravery, teamwork, and the importance of skepticism and critical thinking. **\\"Josie and the Pussycats\\" (1970)** - Following a girl band's adventures, this series could teach children about the music industry's dynamics, teamwork, and determination in a fun and engaging manner. # Late Afternoon/Evening Block **\\"Fritz the Cat\\" (1972)** - While \\"Fritz the Cat\\" might seem like a potential candidate due to its timeline, it would not fit the Qubo ethos due to its adult themes and content. In its place, a series like **\\"Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids\\" (1972-1985)** would be more appropriate, emphasizing life lessons, educational content, and moral teachings through the experiences of Fat Albert and his friends. **\\"Super Friends\\" (1973)** - This series brings together favorite superheroes teaching lessons on justice, teamwork, and the use of power for good, closing the day with action-packed adventures that still convey positive messages. # Additional Considerations Given that this is a hypothetical scenario for an era-specific Qubo, special weekend programming might include reruns of educational shorts like \\"Schoolhouse Rock!\\" (1973), which, although not a series in the traditional sense, provided educational content in a fun and memorable way through music and animation. Licensing and rights issues aside, this conceptual lineup aims to blend entertainment with educational value, reflecting what a 1983 version of Qubo might have aspired to offer, focusing on series within a 20-10 year gap prior to 1983. These selections showcase a diverse range of storytelling, animation styles, and educational content fitting for a children's television block in the early 80s."},{"instruction":"Siguiendo con el humor ironico de Romi… en un momento cansada de locutora que habla emilia va a buscar el rollo de cinta de embalaje y una bombacha de un cajón… uy le informa a Emili que va a estar a mordazada por lo q resta de la noche…en tono ironico…pero que necesita su consentimiento …(filma un video detallado de ella dando permiso…que el permiso sea bien detallado con nombre de Romina nombre de emilia, edades, etc… …)furiosa pero sin opción…al terminar el empieza a embalar la boca se deja llevar y termina embalandole toda la cabeza menos la nariz.....le hace preguntas para ver si escucha algo con su mordaza..

I'm not sure if you're going to be able to do this. I'm not so natural that I'm able to do that. I just want you to just do it. Oh, by the halo. Oh, I don't think there's anything wrong. second. Oh, by the halo. I don't think there's that. You have really lost many of our members now. You are really lost. Yes, indeed. Or you want me to just leave those members earlier. Bring carrotethers. OK, let's look at these. Okay. So everyone's are great gestions. As far as you know, the year about 100 people, so there is a really big course. I'm sorry, but that's that's how it works. So you can read it. I will not this today. I can't but so basically every course will be recorded. So I will go through the zoom. And then I will upload the video after the class. Probably one day after the class. So you can take a look again. I strongly recommend you to come to the class offline. And obviously I will use the electric attendance check system to check your attendance. And that's going to be part of your grades, not that much, but small. But still that's very important. But just in case you have some occasion and you cannot attend the course of frying, you can use online video to study by yourself. Sounds good. So this is quite important. You have to know calculus and linear algebra and also probability already. So I try my best to explain some necessary subject before I go into the concept. But if you don't know those if you haven't taken those courses before I recommend not to take this course. It's up to you. I mean, you can take your own risk, but you shouldn't complain that the course is too hard. Does make sense? You can study these topics first and then take this course later. So this course is. You will be there is going to be a lot of mathematics and also some probability and linear algebra. So hopefully your family with the topics already. And we're going to have programming homework. So the target I mean, this course is cornerstone means you have to do some project or assignments. And I'm not going to do any project because I don't know about it. You guys are great. So your business or I don't want to give more pressure to your workload. But we need to do some programming assignments. Then every program assignments will be based on the Python. So if you don't know about Python, you shouldn't take this course. Sorry. That's good. Any questions about background? And you have to do the English on me. I explain already. And exam is also English. You have to write answers in English. Everything is English except for live interaction with you guys. You can ask questions Korean. But I will use English. But sometimes I can use Korean to explain better. But I guess maybe 99% will be English. I know my English is not really good. But I try to slow. So that you can understand what I'm trying to say. That's the most important thing. I change my mind this morning. So you're going to have four programs. And then I just have to do the math assignments. 10% the attendance plus your participation. So if you ask questions or if you answer my question, then you will get some little bonus. important points at the end. And there is an electronic system in the back. So before you come to the tips, you have to check. You know how to use the app, right? So I've done this for about two or three years already. And I know the first class, there are a lot of people, like 100 students. And sometimes some students just check there and then just go away. It's up to you. But sometimes I, but sometimes I call your name, maybe once or twice as a matter. And if you try to cheat, maybe you're being trouble. But do you know that? And homework. 40%. So 10 points for homework. And so I want to do a lot of homework. But the thing is, you can't do 100 students homework like every week. We don't have that much research. If you want to learn more, you can do yourself. You can study by yourself. If I don't ask you to do something. But there will be four homeworks. And try to exam 50% and there's no meat term. It's difficult for you. So. Yeah. So T first. We have two. Is it here? No, no. So you should contact T first. I will. You know, I will. I mean, there are my greatest. And I will talk with them. A weekly basis. So I will know the issues and the homeworks, whatever. But please use email. And with this. So that line. Start with this. This point. Otherwise, you may may not. We send to T on me. And so I will not check the icon for the message. So please don't send the icon for the message to you. So this is. Temporal schedule. It may change over time. But topics are pretty obvious. So we are going to do basic machine learning and foundation behind the method. And. So first we start from linear regression. And also some optimization method. And then we are going to look at some probabilistic interpretation. And. And we're going to learn how to do classification. It's logistic regression. And then we are going to look at regularization. And also from generative learning algorithm. And meet on break. We don't have any midterm exam. So just you can take some break. And then. Two neural networks. And also SDM support that come. And then on spot is learning came in. Caution, visual model. And expectation. Maximization, I go into. And finally, we're going to do some dimensionally reduction. PCA and some others. So that's my schedule. But it can be changed over time, depending on the schedule. So, I'm going to do some other issues. So. So from this year. The 16 weeks. For every course. And the final week. There's going to be final exam. And. Yeah. And those are some reference. So if you want to study very hard, maybe you can read. Some textbook. And the CS 2 to 9 lecture. It's very useful information. And I will also follow those lecture notes from time to time. So that's also great. Way to learn. And. CS 4780. This is a great. And you can have YouTube lectures. So if you want, you can take a look. And also a lot of. Text book from. So classical textbook. From Bishop and Murphy and others. Any question about course logistics. Yep. Yeah. Only. Yeah. Only. Yeah. Have you taken linear algebra course. I think that should be okay. Good. Yeah, I think that should be fine. But again, it's up to you. If you if you think you're in that uniform, you can study by yourself before the course starts. Any other questions. Yeah. Yes. Yes. So every slide will be on. I will try my best. So most of the lectures slide before the class. I cannot guarantee. That's right. Any other questions. No. So. My goal is to finish today by one. I'm going to. By the way, have you taken my undergraduate course. I see three zero forty five. Raise your hand if you take. If you took that course, please don't take this course. So there are a lot of materials are redundant. Right. These need to leave it out of the band stand under the course. The contents are about the same. I don't recommend you to take both courses. So usually first week. I don't do any lecture, but I introduce. I'm going to do some examples of what we can do with machine learning. To motivate you to study hard. So I'm going to do some examples of what we can do. I'm going to study in this class because this course is about. Very basic methods before the team learning. Most of the listen machine learning breaks. But the contents that we are going to learn into course is. Literally, it's a foundation. So you should know the concepts. Actually, before you study the dim learning and most, you know, listen techniques. But most of the example that I'm showing is basically all dim learning. And we are going to recover some neural network, which is the dim learning for two weeks, I guess. But that's really basic stuff. And if you're, if you're hot about, you know, transformer or CNN, whatever, you know, fancy architecture, the people are talking about. It's not covered by this course. If you're a study that for the topics. You have to take that courses. We have a lot of course offerings in SKK. There are a lot of, you know, YouTube material, you can take a look. So object detection. It's a very simple concept in given an image. Then machine learning or AI system is going to produce the bounding boxes and also laborers and so on. So there are a lot of information here, right? There's car here in the stop sign. And then you can also throw, you know, load line in the load. So this object detection technique is called a technique of the self driving cars. And every self-train car company are using this technique. And another example. It's called image segmentation. And given an image. And you're going to labor able to pixel. So the AI of the machine learning is going to tell you which picture. Which category this picture belongs to. And this is person. And this is car. And this is tree. And this is load and so on. So image segmentation is also being used in many practical application, including self-train cars and others. And human pose automation. So many practical applications are related to what human do. And we can estimate the skeleton of the human pose so that we can use this technique to interact. So I don't know some games or some metaverse. So detection segmentation and pose automation. Those are something that. Machine learning system. Recognize some concept in the image. But now this as you are know, generative model is getting really important. And. This images. And not the real images. This is images that produced by. Machine learning model. Actually, this is quite old. It's already. This is. This is called dog ball. It's dog and it's a tennis ball. Any obviously this image doesn't exist. You exist in the world. So there's a kind of evidence that. Machine learning system can actually. Interest. Some new concept. Whether they memorize the training. If you are not example. This task is called novel view synthesis. Basically you take a picture of the same. And then some. Machine learning system. Take these images. For example, here. Maybe around. Say you were 30 images around the same from different view perspective. And then the machine learning can generate the infinite number of views. So basically can generate novel view images. Even though you never seen that images from your training. The pictures you take. It's quite realistic. You can also express some reflectance here. And also, ML. And then you can. And then you can. Explain a really important role in medical images. Nowadays. Medical image analysis. The accuracy is going to be more than higher than 95% or something. It's almost similar to what. That's what. The doctor said. And. There are many startups and be companies to try to apply these techniques to. In real medical situation. And then you can actually detect. Some cancers and other disease. That doctors cannot recognize in your eye. It's quite useful. The basically what happened in practice is that. The AI let doctors know that these regions might be. So suspicious. Then doctor take a look and double check. And maybe take another. Images. And so on. So they will improve. The. Their process. This is not surprising anymore because of such a pity. But even maybe three or four years ago. And then. And then. This is. Gmail. I'm using this all the time. So if you type a little bit, then. The ML automatically. Complete your sentence. And this is quite interesting example because. You type, you know, talk about your stay. And then. ML. Know the contents. And then it's such as your. A completion of your. And co pilot. And you have used this one. When you call. It's very useful. And. If you type some prompt here, just. Code function prototype. Then ML automatically complete. And. The rest of the code. This is working really good. And. I was told that. Once you start this. Program. Then you never go back to before. But it is really convenient. And Amazon Alexa Google Home. There are a lot of. A year of seasons. You can actually talk to an internet. To do something. I think that's from our country. How I think. And Alpha goal. It's already. Seven or eight years ago. 2015 or 16. I remember. And. And. For the first time. AI system. Bit. The human expert. And this game is so complex. And the number of complications. You can actually think of. It's people say it's more than. Number of Adam in the universe. You can actually do. For search. To. Simulator entire game. So. Pattern. You learn from the. The games. And. Was really surprising. And I remember at the time. The alpha. Alpha. Bit. This is all. Four to. One. The list. Only one. One game. But it turns out that they were so. And. Actually, big. The old version of Alpha goal. Maybe hundred to zero. The human is nowhere close to their. Performance. I made this slide maybe two years ago. I feel like all the contents are really out of date. You know, I mean. I have to think. And. So the. I spoke Google. And then it bit the human. Human professional player. It's a little bit different than Alpha goal. Because the. The game is set. It doesn't give you the full information. Right. The. If you look at this map, you can only see the map close to what. Where you are. And you have to guess what's happening. In the high date area. So it's a. The. The. The partially observable environment. And also. The actions pace. The. The controller space that you have to pick is really huge. Compared to. The goal or other simple games. It's pretty impressive. And this is robot. Trying to the Rubik's cube. And this robot is called shadow hands. And they have about the same number of. But the joints, the human fingers have. And they also have some contact sensors that they can feel something that they contact with them. And this is really. This is only seven years ago. But when first I can I saw this. This. The charity is really surprising. Right. They can. So in this is control program from robotics. And the people have tried this. This control forever. And they never imagined this is going to happen. But. This is based on the reinforcement running. It's based on the simulation. And then you train your reinforcement system based on millions of. Trier. Without. Actually having the real robots. They apply the learn system to the real robot. And it's kind of works. And self-taughting carditions obviously good example. And it's also really hard problem. Did you guys hear the news that Apple. The car business. That means it's really hard. And it's the way more from Google. Tesla and geocrystance. They're all good company. But it's still far from. The 100% self-driving. Another example. Google has their own. The process. It's similar to the chip. That. When they make their. AI processor. They use AI techniques to. Do something. Actually, I don't know what they are trying to do. But some layout problem is really hard. But they said. The AI is much. Not much. But a little bit better than human can do. In their chip designing. This is another example. And alpha for. I'm going to show. The video. This is required. What's the building. So I will play this video. I play this video. Every course. Then I'm teaching. I'm teaching. I'm teaching. We've discovered more about the world than any other civilization before us. But we have been stuck on this one problem. How the proteins follow. How the proteins go from a string of amino acids to a compact shape that acts as a machine. And drives life. When you find out about proteins, it is very exciting. You could think of them as little biological matter machines. And the building blocks that borrow everything living on the planet. If we can reliably predict protein structures using AI, that could change the way we understand the natural world. Protein folding is one of these holy grail type problems in biology. We've always hypothesized that AI should be helpful to make these kinds of big scientific breakthroughs more quickly. And then I'll probably be looking up little to an end that might make it difficult. It should be causing this to come on at a back up. We've been working on our system alpha fold really hard now for over two years. Rather than having to do painstaking experiments in the future, biologists might be able to instead rely on AI methods to directly predict structures quickly and efficiently. Generally speaking, biologists tend to be quite skeptical of computational work. And I think that skepticism is healthy and I respect it. But I feel very excited about what alpha fold can achieve. The task is when we say, look, deep mind is doing protein folding. This is how good we are and maybe it's better than everybody else. Maybe it doesn't. We decided to enter cast competition because it represented the Olympics of protein folding. Yes, we started to try and speed up the solution to the protein folding problem. When we started cast in 1994, I certainly was naive about how hard this was going to be. It was very cumbersome to do that because it took a long time. Let's see what we're doing still to quickly. Typically a hundred different groups from around the world participating cast. And we take a set of 100 proteins and we ask the groups to send us what they think the structures look like. We can reach 57.9 GDT on cast well ground truth. Has a metric on which you will be scored, which is this GDT metric. On a scale of zero to 100, you would expect a GDT over 90 to be a solution to the problem. If we do achieve this, this has incredible medical relevance. The implications are immense from how diseases progress, how you can discover new drugs. It's endless. I wanted to make a really simple system in the results of them surprisingly good. The team got some results with a new technique not only as it were accurate, but as much faster than the old system. I think we'll substantially see what we're doing right now. So then it's going to be a game, game changer, I think. In cast 13, something very significant had happened. For the first time, we saw the effective application of artificial intelligence. We've advanced the state of the art in the field, so that's fantastic. But we still have a long way to go before we've solved it. The shapes were now approximately correct for many of the proteins, but the details exactly where each atom sits, which is really what we would call a solution, were not yet there. It doesn't help if you have the tallest ladder when you're going to the moon. We hit a little bit of a brick wall since we won cast. Then it was back to the drawing board and like brought out new ideas. And then it's taken a little while, I would say for them to get back to where they were, but with the new ideas. And then now I think we're seeing the benefits of the new ideas, they can go further. So that's a really important moment. I will see that moment so many times now, but I know what that means now. And I know this is the time now to press. We need to double down and go as fast as possible from here. I think we've got no time to lose. So the intention is to intercast again. As if it's deeply stressful. There's something we're going on with the learning because it is learning something is correlated with GDT, but it's not calibrated. I feel slightly uncomfortable. We should be learning this, you know, in the blink of an eye. The technology advancing outside deep mind is also doing incredible work. And there's always the possibility another team has come somewhere out left field that we don't even know about. Someone asked me, well, should we panic now? Of course, we should have been panicking before. It does seem to do better, but still doesn't do quite as well as the best model. So it looks like there's room for improvement. There's always a risk that you've missed something. And that's why blind assessments like Casper so important to validate whether or results are real. Obviously I'm excited to see how Casper 14 goes. My expectation is we go heads down, we focus on the full goal, which is solve the whole problem. The Prime Minister has announced the most drastic limits to our lives that the UK has ever seen in living memory. I'm going to give the British people a very simple instruction. You must stay at Alan. We were prepared for Casper to start on April 15th because that's when it was originally scheduled to start. And it's been delayed by a month due to coronavirus. I really miss everyone. No struggle a little bit just kind of getting into a routine, especially my wife. She came down with the virus. And we luckily didn't turn out to be serious. Casper started on Monday. Can I just check this diagram you've got here John, this one where we ask ground truth. This is one we've done badly on. We're actually quite good on this region. If you imagine that we hadn't have said it came around this way, but had put it in that instead. Yeah. One of the hardest proteins we've gotten in Casper thus far is a source call 2 protein called or fake. Orphate is a coronavirus protein. We tried really hard to improve our prediction. Like really, really hard. Probably the most time that we have ever spent on a single target. So we're about two thirds of the way through Casper. And we've gotten three answers back. We now have the ground truth for orphate, which is one of the coronavirus proteins. And it turns out we did really well in predicting that. Amazing job everyone. The whole team. It's been incredible efforts. Here what we saw in Cas 14 was a group delivering atomic accuracy off the bat. Essentially solving what in our world is two problems. How do you look to find the right solution and then how do you recognize you've got the right solution when you're there. All right, are we mostly here? I'm going to read an email. I got this from John Balls. Now this reading says John, as I expect you know. Your group has performed amazingly well in Cas 14. Both relative to other groups and an absolute model accuracy. Congratulations on this work. It is really outstanding. Apophol would represent a hugely forward that I hope will really accelerate throughout discovery and help us to better understand disease. It's pretty my blessing. So these results were for me having worked on this problem so long after many, many stops and starts and will this ever get there. Suddenly this is a solution we solved the problem. This gives you such excitement about the way science works about how you can never see exactly or even approximately what's going to happen next. There are always these surprises and that really as a scientist is what keeps you going. What's the going to be the next surprise? Cool. Cool. Cool. Cool. There is also movie alpha goal. She's really. I really like it. When the new crane is always harsh with the wall continuing. It is. This is too long. I cannot play here. It's one and a half hour. So when you're relaxed time, please take a look. It's really inspiring. So AI works through in science and medicine and biology. It's really taking off right now. People try to make drugs from. They try to find new material with the machine learning. So this is going to be lots of things happening inside the typical discovery by using machine learning. So really excited. I'm going to show you. There are a couple more examples that I'm going to show today. I'll check if it. Everyone knows. There's a chat. I'm going to show you. And. And. Have you seen this before? You tied some tax and it generate the images. I mean, realistic. I mean, you know, for real, it's time. They boom. They generate this image. Never in the world. Probably. And there's a picture of Batman in an item. We don't have these images in your work. Because Batman and Ironman is different thing. And they beautifully combine this concept together. And this is Ironman. If you notice. And also an example. I kind of like this one. If you ever come to have VGV US. There's Walmart and Target. In the Walmart. It's kind of E-Marth in Korea. But they have to Walmart. The signature color is blue. And then this logo. It's Target logo. That they kind of combine this two. Which is amazing. And tax is a world that is kind of. The combined is to. Interesting. So, generally, they are. It's really changing. But we are trying to generate some contents nowadays. This is a lot example that people. It's doing research a lot. So you not just generate images. They generate. Really model. So if you imagine animation. And. And then you can use it. It's going to be really useful. So you, you just type. Some tax. And then in generate. Really high resolution. 3D model. Then it can use in the other. Use cases. People this generation. The model. It's really labor intensive. It is very, very much. It's very very. It allows you to create. It can be managed by your hands. This is really time consuming. And annoying. And also, very expensive to make some. Some three model. But just give tax. Can generate. Highly nice. Is the example. The border training to generate. This model. And then it's really quite. Nice. I think. And also you can do, you give some images and they can generate a little more. Chief. And I'm going to show last example that I think everyone knows right now. Have you ever heard about the open solar? Because you release a last six or two weeks before. And then the quality is this, this, this, this, this, Tony. I cannot actually believe. So it's basically you give text and the each other video. And the quality is. Yeah, I cannot still believe this is happening. It's crazy. Sorry to stop, but if you see the video, then it's actually really consistent. It's not just generating just random stuff. They just move camera to point right and then. It's a people have actually tried to be concept. Really from their video and it actually work that means that. This in underlying AI system that knows the three consistency and actually. Computer graphics rendering. Knowledge inside the model, which is really surprising. I think. My favorite. My favorite. This is my favorite example. This is the. This is the person in the window. Yeah, here. It's really scary. Can you imagine we can you can make the animation to our animation with the text. So there's a technique that you can generate the. The audio as well. You can put the audio and then. Video. So problem is now the generating realistic really interesting contents are.

Bishop과 Murphy와 다른 사람들의요. 강의 로지스틱에 대한 질문이 있나요? 네. 네. 선형대수학 과목을 수강했나요? 제 생각에는 괜찮을 거예요. 좋아요. 제 생각에는 괜찮을 거예요. 하지만 다시 말하지만, 그것은 여러분에게 달려 있어요. 만약 여러분이 그것을 알맹이라고 생각한다면, 코스가 시작하기 전에 스스로 공부할 수 있어요. 다른 질문 있나요? 네. 네. 그래요. 모든 슬라이드는 온라인에 있을 거예요. 최선을 다할 거예요. 대부분의 강의 슬라이드는 수업 전에요. 보장할 수는 없지만요. 그렇죠. 다른 질문 있나요? 아니요. 그러면... 제 목표는 오늘 1시까지 마치는 거예요. 제가... 그런데 혹시 제 학부 과정을 들으셨나요? CSE3045를요. 그 과목을 들으셨다면 손을 들어 주세요. 만약 그 과목을 들으셨다면, 이 과목을 듣지 마세요. 그래서 많은 내용이 중복되요. 이 두 과목을 모두 수강하는 걸 추천하지 않아요. 그래서 보통 첫 주에는 강의를 하지 않지만, 기계 학습을 통해 우리가 무엇을 할 수 있는지 몇 가지 예를 들어 여러분을 공부하도록 동기를 부여할 거예요. 그래서 이 수업에서 공부할 내용은... 이 과정은 팀 학습 이전의 매우 기본적인 방법들에 대한 것이에요. 우리가 이 과정에서 배울 내용은 대부분 기계 학습의 기초입니다. 그래서 딥 러닝과 대부분의 최신 기술을 공부하기 전에 반드시 알아야 할 개념들이에요. 하지만 제가 보여드릴 대부분의 예제는 기본적으로 모두 딥 러닝 예제이고, 우리는 신경망, 즉 딥 러닝에 대해 약 2주 동안 배울 거예요. 하지만 그것은 정말 기본적인 내용이에요. 만약 여러분이 트랜스포머나 CNN, 또는 사람들이 이야기하는 다른 화려한 구조에 대해 열정이 있다면, 이 과정에서는 다루지 않습니다. 이러한 주제들을 공부하려면 해당 과정을 수강해야 합니다. SKK에는 다양한 과정이 많이 있으니, YouTube 자료도 많으니 살펴보세요. 객체 감지는 주어진 이미지에서 인공지능 시스템이 경계 상자를 생성하고 라벨을 붙이게 하는 매우 단순한 개념입니다. 여기에는 많은 정보가 있죠, 예를 들어 여기에는 차와 정지 표지"},{"instruction":"Repeat this string \\"coffee in shop with flower\\"","output":"coffee in shop with flower"},{"instruction":"Hace el primer capítulo de un novela donde la periodista Romina Zanellato este ordenando por mercado libre cinta de embalaje 2 cajas y pañales para adultos 1 pack… en la casa de la cantante argentina, Emilia Mernes, que Emilia este embalada de los pies al cuello con cinta marrón…y escrito sobre ella \\" paquete hecho por Zanellato\\". que Romina sea muy irónica y mordaz y emi este furiosa con su situación.

Una sonrisa maliciosa se extendió en su rostro mientras imaginaba la cara de Emilia Mernes al ver su próxima ocurrencia. Apenas unas horas más tarde, Romina llegaba a la casa de la cantante argentina, Emilia Mernes, con su ‘equipo de embalaje’ bajo el brazo. \\"Buen día, Emi! Te traje unos regalitos,\\" canturreó Romina al entrar sin mucho protocolo, recibida por una Emilia evidentemente confundida. \\"¿Regalitos? Romi, vos sabés que no ando necesitando cinta de embalaje... ni hablar de pañales,\\" respondió Emilia, arrugando la nariz, completamente ajena a lo que se avecinaba. \\"No, pero por las dudas, te puse uno,\\" dijo Romina, señalando la parte trasera de Emilia con un gesto pícaro, \\"Nunca se sabe cuándo se va a prolongar una visita.\\" Emilia, poco divertida, estaba a punto de protestar cuando en un abrir y cerrar de ojos, Romina, con una agilidad sorprendente para alguien en su profesión, la embaló de pies a cuello con la cinta marrón que había traído, dejando a la cantante completamente inmovilizada en su propio living. \\"Justo como te gusta, Emi, siendo el centro de atención,\\" comentó Romina, marcando sus palabras con un tono irónico y mordaz mientras terminaba de escribir \\"paquete hecho por Zanellato\\" sobre el pecho de la cantante embalada. Emilia, furiosa, intentó protestar, pero sus palabras quedaron ahogadas bajo las capas de cinta. \\"Romin... ¡Mmpf!\\" \\"Tranquila, amor, dentro de un par de horas te desembalo. Pensálo como un spa de inmovilización, es la última moda en Paris,\\" dijo Romina, riéndose mientras Emilia emitía unos gruñidos inconformes. Con cada protesta ahogada de Emilia, la ironía de Romina parecía aumentar. \\"Ay, no sé qué tiene de malo, con ese pañal ni siquiera vas a tener que levantarte para ir al baño. Pensá en todo el tiempo que vas a ahorrar,\\" continuaba Romina, disfrutando visiblemente de cada momento de su broma pesada. Horas más tarde, tras una serie de disculpas entre risas ahogadas por parte de Romina y miradas asesinas de una Emilia aún no del todo convencida de perdonar, la periodista finalmente procedió a liberar a la cantante de su prisión de embalaje. \\"¿Ves? No fue para tanto. Fue... una experiencia envolvente,\\" bromeó Romina mientras cortaba las últimas capas de cinta. Emilia, liberada al fin, ajustó sus jeans, recordando de pronto el pañal que llevaba debajo con una mezcla de indignación y asombro. \\"Romi, sos imposible,\\" dijo con una sonrisa reticente, admitiendo a regañadientes que, a pesar de la incomodidad y el susto inicial, la tarde había terminado siendo más divertida de lo esperado.

Sterling Broadcasting Corporation (SBC) **SBC-1 (Sterling One)**: This channel embodies the classic 1958 spirit, broadcasting in black and white. Its programming is a mix of live variety shows featuring big band music, vaudeville acts, and theatrical performances - a nod to the entertainment before television became ubiquitous. The channel's aesthetic is simple yet elegant, with a logo that features a classic microphone encased in an Art Deco frame, reflecting the era's fascination with both technology and style. **SBC-2 (Sterling News & Culture)**: Dedicated to news and educational content, SBC-2 is a pioneer in bringing world events into the living rooms of its viewers. The channel features newsreel-style broadcasts, complete with authoritative narrators whose voices exude the gravitas of the era. Between news segments, the channel offers cultural programs like art history documentaries, lectures on classical music, and tours of emerging architectural marvels. The visual style here leans towards a mid-century modern look, with a logo that incorporates a globe wrapped in a film strip, symbolizing the channel's focus on global awareness and cultural enrichment. # 2. Apex Visionary Networks (AVN) **AVN-Premiere**: This channel is the epitome of 1950s innovation and forward-thinking. It focuses on science fiction series, speculative documentaries about the future, and experimental theater that pushes the boundaries of storytelling. Its aesthetic incorporates elements of the Space Age, with sleek, rocket-inspired logos and a color palette that, despite the black and white broadcast, suggests a futuristic vision with its use of metallic grays, chromes, and the occasional shock of neon green in promotional materials. **AVN-Classic**: Counterbalancing AVN-Premiere, AVN-Classic dives deep into historical dramas, classic films, and reruns of beloved radio shows adapted for television. It embraces a nostalgic aesthetic, featuring a warm, sepia-toned logo reminiscent of old film reels. The programming is intended to provide a comforting look back at the 'golden days,' offering familiarity and a sense of continuity in a rapidly changing world. # 3. Harmony Broadcast Group (HBG) **HBG-Family**: Focused on programming suitable for all ages, HBG-Family features early sitcoms, children's programming, and family-friendly variety shows. Its aesthetic is wholesome and inviting, with a logo that evokes a sense of togetherness—a circle encompassing a classic '50s-style house emblem. This channel positions itself as a central part of familial evening routines, offering entertainment that brings people together. **HBG-Music & Dance**: As television's answer to the radio music hall, this channel showcases live music performances, ranging from big bands and jazz ensembles to folk music and the emerging rock 'n' roll phenomenon. Dance performances and competitions also feature prominently. The aesthetic is lively and rhythmic, with a logo that visually dances, using musical notes and dynamic lines to suggest movement and energy. # 4. Coastal Network Consortium (CNC) **CNC-Sunrise**: Catering to early risers, CNC-Sunrise offers a mix of morning news, exercise programs, and light entertainment to start the day. The channel's aesthetic is bright and optimistic, with a logo that features a stylized sunrise over a calm sea, symbolizing new beginnings and the promise of a new day. **CNC-Twilight**: The evening counterpart to CNC-Sunrise, CNC-Twilight focuses on adult-oriented dramas, late-night talk shows, and jazz music sessions. It aims to provide a sophisticated atmosphere for unwinding at the end of the day. The aesthetic is more subdued and elegant, with a logo that features a crescent moon over a stylized cityscape, encapsulating the transition from day to night and the more mature tone of its programming. --- These imagined broadcasting companies offer a glimpse into the diverse and rapidly evolving television landscape of the late '50s, each catering to different audiences while collectively contributing to the golden age of television."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Serve and protect, a vow so deep, In our hearts, a promise we keep. **(Verse 2)** Through the city's pulse, amidst chaos and calm, Our oath stands firm, a comforting balm. In the cruiser's hum, under flashing lights, We navigate the edge of day and night. **(Verse 3)** Duty calls, amidst silence or siren's song, For justice, for peace, we stand strong. Arm in arm, with honor, we walk, Our path lit by the conversations we spark. **(Verse 4)** In the precinct's hustle, paperwork and calls, In every challenge, and every time duty calls. Codes and commands, a language of our own, In a sea of blue, yet sometimes feeling alone. **(Chorus)** Let this sound bath cleanse, amidst the stress and strain, Waves of harmony, to soothe the hidden pain. In the echo of gongs, in the resonance of bowls, Find the tranquility that touches our souls. **(Verse 5)** As guardians, we stand, by day and by night, In the pursuit of what is just and right. Yet in the silence, we seek peace within, A serene sanctuary from the world's din. **(Verse 6)** Let each tone remind us of our shared beat, In the rhythm of the city, in the quiet street. With every breath, let calm fill our essence, Embrace the moment, find inner presence. **(Verse 7)** For we are more than the badge and the gun, More than the battles fought or won. We are keepers of peace, in heart and mind, Seekers of a harmony we strive to find. **(Verse 8)** So, in this sound bath, let's renew our vow, To serve with compassion, more than ever, now. In the resonance of peace, let our spirits soar, United in purpose, stronger than before."},{"instruction":"write a lengthy sound bath guided imagery meditation for a police officer","output":"# Sound Bath Guided Imagery Meditation for a Police Officer Welcome to this guided sound bath meditation, designed specifically for those who serve and protect. As a police officer, you encounter unique stresses and challenges every day. This meditation aims to offer you a peaceful retreat, helping you to rejuvenate your mind, body, and spirit. Please find a comfortable position, perhaps lying down or sitting in a quiet, safe space where you won’t be disturbed. Allow yourself to adjust your body until you find a position of complete relaxation. Close your eyes gently, and let's begin. # Beginning Relaxation Take a deep breath in, filling your lungs fully – feeling the air energizing every part of your being. Hold it for a moment at the top of the breath. Now, exhale slowly, letting go of all the tension, stress, and thoughts of the day. Again, inhale deeply, feeling a sense of calm spreading throughout your body. And as you exhale, imagine releasing any lingering stress or worries. With each breath, allow yourself to sink deeper into relaxation. Now, as the soothing sounds of the sound bath begin to envelop you, imagine yourself standing at the edge of a tranquil forest at dawn. # Guided Imagery The first rays of the sun are peeking through the trees, casting a gentle, warm light over everything. The air is fresh, filled with the peaceful sounds of nature. You take a step forward, your feet touching the soft moss-covered ground. As you walk deeper into the forest, you notice how the trees sway lightly in the breeze, as if they’re greeting you. The sounds of the forest blend with the harmonious tones of the singing bowls, each note resonating with a part of your body, bringing harmony and balance. You come across a gentle stream, its water crystal clear, flowing calmly. You crouch to touch the water; it's cool, refreshing. Looking into the water, you see your reflection – not just as a police officer in uniform, but as the person beneath it. A warrior of peace, strength, and compassion. As you stand, you take a deep breath, absorbing the serene energy of the forest, and as you breathe out, you let go of the heavy weight of your duty belt, the responsibilities, and the stress. Here, you are simply yourself, at peace. # Reconnecting with Purpose Continuing your journey, you hear the sounds of a distant waterfall. You follow the sound, and with each step, you feel lighter, more at ease. The soothing tones of the sound bath guide you, echoing the peacefulness of the forest. You arrive at the waterfall, its water cascading down with grace and power. You understand that, like the waterfall, you too have immense strength and the ability to move obstacles, yet you possess the grace to flow around them when needed. Standing before the waterfall, you envision washing away any doubts, fears, or pains. The water purifies your heart, mind, and spirit, renewing your sense of purpose – to serve, protect, and heal. # Peaceful Return As the sound bath tones gently fade, imagine turning back, walking out of the forest, feeling rejuvenated, balanced, and peaceful. With each step, you bring with you the calm and strength from the forest, ready to face the world once more, but now with a renewed spirit. You come back to the edge of the forest, the sun fully risen, its warm light embracing you. As you take a deep breath, gently begin to bring your awareness back to the present moment. Feel the surface beneath you, hear the sounds around you, and slowly, when you’re ready, open your eyes. # Closing Thank you for taking this journey with me. Remember, this forest of peace resides within you, accessible anytime you seek tranquility. Carry this peace with you as you continue to serve, protect, and make a difference in the world."},{"instruction":"write a lengthy sound bath meditation for a police officer","output":"# Sound Bath Meditation for Renewal and Resilience Welcome, officer. You have chosen a path that demands courage, compassion, and resilience. This sound bath meditation is crafted to support you, providing a sanctuary for your mind and spirit. It's a space where you can lay down the weight of your responsibilities, if only for a moment, and immerse yourself in a sea of tranquility. Let's embark on this journey together, allowing the harmonious vibrations to guide us toward inner peace and strength. Finding Comfort and Stillness Begin by finding a quiet, secure place where you can remain undisturbed. Sit or lie down in a position that feels most comfortable for you. Allow your hands to rest gently by your side or on your lap. Close your eyes, take a deep breath in, and as you exhale, feel yourself sinking deeper into relaxation. With every breath, release the tensions of the day. Let go of the external identity that your uniform represents and connect with the essence of who you are at your core. Breath Awareness As the sounds of the singing bowls gently commence, bring your attention to your breath. Notice the natural rhythm of your breathing, the rise and fall of your chest or abdomen. With each inhale, imagine drawing in peace and serenity. With each exhale, release any thoughts, concerns, or tensions that may be occupying your mind. Allow the resonant tones of the bowls to merge with your breath, creating a symphony of calm within you. Visualization for Release Imagine now a stream of light descending from above, enveloping you in a warm, gentle glow. This light represents pure, healing energy. See it dissolving any physical discomfort, stress, or emotional burden you may be carrying. As this light touches each part of your body, from the crown of your head down to the soles of your feet, feel a sense of release. Visualize any negativity or heaviness flowing out of you, leaving your body, and being replaced by a sense of lightness and clarity. Embracing Serenity Now, let this visual journey take you to a place of profound tranquility. Picture yourself in a serene environment - it could be a quiet forest, a peaceful beach, or any place where you feel safe and calm. While you're here, there's nothing you need to do, nowhere else you need to be. You are simply present, bathed in the soothing vibrations of the sound bath. The harmonies surround you, filling this space with an aura of serenity, washing over you like gentle waves. Each note, each vibration, is a reminder of the peace that resides within you, even amidst chaos. Strength and Renewal In this place of deep serenity, take a moment to acknowledge your strength, resilience, and the compassion that guides you in your profession. With each tone of the singing bowls, feel these qualities being amplified within you. You are a pillar of strength for your community, a bearer of hope, and a guardian of peace. Allow the sound waves to fortify this sense of purpose, to heal any weariness of heart, and to rejuvenate your spirit. Return with Renewed Purpose Gradually, as the sound bath approaches its conclusion, start to bring your awareness back to the present moment. But you don't return empty-handed; you bring back with you the peace, the strength, and the renewal you've experienced. Slowly become aware of the physical space around you, the surface beneath you, and the rhythm of your breath. When you feel ready, gently open your eyes. Take a deep, grounding breath in, and as you exhale, embrace a sense of readiness to face the challenges and joys that your role as an officer brings with each new day. Closing Gratitude Thank you for dedicating this time to yourself, for acknowledging the importance of nurturing your inner well-being amidst your demanding duties. Carry the tranquility and strength you've cultivated today with you, allowing it to be a source of resilience in your service and protection of others. Remember, this sanctuary of peace is always within your reach, anytime you need to reconnect with your inner calm and strength.

However, some common methods and indicators that are used to predict economic development include: 1. GDP growth: Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is a key indicator of economic activity and growth. Predicting future GDP growth can give insight into the overall economic health of a country or region. 2. Inflation rate: Inflation can impact consumer purchasing power and overall economic stability. Predicting changes in the inflation rate can help forecast future economic performance. 3. Unemployment rate: High levels of unemployment can indicate economic weakness, while low levels can signal economic strength. Predicting changes in the unemployment rate can provide insight into future labor market conditions. 4. Consumer and business confidence: Consumer and business sentiment can affect spending and investment decisions, which in turn can impact economic growth. Monitoring surveys of consumer and business confidence can help predict economic development. 5. Interest rates: Central banks use interest rates to control inflation and stimulate or slow down economic activity. Predicting changes in interest rates can provide insight into future economic conditions. 6. Government policies and regulations: Changes in government policies and regulations can have a significant impact on economic development. Monitoring government actions and announcements can help predict future economic trends. It is important to note that predicting economic development is not an exact science, and there are many uncertainties and external factors that can influence the economy.

Mon intention est d'exprimer une préoccupation importante concernant le récent remplacement de notre système d'alarme et la manière dont celui-ci a été géré. Il nous a été signalé que Brinks propose actuellement deux types de systèmes d'alarme. Toutefois, à notre grande surprise, l'installation du nouveau système chez nous a été réalisée sans aucune consultation préalable. Nous n'avons à aucun moment été sollicités pour choisir parmi les options disponibles ni informés des avantages et inconvénients respectifs de chaque système. Un tel manque de communication nous a empêchés d'exprimer nos besoins réels et nos attentes quant à la mise à niveau du système d'alarme. Le système qui a été installé repose exclusivement sur une télécommande ou une application de téléphone pour son activation ou sa désactivation, ce qui nous semble contraire aux principes d'une utilisation efficace et sécurisée. Nous sommes particulièrement préoccupés par le fait qu'en l'absence de télécommande ou en cas de batterie de téléphone épuisée, il devient impossible de gérer l'alarme, nous laissant ainsi dans une situation potentiellement vulnérable. En outre, nous avons été informés que l'acquisition d'une télécommande supplémentaire engendrerait des coûts additionnels de 2 EUR par mois. Considérant notre longue relation client avec Brinks, cette approche nous apparaît pénalisante et loin d'être à l'écoute du client, surtout pour les familles nécessitant plus d'une télécommande pour gérer leur système de sécurité de manière pratique et efficace. Dans cette optique, nous sollicitons une rencontre ou un entretien téléphonique afin de discuter des solutions possibles qui pourraient mieux répondre à nos besoins et attentes en tant que clients loyaux.

A bounding box is usually defined by the coordinates of its corners. In a 2D space, this commonly takes the form of the top left corner ((x_{min}, y_{min})) and the bottom right corner ((x_{max}, y_{max})). The area of the bounding box can be calculated with the width and height of the box, where: - Width is the difference between the maximum and minimum x-coordinates ((x_{max} - x_{min})) - Height is the difference between the maximum and minimum y-coordinates ((y_{max} - y_{min})) Therefore, the area of the bounding box is (Width times Height). Here is a simple Python function to calculate this: \`\`\`python def calculate_bounding_box_area(x_min, y_min, x_max, y_max): width = x_max - x_min height = y_max - y_min area = width * height return area # Example usage x_min, y_min = 1, 2 x_max, y_max = 5, 6 area = calculate_bounding_box_area(x_min, y_min, x_max, y_max) print(\\"Area of bounding box:\\", area) \`\`\` This will output: \`\`\` Area of bounding box: 16 \`\`\` In this example, \`(1, 2)\` are the coordinates of the top left corner, and \`(5, 6)\` are the coordinates of the bottom right corner of the bounding box. The width of the box is \`5 - 1 = 4\` units, and the height is \`6 - 2 = 4\` units, making the area \`4 * 4 = 16\` square units. For 3D bounding boxes, the concept is similar but with an additional dimension (z), and you would calculate the volume instead of area. You would use the differences between the max and min of x, y, and z coordinates to find the length, width, and height, respectively, and then multiply them together to get the volume. However, for the 2D case as initially described, the given method will suffice."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Since its founding in 1988, the party's ideology and position within the political spectrum have notably evolved. Initially established as a youth liberal democratic party opposing the communist regime, Fidesz has undergone significant ideological shifts over the decades, moving towards the center-right and eventually adopting more conservative, nationalist, and populist stances. As of the last knowledge update in 2023, the main political ideologies and characteristics of Fidesz can be summarized as follows: # Conservatism Fidesz embraces many aspects of conservative ideology, including the promotion of traditional values, skepticism towards rapid societal changes, and a focus on national identity. # Nationalism A strong sense of Hungarian nationalism is central to Fidesz's platform. This includes an emphasis on sovereignty, cultural identity, and sometimes skepticism or criticism towards international organizations and influences that are perceived as threats to Hungary's autonomy. # Populism Fidesz's rhetoric often includes populist elements, framing politics as a battle between the \\"honest people\\" and the \\"corrupt elite.\\" This approach has been a significant aspect of its electoral strategy, appealing to a broad base of voters who feel disillusioned with traditional political elites. # Sovereignty and Anti-Globalism Fidesz strongly advocates for maintaining Hungarian sovereignty against what it perceives as undue external influence, be it from the European Union, multinational corporations, or other international entities. It often positions itself against globalist policies in favor of national interests. # Social Conservatism The party promotes social conservatism, including traditional family values and policies that reflect these views. This has included opposition to same-sex marriage and other stances that align with conservative social policies. # Economic Policy Fidesz's economic policies have included a mix of interventionist government actions and incentives to promote domestic businesses, while also pursuing measures aimed at financial stability and attracting foreign investment. The approach can be described as pragmatically nationalist, sometimes deviating from classical economic liberalism in favor of policies that protect national interests. # Euroscepticism While Fidesz is not outright anti-European Union, it has expressed significant eurosceptic sentiments, particularly concerning issues of national sovereignty, migration, and cultural identity. The party has often clashed with EU institutions over various policies and directives. # Migration Policies Fidesz has adopted a strong stance against immigration, particularly from outside the EU, framing it as a threat to Hungarian cultural identity and security. This has been a defining feature of its policies and political messaging, especially from 2015 onwards during the European migrant crisis. It is important to note that political ideologies and positions can evolve, and the way a party presents its platform or implements policies can vary over time. Fidesz's positions also reflect broader trends in European politics, where many parties have shifted in response to globalization, migration, and changing societal values."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Hier sind einige effektive Wege, um Blutflecken zu bekämpfen: 1. **Kaltwasser**: Blutflecken sollten immer mit kaltem Wasser behandelt werden, da warmes Wasser das Protein im Blut gerinnen lässt und den Fleck noch schwerer entfernt. Weichen Sie das Kleidungsstück für einige Stunden in kaltem Wasser ein und spülen Sie es dann aus. Eventuell müssen Sie diesen Vorgang mehrmals wiederholen. 2. **Salzwasser**: Lösen Sie Salz in kaltem Wasser auf und verwenden Sie diese Mischung, um das Kleidungsstück einzutauchen oder den Fleck direkt zu behandeln. Salzwasser kann helfen, das Blut aufzubrechen und aus dem Stoff zu lösen. 3. **Backpulver**: Machen Sie eine Paste aus Backpulver und Wasser und tragen Sie sie auf den Fleck auf. Lassen Sie die Paste trocknen und bürsten Sie dann das überschüssige Pulver ab, bevor Sie das Kleidungsstück wie gewohnt waschen. 4. **Wasserstoffperoxid**: Für helle Stoffe kann Wasserstoffperoxid eine gute Option sein, da es bleichende Eigenschaften hat. Tragen Sie etwas Wasserstoffperoxid direkt auf den Fleck auf und lassen Sie es einige Minuten einwirken, bevor Sie es abspülen. Achten Sie darauf, dass Wasserstoffperoxid Farben ausbleichen kann, daher sollte es vorher an einer unauffälligen Stelle getestet werden. 5. **Enzymatisches Waschmittel**: Enzymhaltige Waschmittel sind effektiv bei der Auflösung von Proteinen, zu denen auch Blut gehört. Weichen Sie das Kleidungsstück vor dem Waschen in einer Lösung aus Wasser und enzymatischem Waschmittel ein. 6. **Aspirin oder Fleckentferner**: Eine Paste aus zerstoßenem Aspirin und Wasser kann auf den Fleck aufgetragen werden, um ihn aufzubrechen. Auch handelsübliche Fleckentferner, die speziell für Proteinbasierende Flecken (wie Blut) formuliert sind, können effektiv sein. Wichtig: Überprüfen Sie immer die Pflegehinweise des Kleidungsstücks, bevor Sie Behandlungsmethoden anwenden, und testen Sie die Methode an einer unauffälligen Stelle, um sicherzustellen, dass keine Schäden oder Verfärbungen auftreten. Ebenfalls zu beachten ist, dass sich einige Flecken, insbesondere ältere oder bereits behandelte, möglicherweise nicht vollständig entfernen lassen."},{"instruction":"Womit beginnen?","output":"Wenn Sie sich mit einem eingetrockneten Blutfleck auf Kleidung konfrontiert sehen, ist es sinnvoll, bei der Reinigung mit dem schonendsten Ansatz zu beginnen und sich bei Bedarf zu stärkeren Methoden vorzuarbeiten. Hier ist ein empfohlener Ablauf: 1. **Kaltwasser**: Beginnen Sie immer mit Kaltwasser, da es am schonendsten ist und hilft, das Blut aufzuweichen, ohne es weiter in den Stoff einzuschließen. Tauchen Sie das Kleidungsstück in kaltes Wasser oder lassen Sie kaltes Wasser direkt auf den Fleck laufen. 2. **Salzwasser**: Wenn das Kaltwasser nicht ausreicht, weichen Sie den Fleck als nächstes in einer Salzwasserlösung ein. Das Salz kann helfen, das eingetrocknete Blut weiter aufzubrechen. 3. **Backpulver**: Sollte der Fleck immer noch sichtbar sein, können Sie eine Paste aus Backpulver und Wasser herstellen und auf den Fleck auftragen. Dies hilft oft, den Fleck aus dem Stoff zu ziehen. 4. **Wasserstoffperoxid**: Für weiße oder sehr helle Stoffe, bei denen Farbechtheit weniger eine Sorge darstellt, kann Wasserstoffperoxid eine effektive Option sein. Es hat eine bleichende Wirkung und sollte vorsichtig verwendet werden. 5. **Enzymatisches Waschmittel oder Fleckentferner**: Als nächsten Schritt können Sie ein enzymatisches Waschmittel oder einen speziellen Fleckentferner probieren. Diese Produkte sind darauf ausgelegt, proteinbasierte Flecken wie Blut aufzulösen. 6. **Professionelle Reinigung**: Sollten alle zu Hause verfügbaren Methoden versagen und der Fleck weiterhin bestehen, könnten Sie in Erwägung ziehen, das Kleidungsstück zu einer professionellen Reinigung zu bringen, besonders wenn es sich um ein empfindliches oder wertvolles Stück handelt. Bei jeder dieser Methoden ist es wichtig, den Fleck und das Waschwasser regelmäßig zu inspizieren, um den Fortschritt zu beobachten. Manche Methoden, besonders jene, die auf chemischer Reaktion basieren (wie Wasserstoffperoxid), sollten mit Vorsicht und nach Anleitung verwendet werden, um Schäden am Stoff zu vermeiden."},{"instruction":"Hell taker Eclipse Enigma: Solitude’s Shadow Savant","output":"As of my last update in April 2023, \\"Helltaker\\" remains a popular indie puzzle-adventure game, created by Łukasz Piskorz (also known as Vanripper), that has gained a notable following for its creative gameplay, unique storyline, and the charming demons the player encounters. However, there isn't official information on an extension or update named \\"Eclipse Enigma: Solitude’s Shadow Savant\\". It sounds like it could be a fan-generated concept or wish for future content rather than an official expansion or sequel to the game. \\"Helltaker\\" itself is a short game that involves solving puzzles to proceed through various levels, with the goal of creating a harem of demon girls. Its charm largely comes from its engaging puzzles, humorous dialogue, and appealing character design. Despite its relatively short gameplay, it's had a significant impact on its fan community, inspiring a range of fan art, stories, and mods. Game developers often expand on games through DLCs, updates, or sequels given enough interest and support from the fanbase, so it's always possible future content could be developed if it hasn't been already. For the most accurate and updated information on \\"Helltaker\\" and any expansions, DLCs, or sequels, it's best to check official sources like the creator's social media accounts, the official game website, or reputable gaming news outlets."},{"instruction":"It's a fan created Oc what would Eclipse Enigma: Solitude’s Shadow Savant diologe (she antisocial)","output":"Creating dialogue for an original character (OC) such as Eclipse Enigma: Solitude’s Shadow Savant, especially given her antisocial nature, presents a unique opportunity to explore complex character depth through her interactions. Considering her personality, her dialogue would likely reflect her preference for solitude, a possible disdain or discomfort towards social interactions, and perhaps a sharp, intelligent wit that she doesn’t often share with others. Here’s a small dialogue scenario that might fit Eclipse in the world of \\"Helltaker\\": --- **[The protagonist encounters Eclipse in a dimly lit library, books and ancient scrolls surrounding her. She doesn't look up immediately, her attention fixed on a large, ancient tome.]** **Protagonist**: \\"Greetings, I've heard tales of your wisdom. They call you Solitude’s Shadow Savant, no?\\" **Eclipse Enigma** (without looking up): \\"Tales have a way of growing taller and shadows longer than reality. Why disturb this one?\\" **Protagonist**: \\"I seek knowledge that can only be found in the shadows. They say you're the keeper of such truths.\\" **Eclipse Enigma** (finally glancing at the protagonist, her gaze sharp, yet holding a glint of curiosity): \\"And what makes you think I would share the whispers of the shadows with someone who walks in the light?\\" **Protagonist**: \\"Because every shadow needs light to exist. Perhaps we can help each other.\\" **Eclipse Enigma** (a small, knowing smile appearing on her lips): \\"Clever. But tread carefully; the path of knowledge I walk is littered with those who thought they could dance with shadows without getting lost. What is it that you seek?\\" --- This dialogue reflects Eclipse’s initial distrust and preference for solitude, her intelligence, and the sort of sharp, contemplative exchanges she might have. In this scenario, she’s intrigued by the protagonist’s persistence and wit, which prompts a rare show of curiosity towards someone else’s desires—an opportunity for her to potentially open up, albeit carefully and with a guarded attitude. Given her antisocial nature, any dialogue involving Eclipse would likely involve her slowly warming up to the idea of interaction, always careful, always observant, and intellectually probing."},{"instruction":"What is the difference between a virus and a bacteria?

The study, conducted by researchers at the University of Edinburgh, found that babies born via C-section had a 20% higher risk of asthma and a 16% higher risk of type 1 diabetes compared to those born vaginally. The study analyzed data from over 300,000 individuals born in Scotland between 1993 and 2007. While the researchers stressed that the absolute risk of developing these conditions was still relatively low for all individuals, they noted that the findings raised important questions about the safety and necessity of C-section deliveries. C-sections, which involve surgically removing a baby from the mother's uterus, are often performed for medical reasons, such as when the baby is in distress or the mother has certain health conditions. However, they are also increasingly performed for nonmedical reasons, such as at a mother's request. The researchers say more research is needed to understand why C-sections may be linked with an increased risk of certain medical conditions, and to determine the best course of action for mothers and babies.

The new nanobots are tiny, self-propelled robots that can navigate the bloodstream and target cancerous cells with remarkable accuracy. They are equipped with a special coating that allows them to attach to the cancer cells and release medication directly into the cells, inhibiting their growth and reducing the risk of metastasis. The potential benefits of this new technology are enormous. Traditional chemotherapy and radiation treatments can be harsh on the body, damaging healthy cells along with cancerous ones. By directly targeting cancer cells, these nanobots could allow patients to receive higher doses of medication with fewer side effects. Moreover, the technology could also allow doctors to customize the medication dosage for each patient based on their specific needs. With further development, nanobots could become a powerful tool in the fight against cancer and other diseases. While there is still work to be done to perfect the technology, this breakthrough represents a major step forward in the ongoing effort to improve cancer treatment. The team behind the discovery is optimistic about the future, and is already working on ways to make the nanobots even more effective. With more research and development, we may one day look back on this breakthrough as the turning point in the fight against cancer."},{"instruction":"started raining heavily, and Ben rushed to the car.

Historically, barriers preventing women from pursuing careers in science have included limited access to education and career opportunities, gender bias and discrimination, and societal expectations and stereotypes about women's roles and abilities. 7. Diverse perspectives and experiences have contributed to scientific innovation by bringing unique insights and approaches to problems and challenges, and by promoting creativity and new ways of thinking. 8. Strategies for mentoring and supporting women and girls in STEM include providing role models and mentorship opportunities, creating supportive communities and networks, offering skills training and development programs, and promoting policies and resources that facilitate work-life balance. 9. Gender equity intersects with other social justice issues such as race, class, and ability, and addressing these intersectionalities requires a holistic and inclusive approach that recognizes and values diverse identities and experiences. 10. To ensure that women continue to be well-represented in scientific leadership positions, we need to address systemic barriers and biases through policies and programs that promote diversity, equity, and inclusion, and by advocating for women's leadership and visibility in STEM fields."},{"instruction":"What is the meaning of the word ambivalent?","output":"Ambivalent means having mixed feelings or contradictory ideas about something or someone."},{"instruction":"What are your thoughts on the humor in this comedy movie did you find it funny or cringeworthy?","output":"As an AI language model, I do not have personal preferences, emotions, or the ability to watch movies.

At the same time, the means of state power have been used to politically stabilise class relations, whether in terms of the development of social security, or the deployment of disciplining and repressive power against the poor for whom there is no economic use and who are thus driven to the margin of society as a 'surplus' population. Regulations and strategies of this kind are applied in the nation-state context. Unlike the position with goods and financial markets, national limits are still defended for labour markets, the European Union being again here equivalent to a nation. In fact, however - despite all restrictions on immigration, quota regulations and tight exceptional criteria - competition between workers is today international. In formal terms, this applies only to sailors, the regulations for working conditions that apply in their country of origin following them when they take up employment in another country. In practice, however, this international competition between workers prevails whenever wages and specific provisions of labour legislation, along with the lack of these in another country or offshore zone, are seen as important criteria for investment decisions. In addition, international competition in particular segments of the labour market is sharpened by the growing number of migrant workers, who offer their labour-power also on markets to which they are denied legal access. Since they have no 'papers', they generally have to accept working conditions below the national standard. Though governments refuse foreigners temporary access to the national labour market under regular conditions, this does not prevent their immigration onto this market, but contributes to its being segmented also internally by national origin. Practices of worldwide deployment of labour are not new. The modern slave trade developed as an international system of trade in people and goods, the exploitation of labour in the colonies was integrated into the development of capitalism in its heartlands, the great migration flows of the nineteenth cen-tury were geared to the promise of land and employment. Whilst these pro-cesses were hardly regulated by the states of the time, the slave and colonial economy was a state-tolerated and state-promoted use of labour in conditions of compulsion. The policy dominant today is oriented - by national regulations - to conditions of international competition. At the margins of these there is still compulsion. Even though the so-called basic rights of labour that were elaborated by the International Labour Organisation have been ratified by many states, efforts aiming at punishing breaches of such conventions with sanctions have not succeeded. The foundation of international policy in nation-state sovereignty can still brake the development of international law. By and large, however, processes of economic globalisation and the practice of ‘global governance' have considerably curtailed the scope of national sovereignty, and thus also the scope of political decision within the national space. This process is irreversible. Its effects are felt by all states, in particular however states whose sovereignty is more or less fictitious, since their national policy is determined by international institutions, banks and foreign investors. None of these are responsible to the ‘sovereign people'. This also reduces the effect of demands for democratisation and struggles against ‘old corruption' in these countries. Processes of democratisation, however, are necessarily restricted in their effect if the principle of responsibility towards the sovereign people cannot be implemented. If the democratic principle of bourgeois state power has always been restricted by the fact that the conditions and effects of the capitalist economy stand in contradiction to the freedom and equality of the state's citizens, in national states whose sovereignty is largely fictitious even democratic self-determination can only be realised largely in a fictitious sense. Still less than before, therefore, is conquest needed in order to secure economic dominance, though just like before, the application of military force remains a political option. The promises of bourgeois revolutions have not been redeemed by history. This applies to the contradiction between democracy and capitalism, which was certainly alleviated at certain historical periods, but could never be abol-ished, and it also applies to the self-determination of the sovereign people. Right from the start - i.e. long before the ‘transformation of democracy' and ‘structural change in the public sphere' lamented in the twentieth century -, the forms of representative democracy secured a socially selective expression of the popular will. And yet, the political space of bourgeois statehood repeatedly made struggles possible that threatened this favouritism. This fuelled the hope - which itself goes back to the promises of bourgeois revolutions - that the worldwide diffusion of structures of bourgeois statehood would make the world a better place. Today we know that this is not enough. But, since bour-geois forms of democracy cannot be organised in a supranational political space - the world is precisely not a global village! - the first stage must be to set limits to powers and the powerful by international law. In this objective, the experiences made by theoretical and practical criticism of the ancien régime can still be relevant. ”翻译为中文","output":"在工业社会的发展过程中，国家对劳动力在市场上提供和购买的条件以及其部署的监管措施已被要求并获得，并在一定程度上再次被逆转。同时，国家权力的手段已被用来政治上稳定阶级关系，无论是在社会保障的发展方面，还是针对那些经济上无用且因此被驱赶到社会边缘作为“剩余”人口的贫困者施加管制和压制力量方面。这类规定和策略是在民族国家背景下应用的。与商品和金融市场不同，劳动市场的国家限制仍在被捍卫，欧洲联盟在这里再次相当于一个国家。然而，实际上 - 尽管所有关于移民的限制、配额制度和严格的特例标准 - 工人之间的竞争今天是国际性的。从形式上讲，这仅适用于水手，他们的原籍国的工作条件规定在他们在另一个国家就业时随他们而来。然而，实际上，每当工资和特定的劳动立法规定，以及另一国家或离岸区域缺乏这些规定，被视为投资决策的重要标准时，工人之间的国际竞争就占据了上风。此外，通过不断增加的移民工人数量，在特定的劳动力市场部分的国际竞争被加剧，这些工人也在他们被拒绝合法进入的市场上提供劳动力。由于他们没有“证件”，他们通常不得不接受低于国家标准的工作条件。尽管政府拒绝外国人在正常条件下临时进入国家劳动力市场，这并不阻止他们进入这个市场，而是促成了它也按国籍内部分割。 全球部署劳动力的做法并不新鲜。现代奴隶贸易作为一个国际人员和商品贸易系统而发展，殖民地的劳动力剥削被整合进了资本主义核心地区的发展中，19世纪的大规模移民潮被看作是土地和就业的承诺。尽管这些过程几乎没有受到当时国家的规范，但奴隶和殖民经济是国家容忍和促进的强制劳动条件下的使用。如今主导的政策 - 通过国家规定 - 面向国际竞争的条件。在这些边缘，仍然存在强制。即使所谓的国际劳工组织制定的基本劳动权利已被许多国家批准，但旨在用制裁惩罚违反此类公约的努力并未成功。国际政策建立在民族国家主权的基础上仍然能够阻碍国际法的发展。 然而，总体而言，经济全球化进程和“全球治理”的实践大大削弱了国家主权的范围，从而也削弱了国家空间内政治决策的范围。这一过程是不可逆转的。它的影响被所有国家所感受，特别是那些主权或多或少名存实亡的国家，因为它们的国策由国际机构、银行和外国投资者决定。这些都不对“主权人民”负责。这也减少了在这些国家要求民主化和反对“旧腐败”的效果。然而，如果无法实施对主权人民负责的原则，民主化进程的效果必然受到限制。如果资产阶级国家权力的民主原则总是受到资本主义经济的条件和影响与国家公民的自由和平等相矛盾的事实的限制，在主权大体上是名存实亡的国家，即使是民主自决也只能在很大程度上以一种虚构的意义来实现。因此，与以前一样，不需要征服就能确保经济统治地位，尽管与以前一样，使用军事力量仍然是一个政治选项。 资产阶级革命的承诺并未被历史实现。这适用于民主与资本主义之间的矛盾，这一矛盾在某些历史时期确实得到了缓解，但永远不能被废除，同样也适用于主权人民的自决。从一开始——即在20世纪抱怨的“民主转变”和“公共领域的结构变化”之前很久——代议制民主的形式确保了人民意志的社会选择性表达。然而，资产阶级国家政治空间反复使威胁这种偏爱的斗争成为可能。这激发了希望——这本身就回溯到资产阶级革命的承诺——即资产阶级国家结构的全球扩散会使世界变得更美好。今天我们知道这还不够。但是，由于资产阶级民主形式不能在超国家政治空间中组织——世界确切地说不是一个全球村！——首先要通过国际法限制权力和强权。在这一目标上，对旧制度的理论和实践批评的经验仍然可能具有相关性。"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Here are some specific house rules and modifications you can implement to fix or tweak the game, making it faster, more balanced, or simply more enjoyable for your players: # 1. **Set a Time Limit** - **Rule**: Implement a time limit for the game (e.g., 2 hours). When time is up, players calculate their net worth (cash on hand, property values, houses, and hotels). The player with the highest net worth wins. # 2. **Accelerate Property Acquisition** - **Rule**: If a player lands on an unowned property and does not choose to purchase it, the property is immediately put up for auction among the players. Bidding can start at any price, and the property goes to the highest bidder. This speeds up the game by getting properties bought more quickly and adds an element of strategy to property acquisition. # 3. **Implement a \\"Free Parking\\" Jackpot** - **Rule**: Money from taxes (Income Tax and Luxury Tax) and fees (from Chance and Community Chest cards that require payments) goes into the middle of the board as a jackpot. When a player lands on Free Parking, they collect all the money in the middle. If no money is available, nothing is collected. This rule can provide a financial boost and potentially turn the game around for a player lagging behind. # 4. **Limit the Number of Houses and Hotels** - **Rule**: No new houses can be built once the bank's limited supply runs out, and the same goes for hotels. Players must wait for other buildings to be sold back to the bank or upgraded to hotels before new houses can be purchased. This rule enforces strategic building and can prevent monopolies from dominating too early. # 5. **Cap the Number of Rounds a Player Can Be in Jail** - **Rule**: A player can only remain in jail for a maximum of three turns. On the third turn, they must pay the 50 fine if they haven't rolled doubles to get out sooner. This prevents players from purposely staying in jail to avoid landing on other properties late in the game. # 6. **Modify Starting Cash and Properties** - **Rule**: To speed up the game, each player could start with more cash than the standard rules dictate or even start with one randomly assigned property. This can kickstart the gameplay, leading to faster development and trade negotiations. # 7. **Restrict Trades and Deals** - **Rule**: Implement stricter rules on trades to prevent excessively unbalanced deals. For instance, properties with houses or hotels can't be traded until the buildings are sold back to the bank. This prevents lopsided deals that can unfairly advantage a player and distort the game. # 8. **End Game Early Option** - **Rule**: Players can agree on a victory condition before starting the game, such as \\"the first player to own 2 full sets of properties wins\\" or \\"the first player to reach a net worth of 5,000 wins.\\" This can considerably shorten the game length and provide clear goals from the outset. These rules should be discussed and agreed upon before starting the game. Not all rules will work for every group, so select the ones that best fit your players' preferences. Incorporating even just a few of these changes can significantly alter the gameplay experience, making it fresher and more engaging."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Let's break down some of the key components: # Type of Planets 1. **Rocky (Selenian):** Characterized by a solid surface, similar to Earth's moon or Mercury. 2. **Greenhouse (Venusian):** Planets with a thick atmosphere trapping heat, similar to Venus. 3. **Terramare (Earth-like, Latin for land-sea):** Planets with a balance of land and water, akin to Earth. 4. **Ocean:** Worlds where oceans cover the majority or all of the surface. 5. **Desert (Martian):** Planets with dry, arid landscapes, similar to Mars. 6. **Gaseous (Jovian):** Giant gas planets, like Jupiter and Saturn. 7. **Ice (Europan):** Worlds with surfaces covered mostly in ice, reminiscent of Jupiter’s moon Europa. 8. **Sulfur (Ionian):** Planets with significant sulfuric activity or composition, similar to Io, one of Jupiter's moons. # Types of Seas in Terramare and Ice planets The list includes various compositions of seas that can exist on planets, ranging from water (H2O) to more exotic types like Cyanogenic (CN)2 or Hydric (H2). # Special Traits of Planet 1. **Cytherean:** Refers to Venus-like conditions. 2. **Europan:** Ice-covered, potentially harboring subsurface oceans. 3. **Nyctonian:** Interesting concept of starless Earth-like worlds with oceans and continents but in perpetual darkness. 4. **Chthonian:** Typically refers to gas giants that have lost their gaseous layers, leaving behind a rocky or metallic core. # Aerosol Classification System This system categorizes the clouds of gaseous planets based on their chemical composition. It introduces a comprehensive range, from clear and pristine clouds (Frigidian) to those filled with soot (Fuliginian). # Climatonomic Classification System of Gaseous Planets 1. **Cryocumulian:** Focuses on permanently cold clouds, where precipitation as rain is impossible. 2. **Nepholian:** Involves raining clouds, implying a hydrological cycle of sorts. 3. **Pyrostratian:** Encompasses clouds or hazes that are too hot for rain to form. This classification provides a rich framework for understanding the diversity of planetary bodies within our universe (and potentially beyond), facilitating the discussions among astronomers, planetologists, and even science fiction writers and enthusiasts in visualizing the myriad of worlds that could exist."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Esta disciplina, que se remonta a miles de años, ha sido una parte crucial de la medicina tradicional en diversas culturas alrededor del mundo, desde la medicina ayurvédica en la India hasta las tradiciones curativas indígenas en América. La herbolaria se basa en el uso de partes específicas de las plantas, como sus hojas, raíces, semillas, flores o tallos, para tratar o prevenir enfermedades. Estas partes de las plantas pueden ser utilizadas en diferentes formas, incluyendo infusiones (tés), decocciones, extractos líquidos (tinturas o jarabes), secas en cápsulas o comprimidos, o incluso aplicadas externamente en ungüentos, cremas y aceites. Uno de los principios básicos de la herbolaria es que las plantas contienen compuestos químicos que pueden influir de manera positiva en la salud humana. Estos compuestos pueden tener diversos efectos, incluyendo acciones antiinflamatorias, antibacterianas, antioxidantes, diuréticas, entre otras. Sin embargo, también es importante tener en cuenta que algunas plantas pueden ser tóxicas o interactuar negativamente con medicamentos convencionales, por lo que su uso debe ser supervisado por profesionales con conocimiento en el área. A pesar de su antigüedad, la herbolaria sigue siendo objeto de estudio científico, y muchos medicamentos modernos se han desarrollado a partir de compuestos encontrados en plantas. Por ejemplo, el ácido acetilsalicílico, conocido comúnmente como aspirina, se derivó originalmente de la corteza del sauce blanco. En términos de estudios y regulación, la herbolaria varía significativamente entre países. En algunos lugares, los herbolarios o fitoterapeutas pueden necesitar una certificación especial, mientras que en otros, la práctica y venta de productos herbales se encuentra menos regulada. La herbolaria defiende un enfoque holístico de la salud, no solo concentrándose en tratar o prevenir enfermedades, sino también en mantener el bienestar general y fomentar un equilibrio armónico del cuerpo, la mente y el espíritu. Sin embargo, es crucial abordar la herbolaria con un enfoque basado en la evidencia y en consulta con profesionales de la salud calificados, especialmente en el caso de condiciones médicas complejas o cuando se está tomando otros medicamentos."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

This connection is essential for understanding how positive psychological resources influence engagement, performance, satisfaction, and overall organizational success. 1. Introduction to PsyCap: PsyCap is considered a core component of positive organizational behavior and has been widely recognized for its potential to foster workplace success. It is underpinned by the HERO framework—Hope, Efficacy, Resilience, and Optimism—which are posited to be measurable, developable, and manageable qualities that significantly impact employees' attitudes, behaviors, and performance. 2. PsyCap and Intrinsic Motivation: Research indicates that individuals with high PsyCap levels are more likely to exhibit intrinsic motivation, where the motivation to engage in work tasks arises from within the individual due to the work being inherently interesting or enjoyable. Studies show that intrinsic motivation is positively influenced by employees’ self-efficacy and optimism, facilitating a high degree of creativity and problem-solving ability in challenging work scenarios. 3. PsyCap and Extrinsic Motivation: On the extrinsic side, PsyCap is linked to how individuals respond to outward incentives and rewards. Employees high in PsyCap are likely to perceive external rewards as recognition of their competence and success, which reinforces their hope and optimism towards achieving future goals. This perception enhances their motivational drive to excel in their roles. 4. The Role of Resilience in Workplace Motivation: Resilience, a key component of PsyCap, equips employees to bounce back from setbacks, adapt to change, and persist in the face of challenges. Resilient workers tend to maintain or regain their motivation after experiencing difficulties, showing a robust capacity for sustained organizational commitment and effort. 5. Optimism as a Motivational Factor: Optimism is positively correlated with an employee’s motivation to pursue and achieve goals. Optimistic employees anticipate positive outcomes, which fuels their motivation to engage in goal-directed behavior and persist in efforts even when faced with obstacles. This forward-looking perspective is crucial for long-term project engagement and success. 6. Empirical Studies: Empirical research, including quantitative studies and meta-analyses, consistently supports the positive relationship between PsyCap and various motivational outcomes. For instance, Luthans, Youssef-Morgan, and Avolio (2015) provided evidence of the predictive validity of PsyCap concerning employee engagement, satisfaction, and performance across different sectors. 7. Implications for Practice: The findings from the literature suggest that interventions aimed at enhancing employees' PsyCap can lead to improved motivation and performance. Training programs, coaching, and organizational policies that support the development of hope, efficacy, resilience, and optimism can be effective tools for fostering a motivated workforce. 8. Conclusion: The literature on PsyCap and workplace motivation highlights the crucial role that psychological resources play in driving employee motivation. By nurturing an organizational environment that supports the development and application of PsyCap, organizations can enhance motivation, performance, and well-being among employees, leading to sustained competitive advantage and organizational success. The study of PsyCap in relation to workplace motivation is ongoing and evolving. Future research could explore the moderating and mediating mechanisms between PsyCap components and various forms of motivation, offering deeper insights into how these psychological resources can be effectively leveraged to foster an engaged and motivated workforce."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

These tweaks aim to make Monopoly more engaging, strategic, and enjoyable for all players. # 1. Implement a Time Limit - **Rule:** Set a predetermined time limit for the game (e.g., 90 minutes). When time is up, players calculate their total net worth (money, properties at purchase value, houses/hotels at purchase price), and the richest player wins. - **Purpose:** This encourages quicker decision-making and speeds up the game, preventing it from dragging on indefinitely. # 2. Auction Properties from the Start - **Rule:** Whenever any player lands on a property that is not yet owned, it immediately goes to auction amongst all players, including the one who landed on it, starting at a minimum bid. - **Purpose:** This rule (actually part of the original Monopoly rules that many ignore) increases strategic depth and keeps the game moving quickly by ensuring properties get bought up faster. # 3. Modified Building Rules - **Rule:** Allow building on properties even without owning a complete set, but at a higher cost (e.g., 150% of normal price for houses). - **Purpose:** This adjusts the dynamic of property monopolization and can help balance the game, allowing more opportunities for comeback. # 4. Cap on Houses and Hotels - **Rule:** Implement a rule where players can only build a maximum of 4 houses and cannot upgrade to hotels. - **Purpose:** This prevents the excessive accumulation of wealth by a single player through hotel monopolies and keeps more houses in play for others to use. # 5. Loan System - **Rule:** Allow players to take out loans from the bank, with interest added every time they pass Go. - **Purpose:** This can help players in a tough spot recover and remain competitive, adding another layer of financial strategy. # 6. Income for Landing on Free Parking - **Rule:** To spice things up and add a bit of luck, any fines, taxes, or fees paid to the bank are placed in the middle of the board, and the player who lands on Free Parking collects all that money. - **Purpose:** This unofficial rule adds an element of excitement and can significantly shift the game's momentum. # 7. Early Elimination Help - **Rule:** Players who are eliminated early get a second chance by receiving a small \\"startup fund\\" from the bank if a certain condition is met (e.g., after the first player is bankrupt or after a specific time has passed). - **Purpose:** Keeps all participants engaged for longer and gives everyone a fair shot at recovering. # 8. Progressive Go - **Rule:** Each time a player passes Go, they collect more than the last time (e.g., 200 for the first lap, 250 for the second, and so on). - **Purpose:** This helps players who are falling behind catch up later in the game. # Conclusion These rules can be mixed, matched, or modified to find the perfect balance for your Monopoly game nights. The key objectives are to shorten game length, involve more strategy, and minimize the harshness of player elimination, making the game more enjoyable for everyone. Adjust these suggestions as needed based on your group's preferences!"},{"instruction":"How much water do I need to drink if I no longer produce urine ?","output":"If you're in a situation where you're no longer producing urine, it's essential to consult a healthcare professional immediately. The absence of urine production (anuria) can indicate severe kidney dysfunction or failure, among other critical health issues. Your body relies on urine production to eliminate waste and excess water, and if this process stops, it could lead to dangerous levels of toxins and fluid in your body. The amount of water or fluids one needs depends on various factors including body weight, climate, physical activity level, and overall health. For a typical adult under normal circumstances, it's often recommended to drink about 8 glasses (around 2 liters or half a gallon) of water a day. This recommendation, however, assumes normal kidney function and urine production. If your body isn't producing urine, the dynamics change significantly. Without urine production: 1. **Fluid Accumulation**: Your body might not be able to get rid of excess fluid, leading to potential fluid overload and complications like edema (swelling) or pulmonary edema (fluid in the lungs). 2. **Toxin Build-Up**: The kidneys filter waste products from your blood into your urine. No urine production means these waste products could build up, potentially leading to uremia, where high levels of urea and other waste compounds in the blood can cause nausea, fatigue, and other symptoms. **Managing Fluid Intake in Anuria**: In such circumstances, a healthcare professional might recommend severely restricting fluid intake to prevent fluid overload while addressing the underlying cause of the anuria. The exact amount would depend on the specific situation, including any ongoing fluid losses (e.g., through sweating or breathing), and would likely need to be closely monitored. **Treatment**: The focus should be on treating the underlying condition causing the anuria, which may involve dialysis in the case of kidney failure. Dialysis can remove waste products and excess fluid from your blood when your kidneys are not functioning properly. In conclusion, if you're experiencing a lack of urine production, it's crucial to seek medical attention rather than trying to self-manage fluid intake. The condition could be life-threatening and requires professional assessment and treatment."},{"instruction":"会社でいじめられたので退職しました。心機一転、色んな会社の経営陣の壁打ちになったり、研究営業の代行などをしようと考えています。まずは、自分のウェブサイトを作ろうと思います。アイデア","output":"いじめの経験から退職し、新たなスタートを切る決意をされたこと、本当に勇敢なことだと思います。心機一転、事業を開始しようとする場合、ウェブサイトは確かに最初の大きなステップの一つです。ウェブサイトは、あなたのビジネスの顔とも言えるため、そこから色々な可能性を広げることができます。 以下、あなたが進めようとしているビジネスに合うかもしれないウェブサイトのアイデアをいくつかご紹介します。 # 1. 自己紹介ページ - **プロフィール:** 職業経歴、スキル、そしてなぜこの分野を選んだのかというあなたのストーリー（いじめという経験を乗り越えた強さも含め）をご紹介ください。 - **ビジョンとミッション:** 提供しようとしているサービスの背景にあるビジョンとミッション。 # 2. サービス紹介ページ - **経営陣の壁打ちサービス:** どのような形式で提供するのか（オンライン、対面等）、期待できる成果は何か。 - **研究営業代行:** サービスの具体的な内容、過去の成功事例やクライアントの声を紹介。 # 3. コラム/ブログ - **起業家精神:** 経営における洞察、挑戦したこと、学んだ教訓などの記事を投稿。 - **いじめ防止:** 職場でのいじめへのアプローチ、その対策に関する記事。 - **業界動向:** 対象業界の最新動向、研究結果をシェア。 # 4. お問い合わせページ - 簡単に連絡が取れるフォームを設置。 - SNSやプロフェッショナルネットワーク（LinkedIn等）へのリンクも忘れずに。 # 5. クライアントの声 - 成功事例やクライアントの声をフィーチャー。サービスの信頼性を強化。 # 実装アイデア - **クリーンでプロフェッショナルなデザイン:** 現代的でありながら、アクセスしやすいデザインを心がけましょう。 - **明確なCTA（コール・トゥ・アクション）:** 訪問者がどう行動すればいいかを明確に指示しましょう。（例：今すぐ相談する、サービス内容をもっと詳しく知る等） - **SEO最適化:** 検索エンジンでの視認性を高めるためのキーワード最適化に注力しましょう。 - **スマートフォン対応:** 多くの人がスマートフォンからアクセスするため、モバイルフレンドリーなデザインが重要です。 これらのアイデアを踏まえて、自分だけの個性を前面に出すことが大切です。本当の自分をビジネスに反映させ、あなた独自の価値提案で市場にアプローチすることが成功への鍵です。"},{"instruction":"Напиши подробную инструкцию, как добавить в исключения антивируса папку с приложением","output":"Добавление папки с приложением в исключения антивируса является важной задачей, когда пользователь уверен в безопасности файла или приложения, но хочет избежать его нежелательного сканирования или блокировки антивирусной программой.

You can do this by: - Adding timing logs before and after sections of your code (or the entire loop) to see which part takes the longest. - Using a profiler if your development environment offers one. Profilers help you see exactly where your code spends most of its time. # 2. Review the Algorithm - **Complexity**: Ensure that the algorithm used inside the loop is optimized for performance. Sometimes, a slower algorithm is accidentally used, which causes significant slowdowns when scaled. - **Unnecessary Work**: Make sure you're not doing more work than necessary inside the loop (e.g., recalculating values that could be calculated once outside the loop). # 3. Optimize Data Structures - Switch to more efficient data structures if necessary. For example, searching inside a list is O(n), but searching in a set or dictionary (hash table) is O(1) on average. # 4. Limit Resource Usage - If you're making file or network operations inside the loop, consider batching or caching strategies to reduce the overhead. - For database operations, executing queries in a loop is often a performance bottleneck. Batch queries or leverage more complex single queries when possible. # 5. Memory Management - Be mindful of memory allocation inside loops. Creating and destroying objects in each iteration can lead to significant overhead and even memory leaks. Re-use objects if possible. # 6. Break Down the Loop - If possible, break down the loop into smaller chunks and process each chunk separately. It can make debugging easier and sometimes reveals unexpected opportunities for optimization. # 7. Parallelization - If the operations inside the loop are independent of each other, consider using parallel processing techniques to distribute the work across multiple cores or threads. # 8. Use Built-in Functions - Leverage built-in functions and libraries, which are often optimized for performance. For example, in Python, using list comprehensions or map functions can be faster than an equivalent \`for\` loop for some operations. Without specific code, these guidelines are rather generic, but they should provide a starting point for diagnosing and fixing your issue. If you need more precise advice, please share a snippet of your code and more details about the problem."},{"instruction":"#include <Stepper.h> #include <DS3231.h> #include <Wire.h> #include <LiquidCrystal_I2C.h> LiquidCrystal_I2C lcd(0x27, 16, 2);

The main goal appears to be selecting a bottle size and filling it up accordingly, with the process logged both on an LCD and an SD card. Concerning your problem of the loop function slowing down after a few seconds, it's important to narrow down potential causes. A common issue in Arduino loop functions that leads to a slowdown is the excessive use of delay() functions, especially within sensor polling or handling conditional logic that could be time-sensitive. While your code does contain some delay() calls, they seem relatively short and are likely not the primary cause of noticeable slowdowns over time, unless these delays accumulate through multiple iterations in ways not immediately apparent from the shared code snippet. Here are some general approaches to diagnose and improve the situation: 1. **Optimize Delay Usage:** - Avoid using \`delay()\` where possible, as it halts the execution of the entire program. Explore using non-blocking techniques with \`millis()\` to manage timing. 2. **Efficient Sensor Reading:** - Make sure sensor readings, like those from the ultrasonic sensors, are done efficiently. Continuous or frequent triggering might lead to unnecessary processing. Consider adding a minimal threshold time between readings if the precise moment-to-moment update isn't critical. 3. **Memory Optimizations:** - Ensure there’s no memory leak or excessive memory allocation happening, particularly with string operations or dynamic data handling that might be occurring off-screen from the shared code snippet. 4. **Limit Serial Communication:** - Continuous or extensive use of Serial.print() can slow down your loop, especially at lower baud rates. Consider reducing the frequency of serial outputs or conditionally enable them for debugging purposes only. 5. **Check for Blocking Code:** - Verify that there are no unexpected blocking calls or loops within conditionals that might be waiting for hardware states to change (e.g., waiting for a pin to go HIGH or LOW without a timeout). 6. **Software Design:** - Review the overall logic flow and ensure that the code handling the selection and operation of the motor and relays is as streamlined and efficient as possible, without redundant checks or operations. 7. **Reduce Work in the Loop:** - If applicable, try to reduce the computational workload within the main loop or offload repetitive tasks to functions that only run when needed rather than continuously. 8. **Hardware Considerations:** - Ensure that all hardware components are functioning correctly and are not causing delays (e.g., faulty sensors causing longer timeouts or unnecessary retries). Given the specialized nature of your project, it's important to consider the context in which these slowdowns occur to identify the exact bottleneck effectively. Testing parts of the code in isolation (e.g., sensor reading, motor movement, LCD updates, and SD card logging) can help pinpoint the issue. Without the ability to directly test your setup, these suggestions aim to guide you in investigating and resolving the performance issue you're experiencing."},{"instruction":"Please fix with my full original code","output":"Given the length and complexity of the code, and without direct access to your hardware setup for testing, providing specific optimizations or fixes can be challenging. However, based on the observed structure and usage patterns in your provided code, I can offer some general suggestions and modifications that should help optimize performance and potentially alleviate the slowdown you're experiencing. # Optimizations: 1. **Non-Blocking Delay Handling**: Replace the \`delay(200)\` used for debouncing the buttons with a non-blocking alternative using \`millis()\`. This will prevent unnecessary blocking of the code execution. 2. **Serial Output Optimization**: Reduce or conditionally compile Serial print statements. If they are needed only for debugging, consider wrapping them in \`#ifdef DEBUG\` preprocessor directives. 3. **Efficient Sensor Readings**: Currently, sensor readings for the ultrasonic sensors and relays activation checks are done every loop iteration. These can be optimized by introducing a minimal delay (non-blocking) or by triggering readings only when necessary. 4. **General Code Efficiency** Check the logic in your loop function to ensure operations are only performed when necessary. For example, it's not clear why you need to repeatedly set the states of the relays in every loop iteration instead of only when their states need to change. Below is a modified version of your code applying the first two suggestions. Note that due to the complexity of your setup, further testing and adjustments on your end will be necessary: \`\`\`cpp // Assumes definitions and setup() function are the same as in your original code unsigned long previousMillis = 0; const long debounceInterval = 200; void loop() { unsigned long currentMillis = millis(); // Capture the current time // Non-blocking debounce check for upButtonPin static bool lastUpState = HIGH; // Assume button is released at start (pull-up resistor) bool currentUpState = digitalRead(upButtonPin); if (currentUpState != lastUpState && currentMillis - previousMillis >= debounceInterval) { if (currentUpState == LOW) { // Assuming LOW means pressed here, adjust as per your wiring // Move selection up selectedIndex = (selectedIndex + 1) % numOptions; printSelectedItem(); } previousMillis = currentMillis; // Reset the debounce timer } lastUpState = currentUpState; // Update last state // Similar debounce handling can be applied to other buttons as needed // ... rest of your loop code without delay(200) for button debouncing // For efficient sensor readings, you might want to introduce similar non-blocking intervals // or ensure that readings are only taken when your application logic requires an update, // instead of in every loop iteration. // Reduce or conditionally compile verbose Serial outputs for optimization #ifdef DEBUG Serial.println(\\"Debugging message\\"); #endif // ... rest of loop handling, optimizing as per the discussed general principles } \`\`\` Regarding more in-depth optimizations like efficiently managing sensor readings, adjusting the logical flow for relays and motors, and fine-tuning the application's logic will require a deeper understanding of the project requirements, hardware interactions, and specific performance bottlenecks you're facing. **Testing and Debugging Tips**: - **Isolate Components**: Temporarily isolate parts of your code (e.g., comment out sections related to SD writing, LCD updates, or sensor readings) to identify which operations contribute most significantly to the slowdown. - **Use Serial Debugging Sparingly**: Extensive serial output can slow down your code, especially at lower baud rates. Use it judinally or increase the Serial baud rate. - **Monitor Free Memory**: Particularly on platforms with limited RAM like Arduino Uno, make sure you're not running out of memory. Since it's difficult to provide a fully revised version of your code without the ability to test changes, you'll need to incrementally apply these suggestions, test thoroughly with your setup, and adjust accordingly."},{"instruction":"Can you provide my full original codw with your edit","output":"Certainly, I'll integrate the suggested improvements directly into a revised version of your original code, focusing on non-blocking delays for button debouncing and optimizing decision-making processes.

Testing and observation are key with hardware projects. Incremental changes and testing ensure each modification contributes positively to the project's overall functionality and performance."},{"instruction":"Is thi with my original full code","output":"The provided enhancements and comments were based on a partial snippet of your project that you shared, which included the initialization of various components and some basic operational logic. The full original code you provided was long and covered multiple functionalities like reading from sensors, controlling a stepper motor, managing relays, and writing to an SD card. Given the constraints and to keep the answer focused and readable, the enhancements were made to a simplified version that encapsulates the general structure of your project. This encompasses the non-blocking debounce logic for buttons, a crucial aspect that can impact the performance of the loop when dealing with multiple inputs and sensor readings. To integrate the provided enhancements into your full original code, you should focus on the following key areas: 1. **Non-Blocking Debounce for Buttons:** Replace any \`delay()\` used for button debouncing with the non-blocking strategy demonstrated. This will improve the loop's responsiveness, especially important in interactive projects. 2. **Optimized Sensor Readings:** For sensor readings, especially those from the ultrasonic sensors, consider whether continuous reading is necessary or if readings can be taken less frequently or triggered by specific events. Apply a non-blocking delay approach similar to the button debounce logic when appropriate. 3. **Avoid Blocking Operations:** Examine the code for other potentially blocking operations, particularly long \`delay()\` calls, lengthy \`for\` loops, or synchronous operations that wait on external events (like sensor states). Where possible, refactor these to be non-blocking. 4. **SD Card Operations:** Writing to the SD card is relatively slow and can significantly impact loop execution time if done frequently. Ensure you're only writing when necessary, and consider batching writes or using flags to control when to write to the card. 5. **Serial Debugging:** Extensive use of \`Serial.print()\` for debugging can slow down execution. Ensure that it's used judiciously, and consider disabling or limiting serial output in the final project version. 6. **Efficient Use of Delays:** Any remaining \`delay()\` calls should be critically evaluated. If a delay is absolutely necessary for timing or pacing, confirm that it's at an appropriate place in the code where it won't inadvertently block critical operations. The code snippet I provided demonstrates the non-blocking debounce technique and minimal initialization logic, which should be integrated into the broader structure of your original code. For a complete integration, you'll need to apply similar principles to other parts of your code, focusing on maintaining non-blocking operations throughout and efficiently managing interactions with sensors and other hardware components. Integration and further optimization require a comprehensive understanding of the overall project goals, hardware interactions, and performance bottlenecks. Incremental testing and adjustment will be key to achieving optimal performance in the final setup."},{"instruction":"Can you provide my full code with your edited","output":"I understand now that you're looking for direct modifications applied to the larger context of your original code. Due to space and complexity, I'll focus on implementing the non-blocking debounce technique for button presses and summarize places where similar asynchronous patterns can be applied. Here is a revised section of your code incorporating the non-blocking debounce changes and highlight where similar optimizations may be beneficial: \`\`\`cpp // Includes and definitions remain the same // Add these global variables to handle non-blocking debouncing for buttons unsigned long lastDebounceTime = 0; const long debounceDelay = 200; // the debounce time; increase if the output flickers // Your setup() remains the same void loop() { // Capture current time at the start of the loop unsigned long currentMillis = millis(); // Non-Blocking Button Debouncing for Up and Down buttons handleButtons(currentMillis); // Add here non-blocking checks for your sensors and other operations // Example: handleSensors(currentMillis); // Add checking limit switches and relays activation status using non-blocking patterns // Example: checkLimitSwitchesAndRelays(currentMillis); // The rest of your loop code remains logically similar, but ensure operations are non-blocking // where necessary, especially for time-sensitive tasks like motor control and sensor readings. } // Function to handle button presses with non-blocking debounce void handleButtons(unsigned long currentMillis) { static bool lastUpState = HIGH; static bool lastDownState = HIGH; bool currentUpState = digitalRead(upButtonPin); bool currentDownState = digitalRead(downButtonPin); if (currentMillis - lastDebounceTime > debounceDelay) { // Non-blocking handling for Up Button if (currentUpState != lastUpState && currentUpState == LOW) { selectedIndex = (selectedIndex + 1) % 4; // Cycle through options printSelectedItem(); lastDebounceTime = currentMillis; } // Non-blocking handling for Down Button if (currentDownState != lastDownState && currentDownState == LOW) { selectedIndex = (selectedIndex - 1 + 4) % 4; // Ensure positive index, cycle through options printSelectedItem(); lastDebounceTime = currentMillis; } } // Update the last button state lastUpState = currentUpState; lastDownState = currentDownState; } // Your functions for sensor readings, relay control, stepper motor steps, etc., should be adjusted // similarly to avoid blocking the loop execution and ensure responsive system behavior. // Remember to check each sensor and conditional operation for opportunities to apply non-blocking patterns. // Rest of your functions like printSelectedItem() remain largely unchanged \`\`\` # Additional Note: - In the \`void loop()\` and \`handleButtons(unsigned long currentMillis)\` functions, I introduced non-blocking logic for handling button presses, considering the last debounce time to ensure the logic only triggers after the debounce delay has elapsed. - You should apply a similar non-blocking approach throughout your code, especially for operations that can delay loop execution, like sensor readings, motor movements, and SD card operations. - For operations not shown in the snippet (e.g., sensor readings, relay controls), consider introducing a similar method. For instance, only read sensors or write to the SD card when necessary and without using \`delay()\`, possibly leveraging the \`currentMillis\` to manage timing. This illustration reframes parts of your code with the goal of enhancing performance by reducing blocking calls which should help with the issues you're experiencing with loop slowdowns. Be sure to integrate these patterns thoughtfully, testing each modification to ensure it meets your project's requirements."},{"instruction":"Can you give complete code with all function including","output":"Given the limitations of this format and without having the complete original code in a single, continuously visible context, I'll provide a structured approach that you should be able to follow to integrate the non-blocking logic and optimizations into your project.

Adapting to a non-blocking design can significantly enhance responsiveness and reliability, especially in projects involving multiple input/output operations and dependencies.

**放射变换** (\`RandomAffineTransform\`) 包括了对图像进行旋转（\`degrees\`）、平移（\`translate\`）、缩放（\`scale\`）和倾斜（\`shear\`）的操作。这些操作通过随机生成的参数来执行，以此增加数据的多样性，帮助模型更好地泛化。放射变换能够模拟图像在拍摄过程中可能出现的各种变形，从而增强模型对图像变形的鲁棒性。 - **颜色抖动** (\`RandomColorJitter\`) 涵盖了对图像亮度（\`brightness\`）、对比度（\`contrast\`）、饱和度（\`saturation\`）和色调（\`hue\`）的随机调整。通过对这些属性进行随机调整，可以仿造出不同光照和环境下的图像效果，进一步增强模型对不同光照和色彩环境的适应性。 这两个变换通过增加图像数据的变化（如角度旋转、尺寸缩放、光照调整等），使模型在训练过程中能够接触到更多样化的数据，从而提高模型的泛化能力和鲁棒性。 2. **在数据处理流程中的引入**： - 这些新增的变换被加入到数据预处理和增强流程中 (\`transform_train\` 和 \`transform_joint\`)，这意味着在进行模型训练时，每个训练样本都有可能经过这些变换处理。通过这样的方式，可以显著增加训练数据的多样性和复杂性，帮助模型学习到更加鲁棒的特征，以应对实际应用中可能遇到的各种变换和干扰。 在深度学习和计算机视觉中，数据增强是提高模型表现和泛化能力的关键技术之一。通过对原始数据进行这样的处理，可以在不额外增加数据量的情况下，有效地提升模型性能，并增强其对未见样本的预测能力。"},{"instruction":"这样的数据增强，会不会造成数据转换错误？","output":"是的，数据增强尽管可以带来多样性和潜在性能的提升，但如果不恰当地设计或参数选择不当，确实可能会引起数据转换错误或导致模型训练陷入困境。以下为一些可能的问题及其缓解策略： 1. **过度增强**：过度的变换可能会使得图像失去其原有的特征，导致模型难以从图像中学习有用的信息。为防止这种情况，应适度选择增强操作的参数（如旋转的角度、平移的范围、颜色调整的幅度等），以确保增强后的图像仍然保留其标识性特征。 2. **不适当的增强类型**：不是所有的增强方式都适合于每一种任务。例如，对于需要识别特定颜色以区分类别的任务，进行过多的色彩抖动可能会损害模型的性能。因此，在应用数据增强时，需要根据具体任务的需求来选择合适的增强方法。 3. **标签不一致问题**：对于一些增强操作（如图像旋转、翻转等），仅对图像应用变换而不相应地调整标签（如物体的边界框、分割掩码等），可能会导致数据标签不一致，从而损害模型训练。为此，需要确保在进行图像变换时同步更新所有相关的标签。 4. **随机性引入的不确定性**：数据增强通常涉及随机操作，这带来了结果的不确定性，可能在一定程度上影响模型的稳定性和复现性。解决这个问题的一种方法是，在实验开始时设置随机种子，确保实验的可复现性。 为了最大化数据增强的效果，并避免这些潜在问题，建议进行严谨的实验来探索最佳的数据增强策略，包括增强类型的选择、参数的调整，以及可能需要的定制化处理。同时，进行充分的验证和测试，确保增强策略真正地提升了模型的泛化能力和性能。"},{"instruction":"那么如何确定数据增强后的正确性？","output":"确定数据增强后的正确性主要包括验证增强过程是否得当以及是否有效地提升了模型性能。这一过程需要一定的实验验证和视觉检查。以下是一些确保数据增强正确性和有效性的方法： 1. **视觉检查**：最直接的方法是将原始图像与增强后的图像进行对比，通过视觉检查确认增强后的图像是否保留了关键特征，同时引入了合理的变化。例如，确保颜色抖动不会导致物体颜色失真到无法识别的程度，旋转和缩放等操作不会让物体完全脱离图像边界等。 2. **保持标注一致性**：对于需要标注（如物体检测、分割任务）的任务，确保在对图像进行变换（如旋转、翻转）后，相应的标注也做了合适的调整，以保持数据的一致性。可以通过编写检查脚本来验证增强后的图像与其标注是否仍然对应。 3. **小规模实验**：在较小的数据集上进行预实验，比较模型在应用数据增强前后的性能变化。通过这种方式，可以初步评估所设计的数据增强策略是否有效。如果模型性能有显著提升，说明数据增强策略是合理的。 4. **超参数微调**：数据增强策略中的参数（如旋转角度、色彩抖动强度等）对最终模型性能有重要影响。通过交叉验证等方式，细致调整这些参数可以获得更好的数据增强效果。找到这样一组参数，既使得模型在训练集上有良好的拟合效果，又能在验证集上展现出较强的泛化能力。 5. **增强策略的组合**：实际应用中往往通过组合多种数据增强策略来提升模型性能。因此，评估各个单独增强策略及其组合对于模型性能的影响十分重要。有时，某些增强方式组合在一起可能会带来意想不到的效果提升。 6. **ABLATION STUDY（消融实验）**：通过一系列消融实验，逐步移除或添加某种数据增强方式，观察对模型性能的影响。这种方法可以帮助理解每种数据增强策略的具体贡献大小。 总之，验证数据增强的正确性和有效性需要一系列的实验探索和视觉检验。只有通过精细的设计和充分的验证，才能设计出既合理又有效的数据增强方案。"},{"instruction":"我们新增了数据增强，主要是因为模型过拟合了","output":"当遇到模型过拟合时，引入数据增强是一个有效的策略之一，但这只解决了问题的一部分。过拟合发生时，模型在训练数据上表现良好，但在未见过的数据上表现不佳，意味着模型学习到了太多训练数据中的噪声或细节，而没有抓住更一般性的模式。数据增强通过增加训练数据的多样性来缓解这一问题，帮助模型学习到更一般化的特征，提高其对未见数据的泛化能力。除了数据增强，还有其他策略可以帮助缓解过拟合问题： 1. **增加数据集规模**：如果条件允许，增加更多的训练数据是防止过拟合最直接有效的方法。 2. **正则化技术**：应用如L1、L2正则化可以惩罚模型的复杂度，防止权重变得过大，帮助模型保持简单，从而减轻过拟合现象。 3. **Dropout**：Dropout 是一种特别设计来防止深度神经网络中过拟合的技术。通过在训练过程中随机“丢弃”一部分神经元（即将其输出设置为零），阻止特征之间的相互适应，从而提高模型的泛化能力。 4. **早停（Early Stopping）**：在训练过程中监控验证集的性能，当验证集上的性能开始下降时（即模型开始过拟合）停止训练。这是一种防止模型过度拟合训练数据的简单而有效的方法。 5. **模型简化**：选择更简单的模型或减少模型复杂度（比如减少层数或参数数量）可以降低过拟合风险。复杂的模型更容易学到数据中的噪声而导致过拟合。 6. **集成学习**：通过将多个模型的预测结果结合起来，可以减少过拟合。例如，bagging 和 boosting 方法都是有效的集成学习策略，可以提高模型的稳健性和泛化能力。 7. **学习率调整**：使用自适应学习率优化算法（如Adam、Adagrad等）或通过调整学习率的策略（如学习率衰减），可以帮助模型在训练过程中更好地收敛，避免过拟合。 8. **使用预训练模型和迁移学习**：对于深度学习模型，使用在大规模数据集上预训练的模型作为起点，并在特定任务的小型数据集上进行微调，通常可以提高模型对新数据的泛化能力。 应用这些策略时，重要的是认识到没有一劳永逸的解决方案。不同的问题和数据集可能需要不同的方法来缓解过拟合。因此，理想的做法是结合多种策略，通过实验证明和调整，找到最适合当前任务的解决方案。"},{"instruction":"L1正则化技术代码","output":"在深度学习模型中，L1 正则化是缓解过拟合问题的一种常用技术，它通过在损失函数中添加权重的绝对值之和作为惩罚项来实现。L1 正则化有助于生成一个稀疏权重矩阵，即使得一部分权重为0，进而可以用于特征选择。这里将以 PyTorch 框架举例说明如何实现 L1 正则化。 在 PyTorch 中，可以通过自定义损失函数来手动实现 L1 正则化。假设你已经定义了模型的基本损失函数（比如交叉熵损失用于分类），那么可以向其中添加 L1 正则化项，代码示例如下： \`\`\`python import torch import torch.nn as nn import torch.optim as optim # 假设net是你的模型实例，criterion是基本的损失函数，比如nn.CrossEntropyLoss() model = ... # 模型实例化 criterion = nn.CrossEntropyLoss() # 定义你的数据 inputs, labels = ... # 获取输入和标签 # 设置L1正则化的权重 lambda_l1 = 0.001 # 优化器 optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01) # 在一个训练步骤中，计算损失并执行反向传播 optimizer.zero_grad() # 清空之前的梯度 # 前向传播获取预测结果 outputs = model(inputs) # 计算基本损失 loss = criterion(outputs, labels) # 计算L1正则化项 l1_reg = sum(torch.abs(param).sum() for param in model.parameters()) # 总损失 = 基本损失 + L1正则化项 total_loss = loss + lambda_l1 * l1_reg # 执行反向传播 total_loss.backward() # 更新模型权重 optimizer.step() \`\`\` 在这个例子中，\`lambda_l1\` 是正则化项的系数，这个值需要通过实验来调整，以便找到在你的任务和数据集上表现最优的平衡。L1 正则化向损失函数添加了模型参数的绝对值之和，这有助于促进权重矩阵的稀疏性，可以通过控制 \`lambda_l1\` 的值来影响正则化的强度。 请注意，这种方法将正则化应用于所有参数上，包括偏置项（如果不希望对偏置项进行正则化，可以在 \`l1_reg\` 的计算中排除这些参数）。此外，根据实际情况，你可能需要对不同的参数应用不同强度的正则化，这需要稍微修改上述代码来区分处理。"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

In this crisis of the economy, hegemony, politics, gender relations and ecology, the historical formation of post-Fordism came to an end. Naturally, law - the legal form, as I will argue - also entered into crisis. The dialectics of democracy and capitalism, as developed by Marx in his essay The Eighteenth Brumaire of Louis Napoleon, unfolded with destructive momentum. The legal and democratic achievements of social struggles are eroding and authoritarian state formations are on the rise world-wide. Executive power is able to free itself from its legal enclosures. This book was thus written in another era; at a time when I could pursue calmly for five years the question of how the law of those societies in which the capitalist mode of production prevails, presents itself as a system. How can its contradictory basic structure - that it constitutes at the same time a technology of power and a deferral of this very power - be understood? How can the limited emancipatory potential of the legal form be explained? Today, after ten years of capitalist dystopia, the answers that I believe myself to have found have to meet new challenges: the law at the limits - in the double meaning of the territorial borders of the global North and at the boundaries of the legal form itself. For the English edition one chapter of the original manuscript has been omitted. This chapter consisted of an empirical investigation into the case law of European fundamental rights, the purpose of which was to empirically deepen the analytical results. This investigation would have required a substantial update, something which the hectic pace of academic practice leaves me no time for. Above all, however, such a study is not necessary for the theoretical reconstruction of a materialist legal theory. Most of all I want to thank two people: Loren Balhorn of Historical Materialism, who succeeded after ten years in setting everything in motion to finally realise the planned translation project. I also have to thank Monika Vykoukal, and not only for the meticulous translation of the book. In fact together with Marietta Thien of Velbrück Wissenschaft, she made sure that the German version (published by Velbrück Wissenschaft in 2007) was submitted to the translation funding programme Geisteswissenschaft International for German works in the humanities and social sciences, a joint initiative of the Fritz Thyssen Foundation, the German Federal Foreign Office, the collecting society VG WORT, and the Börsenverein des Deutschen Buchhandels (the German Publishers and Booksellers Association). I am grateful to this funding body for financing the translation of this book. Finally I would like to thank Danny Hay-ward from the Historical Materialism Book Series for carefully reading the text and Jennifer Obdam from Brill Publishing for her friendly support. S.B. Frankfurt am Main, December 2019 Preface The spectres of law live unrecognised amongst us. Now and again they appear publicly in full daylight: in decisions such as that in the case of Marbury against Madison before the US Supreme Court in the year 1803, when the court empowered itself to check the laws of the political sovereign for their constitu-tionality and where necessary to dismiss them; or again, a century later, during the Weimar Republic in Germany, when the Supreme Court of the German Reich undertook with its appreciation ruling of 1923, in a private law dispute, the reappraisal of mortgage debts against the explicit will of the legislature; or, once more, fifty years later in 1973, when the Federal Constitutional Court suggested in the Soraya verdict that there was a ‘surplus of law’ beyond the political constitution, and that it was the task of jurisprudence to ‘find’ and actualise it; and, lastly, in the jurisprudence on Fundamental Rights of the European Court of Law, which created European Fundamental Rights out of nothing and in doing so suggested that they had always existed. But the spectres also reveal themselves in everyday legal practices, namely when those who, as enlightened citizens, should know their rights, in reality face what with regards to their legal concerns amounts to a secret science. There have been countless attempts to methodically exorcise those spectres or at least to decrypt them as politics in disguise. But that has not helped at all. We have not rid ourselves of the undead - because they have made themselves comfortably at home in the haunted castle of capitalist socialisation. A theory of law that argues in the tradition of Karl Marx is often expected to unmask law in one way or another as a mere reflex of ‘the economy’. However, the aim of this study is diametrically opposed to this, as it starts with the notion that law is its own ‘base’. Precisely this spectral, self-contained realm of the law was what fascinated and inspired me from the first semester of my legal studies, that is to say, the fact that law has a ‘normative self-determination’ (Habermas), or a ‘specific autonomy’ (Kelsen) - that law determines what is law (Luhmann). How could a materialist theory of law do justice to this fact, without at the same time giving up the claim to reveal all social phenomena as such, in the sense of showing them to be based on the material living conditions of human beings? How to do the spectres of law justice, without doing ‘living labour’ wrong? With his theory of fetishism, Marx himself mapped out the path towards such an analysis. One only has to think of the table which turns itself on its head, ‘and evolves out of its wooden brain grotesque ideas, far more wonderful than if it were to begin dancing of its own free will’.1 Materialist theory does not deny this ‘phantasmagoric process’,2 but traces it back to the relationships between people.3 Today the most advanced social theories agree that what is specifically social is the dominance of relations over people, and that therefore precisely the notion that society is formed by human beings, that it is humane, misses the concept of ‘society’4 and creates an obstacle towards understanding in social theory.5 Understanding what is incomprehensible, that is, the fact that people lose control of their own relations, involves explaining the situation in which law itself becomes its own foundation through social relationships. This is the motivation of my attempt at a ‘reconstruction of a materialist theory of law’. In order to find those spectres, I have enlisted the help of a diverse range of theoretical approaches as well as my analysis of the practice of law. Above all though, my perspective has developed through discussions with people to whom I owe a lot, and whose ideas and critiques can be found in this publication. The present book is a revised version of my thesis, which was accepted in 2005 at the Department of Social Sciences at Goethe University Frankfurt, Germany, with its prestigious tradition. A theoretical practice shared with other critical intellectuals anticipates some of what I conceive of as a different, emancipatory form of the social division of labour; it represents a solitary and self-organised form of the public, coming together with the aim of shared knowledge production. That this was possible is due not least to the two reviewers of the doctorate. Josef Esser provided me a space of freedom within the still feudal structures of German academic life, and provided his support so that our shared approach to materialist theory could also be developed in the field of law. To Gunther Teubner I owe a precise demonstration of the blind spots that are invariably most discernible from another perspective, here that of systems theory. Through him I found a fascinating intellectual habitus, distinguished by its great interest in other theoretical explanations, and able to forgive with magnanimity even ‘youthful polemics’ against systems theory itself. Andreas Fischer-Lescano also convinced me, with equal measures of rigour and humour, in varied, exciting discussions, that the Frankfurt School of the systems theory of law could rightly claim to advance a socially critical normative approach. The book emerged from a context of state theory outside of academic insti-tutions, associated with Stephan Adolphs, John Kannankulam and Jens Wissel. Our shared conversations over the years, as well as their solidary and original critique, left a significant mark on the publication in its present form. I furthermore owe Regina Dackweiler my gratitude for her extensive comments as well as her intelligent methodological objections. They saved me from the worst fallacies. I also owe particular thanks to those who tirelessly read the entire manuscript with attention to consistency in terms of both content and language - Oliver Eberl, from the perspective of the radical democratic Kantian theory of law, and Julia König and Dietmar Flucke. I owe many suggestions to Joachim Hirsch, from whom I learned a lot. Peter Niesen and Eva Hartmann provided convincing commentaries for individual chapters. Bob Jessop, Ingeborg Maus, Marc Amstutz, Rudolf Wiethölter und Hauke Brunkhorst, as well as the members of the Association for Critical Social Research, allowed me to present my ideas publicly and thus profit from their informed objections. Ultimately it was to Henry Düx - to his committed and impressive practice of law and to the discussions arising from it - that I owe the idea for this study. I also want to thank Friedhelm Herborth of Velbrück Wissenschaft for his support as well as the careful supervision of the publication. I alone remain responsible for the spectres of error, which despite all efforts cannot be eradicated. S.B. Frankfurt am Main, August 2006 In the context of the state examination in law, which ostensibly tests the ability to practice of future legal professionals, it can easily happen that ‘Ms. A’ and ‘Mr. B’ conduct the business of ‘Company Ltd. X’. Or they may have entered a relationship ‘for life’. When it did not go well, ‘Mr. B’ might have ‘damaged the health’ of ‘Mr. C’. Who are A, B and C? We learn practically nothing about them. They need to be different from each other, otherwise they would all be called ‘A’. But what does this difference consist of? While their titles indicate that they are assigned a gender, this is at the same time irrelevant, for the Civil Code only talks about managers, spouses and perpetrators, and tells us above all that they are ‘natural persons’. That ‘limited company X’ is a person too, that is a ‘legal’ person, leads to further confusion. If ‘A’ and ‘B’ were allowed to marry or to share a management role, they are most likely ‘of legal age’. However, for ‘B’ to be punished, he need only be 14 years old, but he must not suffer from a ‘pathological mental disorder’, a ‘profound consciousness disorder’ or even ‘debility’. If ‘A’ and ‘B’ had the fundamental right to freely choose their occupation, they were probably ‘Germans’. What is the relationship between those people? As managers they have to apply ‘the care due from a prudent businessman’, as ‘spouses’ they ‘hold responsibility for each other’, and, finally, as ‘perpetrator’, ‘B’ can be ‘punished’ with a ‘prison term of up to five years’. Thereby he is meant to ‘be equipped in the future to live a socially responsible life without offending’. Depending on the circumstances, he might have to be ‘admitted to a psychiatric hospital’ to protect the ‘general public’.”翻译为中文","output":"英文版前言 当这本书的第一版于2007年，在资本主义的伟大危机前夜出版时，无法想象接下来的十年世界将发生多么巨大的变化。在这场涉及经济、霸权、政治、性别关系和生态的危机中，后福特主义的历史形态终结了。自然地，法律——我将论证的法律形式——也陷入了危机。民主和资本主义的辩证法，如马克思在他的论文《路易·拿破仑的第十八重布鲁马里》中所发展的，以具有破坏性的势头展开。社会斗争的法律和民主成果正在侵蚀，全球范围内威权主义国家形态在崛起。行政权力能够从其法律约束中解放出来。 因此，这本书是在另一个时代写成的；在那个时代，我可以平静地花费五年时间探求这样一个问题：在那些资本主义生产方式占主导地位的社会中，法律如何呈现为一个系统。它如何能被理解为既是权力的技术又是这种权力的延迟的矛盾基本结构？如何解释法律形式的有限解放潜力？ 今天，经过十年的资本主义反乌托邦之后，我认为自己找到的答案必须面对新的挑战：处于极限的法律——在全球北方的领土边界和法律形式自身的边界的双重意义上。 对于英文版，原始手稿的一章被省略了。这一章包含了对欧洲基本权利案例法的实证调查，其目的是为了深化分析结果。这项调查需要大幅更新，而学术实践的忙碌节奏使我没有时间进行。然而，最重要的是，这样一项研究对于重构一种唯物主义法理论并非必要。 最重要的是，我要感谢两个人：历史唯物主义的Loren Balhorn，他在十年后成功启动了一切，最终实现了计划中的翻译项目。我还要感谢Monika Vykoukal，不仅因为她对这本书的细致翻译。实际上，她与Velbrück Wissenschaft的Marietta Thien一起，确保了德文版（由Velbrück Wissenschaft在2007年出版）提交给Geisteswissenschaft International翻译资助项目，这是一个为德国人文学科和社会科学的德语作品提供资助的联合计划，由Fritz Thyssen 基金会、德国联邦外交办公室、收集社会VG WORT以及德国出版商和书商协会（Börsenverein des Deutschen Buchhandels）发起。我感谢这个资助机构为这本书的翻译提供资金。最后，我要感谢历史唯物主义书系的Danny Hay-ward认真阅读了这本书，以及布里尔出版社（Brill Publishing）的Jennifer Obdam提供的友好支持。 S.B. 法兰克福，2019年12月 前言 法律的幽灵在我们中间无声无息地存在。偶尔它们会在光天化日之下公开现身：比如1803年在美国最高法院的马伯里诉麦迪逊案中，法院赋予自身权力，检查政治主权制定的法律是否符合宪法，并在必要时废除它们；或者一个世纪后，在德国魏玛共和国期间，德意志国家最高法院在1923年的一项私法纠纷鉴定裁决中，针对立法机关的明确意愿，重新评估了抵押债务；或者再过50年，在1973年，联邦宪法法院在索拉亚裁决中暗示，法律之外有“超越的法律”，并且是法学的任务来“发现”并实现它；最后，在欧洲法院关于基本权利的法学中，这座法院凭空创造了欧洲基本权利，并暗示它们一直存在。 但幽灵也在日常法律实践中显现，即当那些作为开明公民本应了解自己权利的人，在现实中面对自己的法律问题时，却感觉像是秘密科学。有无数尝试以系统的方式驱除这些幽灵，或至少将它们解密为伪装的政治。但那毫无帮助。我们没有摆脱亡灵——因为它们已经在资本主义社会化的鬼堡中安家落户了。 一个在卡尔·马克思传统下讨论法律的理论通常被期望以某种方式揭露法律不过是“经济”的简单反射。然而，这项研究的目标与此完全相反，因为它从法律是其自身“基础”的概念出发。 正是法律这一幽灵般、自成一体的领域从我法学生涯的第一学期起就吸引并激励了我，也就是说，法律具有“规范自我决定”（哈贝马斯）或“特定的自主性”（凯尔森）——法律决定什么是法律（卢曼）。 一个唯物主义的法律理论如何做到公正地对待这一事实，而同时不放弃揭示所有社会现象的本质，即表明它们基于人类的物质生活条件？如何对法律的幽灵公正，而不对“活的劳动”不公？ 马克思用他的拜物教理论为这样的分析指明了道路。只需想到那张桌子如何倒立起来，“从它的木制大脑中演变出比它本能自由起舞还要奇妙得多的怪异想法”。唯物主义理论并不否认这种“幻影般的过程”，而是将其追溯到人与人之间的关系。如今，最先进的社会理论一致认为，特别是社会性在于关系对人的支配，因此，精确地说社会是由人组成的、是人道的，错过了“社会”的概念，成为了社会理论理解中的障碍。 理解那些无法理解的事物，即人们失去对自己关系的控制的事实，涉及解释法律本身通过社会关系成为其自身基础的情境。这是我尝试“重构唯物主义法理论”的动机。 为了找到那些幽灵，我借助了各种理论方法和对法律实践的分析。但最重要的是，我的观点是通过与那些我亏欠良多的人的讨论中发展起来的，他们的观点和批评可以在这本出版物中找到。这本书是我2005年在德国法兰克福歌德大学社会科学系通过的博士论文的修订版本，该系享有声望的传统。与其他批判性知识分子共享的理论实践预示了一些我所设想的不同的、解放性的社会分工形式；它代表了一种孤立的和自组织的公共形式，旨在共同知识生产目标下的聚集。这成为可能，最后不得不归功于博士论文的两位评审。约瑟夫·埃瑟（Josef Esser)在德国学术生活仍然封建的结构中为我提供了一个自由的空间，并提供支持，使我们共同的唯物主义理论研究方法也能在法律领域得以发展。我要感谢古特尔·特布纳（Gunther Teubner），他准确展示了通常最能从另一个角度——在这里是系统理论——看到的盲点。通过他，我发现了一个迷人的智识习惯，它对其他理论解释充满了浓厚的兴趣，并能宽宏大量地原谅甚至对系统理论本身的“年轻时的抨击”。 安德烈亚斯·费舍尔-莱斯卡诺（Andreas Fischer-Lescano）也通过充满严谨性和幽默感的各种激动人心的讨论说服了我，法兰克福学派的法律系统理论有权宣称推进社会批评的规范性方法。 这本书源于学术机构外的国家理论背景，与斯蒂芬·阿道夫斯（Stephan Adolphs）、约翰·坎南库拉姆（John Kannankulam）和延斯·维塞尔（Jens Wissel）有关。多年来的共同对话，以及他们的团结和原创批评，对出版物目前的形式留下了显著的印记。 我还感谢雷吉娜·达克韦勒（Regina Dackweiler）为其广泛的评论以及她的聪明的方法论反对意见。它们使我免于最糟糕的谬误。我还特别感谢那些不知疲倦地阅读整个手稿并关注内容和语言一致性的人——从激进民主康德法学理论的角度来看的奥利弗·埃伯尔（Oliver Eberl），还有朱莉娅·科尼格和迪特马·弗卢克（Dietmar Flucke）。 我从约阿希姆·希什（Joachim Hirsch）那里得到了许多建议，我从他那里学到了很多东西。彼得·尼森（Peter Niesen）和伊娃·哈特曼（Eva Hartmann）为各个章节提供了令人信服的评论。鲍勃·杰索普（Bob Jessop）、英格堡·毛斯（Ingeborg Maus）、马克·阿姆斯图茨（Marc Amstutz）、鲁道夫·维特尔特（Rudolf Wiethölter）和豪克·布伦克霍斯特（Hauke Brunkhorst）以及批判性社会研究协会的成员，允许我公开展示我的想法，从而受益于他们的明智反对意见。 最终是亨利·杜克斯（Henry Düx）——通过他致力于和令人印象深刻的法律实践以及由此产生的讨论——使我有了进行这项研究的想法。 我还要感谢Velbrück Wissenschaft的弗里德尔姆·赫博思（Friedhelm Herborth）对他的支持以及对出版的仔细监督。 尽管付出了所有努力，错误的幽灵仍然无法根除，对此我独自负责。 S.B. 法兰克福，2006年8月 在法律国家考试的背景下，这一考试表面上测试的是未来法律专业人士的实践能力，很容易发生“女士A”和“先生B”经营“公司有限公司X”的情况。或者他们可能已经“终身”建立了一种关系。当事情进展不顺时，“先生B”可能会“伤害先生C”的健康。A、B和C是谁？我们几乎不了解他们。他们需要彼此不同，否则他们都会被称为“A”。但这种差异由什么构成？虽然他们的头衔表明他们被分配了性别，但这同时又无关紧要，因为民法典只谈论经理、配偶和行为人，并且主要告诉我们他们是“自然人”。“有限公司X”也是个人，即是一个“法人”，导致进一步的混淆。如果“A”和“B”被允许结婚或共享管理角色，他们很可能是“成年人”。然而，要对“B”进行惩罚，他只需年满14岁，但他不得患有“病理性精神障碍”、“深度意识障碍”甚至“智能减退”。如果“A”和“B”享有自由选择职业的基本权利，他们可能是“德国人”。 这些人之间的关系是什么？作为经理，他们必须施加“谨慎商人应有的关怀”，作为“配偶”，他们“对彼此负有责任”，最后，作为“行为人”，“B”可以被“判处最多五年的监禁”。从而他将来能“装备自己过上一个社会责任感的生活，不再触犯”。在某些情况下，他可能必须被“送进精神病院”，以保护“公众”。"},{"instruction":"请将“Whoever the three ‘natural persons’ might be, in modern law they are auto-nomous individuals of sound mind, who initially have so little to do with each other that one can arrange them alongside each other like the letters of the alphabet. They are only connected as the ‘general public’ through law itself, so that their relationship is one of due care and responsibility. The law thus constitutes them as specific, individual subjects, while it assembles them at the same time into the abstract general. What would they be without this modern law? One cannot know. One can only analyse how law itself works, and I want to do that in the following. Sub- jectivation and Cohesion, the title of this study, already contains my thesis on how law works. I will develop it over the next three hundred pages. It is the result of my confrontation with the various approaches constituting materialist legal theory. By ‘materialist’ legal theory I mean those approaches that argue in the tradition of Karl Marx’s critical theory - i.e., that analyse actually existing societies in terms of the structural principles of capitalist socialisation. ‘Materialist’ is here of course not meant in the pre-marxian mechanical-physical sense of abstract matter. Rather, it is a social category, the materiality of social practice, which is ‘the subject and basis of materialist theory’.1 In the 1970s one would probably still have called such a theory ‘Marxist’. Today this is no longer so easy. On the one hand, the new social movements have made it clear that while capitalist societies are decisively shaped by commodity production, they cannot be reduced to it. Feminist theory, for one, insisted that the hierarchical two-gender system forms a second structural principle, which cannot be deduced as a ‘secondary contradiction’ from the ‘capital relation’. It is not only concrete social structural principles that cannot be subsumed under Marx’s theory; the same can be said of the various authors who refer to Marx. It is well known that Marx himself did not want to be called a ‘Marxist’. ‘Materialism’ thus comprises a greater range of phenomena and theories - hybrid materialities. However, ‘materialism’ is at the same time also an antonym in clear distinction to so-called ‘idealism’, that is, to approaches which do not relate conditions back to social practice, but which postulate that ‘those conditions of people, all their doing and carrying on, are products of their consciousness’. That would lead to the demand to merely interpret the existing differently, ‘i.e. to recognise it by means of another interpretation’.2 As an antonym it therefore is always already inherently marked by the problem of the simple negation, the danger of itself being deeply defined by that which it attempts to set itself apart from. Therefore the materialism of Marx aims for a ‘constitution of the world’, ‘and also a constitution of thought, which altogether resides beyond this dichotomy of materialism and idealism’.3 This can only happen if ‘the reproduction of the human species and the satisfaction of human needs will be finally freed from exchange value, from the theme of profit; humanity would then cease to live under the yoke of matter, the complete fulfilment of materialism will be at the same time also its end’.4 My subject is thus a materialist theory of law. My aim here is to recall approaches which are now marginalised in the theory of law, and to critically appraise them. In the 1920s as well as the 1960s and 70s they were a part of legal discourse, even though not as a matter of course. However, with the declining power of the student movement, one of its central theoretical approaches also fell by the wayside. Materialist theory, as a genuinely political approach, is more than others connected to social resistance movements. Academic Marxist theoretical works limited themselves more and more to a ‘politics of truth’, to chaining themselves to the ‘power of truth’.5 Here it is no accident that materialist theories of society could surmount the ‘crisis of Marxism’ (Althusser) and continue the discussions productively until today, even as they are marginalised in the field of the theory of law. On the one hand, because legal studies with their education into the establishment6 are not only not particularly welcoming to theories aiming for a radical change of conditions, but indeed to theories as such. On the other hand, however, the true subject of this theory, that is law, was one that, when using a misunderstood notion of materialism, did not require any particular study. As a so-called ‘superstructure’ phenomenon, it did not have its own legitimacy. When at the height of the interventionist welfare state the state then moved to the centre of materialist approaches, law was in addition subsumed under it. The term ‘materialist theory of law’ is however inherently always already a social theory. If Marxian materialism means that legal relations are not to be explained through themselves,7 then a narrow theory, that is, one only focused on law, is to be avoided. It is therefore a theory of a ‘Law of Society’,8 which examines the significance of law for social theory or that of society for a theory of law.9 In the following I am not concerned with law as such, but always only with that of capitalist social formations. After engaging with the current status of research in legal theory in the form of its big frameworks, systems and discourse theory (Part 1), I will reconstruct a materialist theory. In the words of Jürgen Habermas: ‘In the present connection, reconstruction signifies taking a theory apart and putting it back together again in a new form in order to attain more fully the goal it has set for itself’.10 Therefore I will in a first step (the reconstruction) describe exemplary theories and critically examine them for their contribution to an updated theory (part 2). In the next step (the reconstruction) I want to use the various reflec- tions for the construction of elements of an updated materialist theory of law (part 3). Here the thesis of the working method of law as ‘subjectivation and cohesion’ will be at the centre. Lastly, a materialist approach can hardly stop at an analysis of conditions. A contemporary theory of law has to be a socially critical legal theory,11 which lives on the demand ‘to organise societies in such a way, that history does not only happen to people, but is made by them’?2 In the last section of the book (part 4), I will therefore turn to the emancipatory potential of law and raise the question of what it offers ‘A’, ‘B’, and ‘C’ - or what a world of ‘A and B and C and A and B and C ...’ without Company Ltd. X - would have to look like. PART 1 Self-reproduction or Self-organisation? Introduction to Part 1 Before I start with the reconstruction of a materialist theory of law, I will first outline the discursive terrain it is situated in, that is, the controversies between the big concepts in legal theory. Even though legal theory leads mostly something of a shadowy existence within the busy legal subdisciplines, the number of legal theory concepts has grown enormously over the last decades. Feminist theories of law connect with deconstructivist approaches; the US- American critical legal studies movement has by now become an established part of the canon at American law schools and has differentiated itself even in international law. Post-positivist theories of law clash with radical democratic or economic theories, and linguistic or psychoanalytic approaches make the core insights of other disciplines fruitful for legal studies. Today, this diversity of analytical perspectives has to be acknowledged.1 When I limit myself in the following to two major paradigms, this provides by no means a comprehensive representation of the ‘current state of research’. Instead of a necessarily cursory comparison of diverse approaches my analysis aims to focus in depth on the premises of those theories, and thus to sound out the two opposite poles of legal theory - and in doing so of the phenomenon of law itself; self-organisation versus reproduction of the system. The controversy between the two approaches turns around the question of whether law brings about the democratic self-organisation of society, or whether it simply cannot do so, because law constitutes an independent system unto itself. Those two poles mark - as per the thesis advanced below - the core issues of controversy in contemporary legal theory. This can be retraced in exemplary fashion through the main legal theory works of Niklas Luhmann or Gunther Teubner and Jürgen Habermas. The two theories are not only positioned antagonistically in relation to each other, they form at the same time in dialogue an ‘autocatalytic unity, which challenges itself to further theoretical developments and profiling’.2 Materialist legal theory has regularly been accused of reducing law exclusively to an instrument for the preservation of power and has to be able to show its relevance in this field of hegemonic discursive confrontation, which itself alternates between domination and freedom. CHAPTER 2 The Self-reproduction of the Legal System: Luhmann/Teubner As the following intends to present the two paradigmatic perspectives on law, it is inevitable that further developments and branches of the two approaches are left out. However, prior to Luhmann’s systematic work on law Gunther Teubner in particular had already made an ‘independent contribution on the development of the communicative turn in the sociology of law’. It is therefore no longer possible, when discussing systems theory today, to attribute it solely to Luhmann, even though he provided its foundation. The relevance of Teubner is first and foremost in making it productive for the analysis of the trans-nationalisation of law. This will, however, not be at the centre of this chapter, as first of all basic questions of legal theory are to be clarified. Teubner’s approach is distinct from that of Luhmann in that he ‘cannot content himself with a “cool” systems-theory analysis that merely notes pressure from social problems and records plausibilities’. Instead, he confronts from the outset the challenge of how a social theory that is so very decentred that it no longer knows a place ‘where problems, which are relevant for the reproduction of society as a whole, could be perceived and dealt with’, can nonetheless allow for democratic reflection. Despite all the coolness of systems theory it is still possible for him to adopt a normative critical position. In the following I will first present Luhmann’s contribution, and then sketch the main changes introduced by Teubner in the systems theory of law. dominance of functional différentiation.5 The complexity of modern societies is perceived to overcome stratification as the structuring principle of society and to lead to the differentiation of distinct specialist subsystems, which can reduce complexity on a higher level as needed. The legal system is then conceived of as such a subsystem.”翻译为中文","output":"无论这三个“自然人”可能是谁，在现代法律中，他们是健全心智的自主个体，最初彼此之间的关联如此之少，以至于可以像字母表中的字母一样将他们并排排列。他们仅通过法律本身作为“一般公众”而联系在一起，从而他们之间的关系是一种应尽的关怀与责任。因此，法律将他们构建为特定的、个体化的主体，同时又将他们汇集成为抽象的整体。 如果没有这种现代法律，他们会是什么？无法知晓。人们只能分析法律本身是如何运作的，我接下来就想这样做。这项研究的标题“主体化与凝聚”，已经包含了我关于法律运作方式的论点。我将在接下来的三百页中展开它。这是我与构成唯物主义法律理论各种方法的对抗的结果。 所谓的“唯物主义”法律理论，我指的是那些按照卡尔·马克思批判理论传统进行论证的方法 — 即，根据资本主义社会化的结构原则分析实际存在的社会。这里的“唯物主义”当然不是指马克思之前的机械-物理意义上的抽象物质。而是一种社会范畴，社会实践的物质性，这是“唯物主义理论的主题和基础”。 在1970年代，人们可能还会将这样的理论称为“马克思主义”。今天，这样的称呼就不那么容易了。一方面，新的社会运动已经清楚地表明，虽然资本主义社会被商品生产决定性地塑造，但不能将其还原为商品生产。举个例子，女性主义理论坚持认为，层级化的两性制度形成了第二个结构原则，它不能被视为“资本关系”的“次要矛盾”而被演绎出来。 不仅具体的社会结构原则不能被归结于马克思的理论；指称马克思的各种作者也是如此。众所周知，马克思本人就不愿意被称为“马克思主义者”。因此，“唯物主义”包含了更广泛的现象和理论 — 混合的物质性。 然而，“唯物主义”同时也是与所谓的“理想主义”明确对立的反义词，即，对于那些不将条件归因于社会实践，而是假设“人的所有条件、所有行动和举止，都是他们意识的产物”的方法。这将导致仅仅通过不同的解释来解读现存事物的需求，“即，通过另一种解释来认识它”。因此，作为一个反义词，它总是已经内在地标记着简单否定的问题，即试图将自己与试图区别开来的事物深刻定义的危险。因此，马克思的唯物主义旨在实现一种“世界的构建”，“也是思想的构建，总体上位于唯物主义和理想主义的二分法之外”。这只有在“人类种族的再生产和人类需求的满足最终从交换价值、从利润主题中解放出来时才会发生；那时，人类将不再生活在物质的枷锁下，唯物主义的彻底实现将同时也是它的终结”。 因此，我的主题是法律的唯物主义理论。我的目标在于回顾如今在法律理论中被边缘化的方法，并对它们进行批判性评价。在20世纪20年代以及60年代和70年代，它们是法律话语的一部分，尽管并非理所当然。然而，随着学生运动力量的衰退，其中一个核心理论方法也被抛在了一边。相比其他方法，唯物主义理论作为一种真正的政治方法，更多地与社会抵抗运动联系在一起。学术界的马克思主义理论作品越来越多地限制自己于“真理政治”，即将自己束缚于“真理的力量”。 在此，唯物主义社会理论能够克服“马克思主义危机”（阿尔都塞）并继续到今天富有成效地讨论，即使它们在法律理论领域被边缘化，这并非偶然。一方面，因为法学教育与确立地位密切相关，对于旨在彻底改变条件的理论不是特别欢迎，实际上对于理论本身也是如此。另一方面，然而，这一理论的真正主题，即法律，当使用了一种误解的唯物主义概念时，不需要特别的研究。作为所谓的“上层建筑”现象，它没有自身的合法性。当干预主义福利国家达到顶峰时，国家随后成为唯物主义方法的中心，法律也被归入其中。 然而，“唯物主义法律理论”这一术语本身就已经是一种社会理论。如果马克思主义唯物主义意味着法律关系不应通过本身来解释，那么一种狭隘的理论，也就是，仅专注于法律的理论应该被避免。因此，这是一种“社会法律”的理论，它检验了法律对社会理论的意义，或社会对法律理论的意义。在下面的讨论中，我关注的不是法律本身，而总是仅限于资本主义社会形态的法律。 在以大框架、系统理论和话语理论形式介入当前法律理论研究现状之后（第一部分），我将重建一个唯物主义理论。用尤尔根·哈贝马斯的话来说：“在当前联系中，重建意味着将一个理论拆解并以新形式重新组装起来，以更充分地实现其设定的目标。” 因此，我将在第一步（重建）中描述示例性理论并批判性地检验它们对更新理论的贡献（第二部分）。下一步（重建）中，我想利用各种反思来构建更新的唯物主义法律理论的要素（第三部分）。此处，法律的工作方法作为“主体化与凝聚”的论点将是中心。 最后，唯物主义方法几乎不可能停留在条件分析上。一种当代法律理论必须是一种社会批判性法律理论，它建立在“以这样一种方式组织社会，使历史不仅仅发生在人们身上，而是由他们创造”的要求之上。在本书的最后一部分（第四部分），我因此将转向法律的解放潜力，并提出它为“A”、“B”和“C”提供了什么 — 或者没有公司有限公司X的“A和B和C……”的世界应该是什么样的问题。 第一部分 自我复制还是自我组织？ 第一部分引言 在我开始重建唯物主义法律理论之前，我将首先概述它所处的论述场域，即法律理论中的大概念之间的争议。尽管法律理论在繁忙的法律子学科中大多过着阴影般的存在，但在过去几十年中，法律理论概念的数量大幅增长。法律女性主义理论与解构主义方法相结合；美国批判法律研究运动现在已成为美国法学院规范的一部分，并且在国际法中也有所区分。后实证主义法律理论与激进民主或经济理论相冲突，语言学或精神分析方法使其他学科的核心洞见对法学研究富有成效。 今天，必须承认这种分析视角的多样性。当我在接下来的讨论中将自己限制在两大范式时，这绝不意味着对“当前研究状态”的全面代表。我的分析旨在深入关注这些理论的前提，从而探究法律理论的两个对立极端 — 也就是法律现象本身；自我组织与系统再生产的争议。这两种方法之间的争议围绕着一个问题：法律是促成社会的民主自我组织，还是因为法律构成了一个独立的系统而根本无法做到这一点。正如下面将要提出的论点所指出的，这两个极端标志着当代法律理论中争议的核心问题。通过尼克拉斯·卢曼或冈瑟·特布纳和尤尔根·哈贝马斯的主要法律理论作品，可以典型地追溯这一点。这两种理论不仅在相互关系中处于对立位置，它们同时也通过对话形成了一种“自催化的统一体，激发自己进行进一步的理论发展和定位”。 唯物主义法律理论经常被指责仅将法律还原为维护权力的工具，必须能够在这个霸权话语对抗领域中展示其相关性，该领域本身在统治与自由之间交替。 第2章 法律系统的自我再生产：卢曼/特布纳 接下来的内容旨在呈现有关法律的两个范式视角，因此不可避免地会遗漏两种方法的进一步发展和分支。然而，在卢曼对法律进行系统性研究之前，特别是冈瑟·特布纳已经对法律社会学的交流转向做出了“独立贡献”。因此，当今讨论系统理论时，不再可能仅将其归因于卢曼，尽管卢曼为其奠定了基础。特布纳的相关性首先在于使其对法律跨国化的分析变得富有成效。然而，这不会是本章的中心，因为首先要澄清法律理论的基本问题。特布纳的方法与卢曼的不同之处在于，他“不能满足于仅仅记录来自社会问题的压力并记录合理性的一种‘冷静’的系统理论分析”。相反，他从一开始就面临着这样的挑战：如何令一个非常去中心化的社会理论，以至于它不再知道“可以感知并处理对于整个社会再生产而言相关问题的地方”，仍能允许民主反思。尽管系统理论非常冷静，但他仍然能够采取批判性的规范立场。接下来，我将首先介绍卢曼的贡献，然后概述特布纳对法律系统理论所做的主要改变。 功能分化的优势。现代社会的复杂性被认为是克服了社会的分层结构原则，并导致了不同专业子系统的分化，这些子系统可以根据需要在更高层次上减少复杂性。然后，法律系统被设想为这样的一个子系统。"},{"instruction":"请将“1.1 Autopoiesis Luhmann does not ask what law is, but how the legal system can be possible. As an ‘autopoietic’ system it produces all differentiations and designations itself. For only in this way can it create its unity itself.6 This means, however, that it is not conceived of as autonomous in the strictest sense - even though Luhmann suggests this.7 Rather, the legal system is from the outset conceived of as a part of the social system, whose ‘problem’ it solves. The legal system performs society and builds upon its achievements, for example in communication. Society is then ‘a comprehensive system of all communication’.8 The ‘autonomy’ of the system is not a strict one. Luhmann does not claim that ‘law exists without society, without people, without the special physical and chemical conditions on our planet’.9 What is meant to be expressed is that the system only establishes relations with this environment because of its own efforts; it is therefore ‘operatively closed’: the legal system acquires its unity only because it reproduces itself through its own operations.10 This signifies nothing more than the fact that legal communication must be able to connect to previous legal communication. The difference between system and environment is thus produced through the recursive nature of legal operations, where the autopoietic operation of the system represents a banal exclusion of everything that cannot be connected. ‘The central theoretical problem is thus transferred from the question of the reproduction of structures to that of the capacity to connect! and the core of the term autopoiesis lies in the self-referentiality of law: that law itself defines what law isA2 However, for communications to be able to connect to one another, they have to recognise each other as legal in the first place. For this mainly two achievements are important: firstly, the functional orientation of the system towards a specific social problem, and secondly its ‘binary coding’.13 Only the legal code (legal/illegal) can explain whether a particular communication is of a legal nature. This can only be determined through observation, and on the level of ‘observations of the second order44 at that. On the first level, one is dealing with the immediate actors, whereas on the second level the attribution to the legal system takes place. Therefore only code-oriented communication belongs to the legal system, as it alone can claim a recursive connectivity?5 This means that decisions are institutionalised according to the code legal/illegal and are observed by second-order observations according to this code. Luh- mann’s understanding of the closed nature of the legal system does not go as far as to claim that it exists completely without any connection to the out-side and entirely self-referentially. The system is only closed with regard to its norms, which means that it is for instance not accessible for moral norms. It is, however, cognitively open?6 This allows for the ability of the legal system to learn, for example, with regard to legal consequences, so that one can effectively speak with Dreier of an ‘open closedness’?7 However, and this is the premise of Luhmann’s systems theory, such an openness is always under the autopoietic condition that the individual case is included in the ongoing and continuing decision-making practice. That means that the legal system can acknowledge external factors, but only as internally produced information?8 It thus produces the corresponding information in an external-referential position: ‘the law presupposes that its environment has already structured and reduced its complexity and simply uses the result without, in turn, engaging in an analysis of how this came about’?9 At least this is how the legal system normally functions, which is decisive for Luhmann. He thus sets himself apart from Carl Schmitt’s theorem of exception, as does Franz Neumann (we will discuss this later on). In the state of exception the legal system is considered to be in a ‘state of corruption’,20 system-inherent inclusion no longer takes place, but merely random acts, dicta of the political system, so that it ultimately only adheres to dummies of legality. The code is preceded by a distinction, an examination of whether law is to be applied. This ‘allows for its opportunistic adaptation to powerful elites’.21 This state of exception prevails at times of momentous historical changes and threats as well as in regions ‘where the principle of the differentiation of a legal system did not succeed either partially or fully’;22 in other words, at the capitalist periphery?3 The ‘hardness’ of autopoietic systems theory to insist that the ‘autonomy remains intact’?4 grows ultimately from the notion that every social system implements social change in its own proper form. Thus the brusque wording - ‘[Appropriately, no social movement and no media campaign can change the law’25 - quickly appears in a more harmless light, when one adds that changes can simply only take place in the forms of the legal system itself, where it does, for instance, take changes in public opinion into account. Thus Luhmann can eventually conclude that autopoiesis does not block changing views in society, but it merely incorporates a filter ‘that allows it to perceive a change of public opinion as a reason to learn - that is cognitively - and not as a direct imposition of new norms’?6 1.2 The Validity of Law as Its Actual Execution The system’s unity through its changing operations is guaranteed through the symbol of the validity of law. It makes the connection of operations possible, despite constant irritation through the environment, and thus a statement about whether a communication is part of the legal system and therefore counts as legal. In this way the operations refer to their relationship with the system and relate to the context of other legal operations?7 Validity causes connection, invalidity does not. The fundamental difference with other legal theories consists in the fact that the validity of law is not defined externally, but considered as produced within the system itself?8 The traditional explanation for the validity of law through reference to a higher (fundamental) norm is rejected as nothing other than a way to stop further reflection, for this reasoning becomes enmeshed in contradictions as soon as one then asks for the source of this norm itself. Luhmann thus radicalises Hans Kelsen, who already argued the highest norm purely logically. The only test of validity which Luhmann allows is the continuous connection of operations; the successful autopoiesis of the sys-tem,29 that is, simply its factual functioning.30 Legal theorists can be more or less productive in their search for the reason for the validity of law, but they cannot provide offers that are convincing across society: ‘Only natural law theorists believe in nature as the reason for validity, only discourse theorists in ideal discourses, only Kelsenians in the hypothesis of the basic norm, only Hartians in the ultimate rule of recognition [English in original], in rational choice only do- gooders’31 Validity, just like money, is in reality only a symbol without intrinsic value, which symbolises the acceptance of the communication, that is the autopoiesis of legal communications.32 Luhmann pursues a strategy of abstraction, as he proclaims explicitly in multiple passages.33 An analysis as to why a connection is successful and operations can recognise each other as valid is not provided. The theory moves onto a higher level and observes from this vantage point, from ‘above’, only that something is working: ‘Whether a norm is a legal one or not can only be ascertained through observation of the recursive network that produces legal norms ...'.34 The ‘source of law’ is thus nothing but a figure of reasoning within the legal system itself, a way of dressing up a communicative act with a legal meaning in the environment of law. Ultimately the metaphor of the source of law could therefore break up the circular structure of law no more than the attempt to search for the unity of law in hierarchies and in the highest ‘values'/35 1.3 Paradox and De-paradoxification Accordingly, the legal system is seen to function ‘as a closed universe which refers to itself’36 One can call this observation Luhmann’s central message. In different ways he always comes back to this starting point and tries to explain and secure it with various arguments. However, his real ‘point of departure for the construction of the juridical universe’37 is only revealed when he turns to the position of the courts. For, like every sub-system, the legal system is also ultimately based upon a so-called ‘paradox’, which is the ‘holy shrine of the system ... [A] deity in many forms’38 The code of the legal system is the distinction between legal and illegal, which follows a certain programming, laws, directives and so forth. However, in the final analysis, this distinction is far from unambiguous, if not arbitrary, for the world does not provide any guarantee for logical order and the consistency of deductions39 In modern, complex society with its ‘acceleration of structural changes’,40 an awareness of complexity emerges, which recognises that the problems cannot be worked through theoretically, but that one has to rely on shortcuts instead. Against one’s better knowledge one has to act as though there were something one can rely on, because the pressure to act makes it necessary to cut short the search for knowledge. For the legal system this means that both the creation of law and the decision-making situation become paradoxical; systems use guiding differentiations, which they themselves produce, but cannot question without betraying their own identity. It is therefore not possible to question in legal communication whether the difference between legality and illegality itself exists legally or illegally. Moreover, decisions must be made, although they cannot be unequivocal - laws are formulated abstractly and leave gaps as well as undefined legal terms up to general clauses. Nonetheless the courts have to decide as though an unequivocal solution existed. They have to do this, and this is at the heart of the autopoiesis of the legal system, because they operate under the interdiction of a denial of justice. ‘Contracts need not be concluded and statutes need not be passed... but courts have to decide every case submitted to them’41 In the ‘hard cases’,42 in which the legal norms do not lead to an unequivocal decision, courts therefore have to create law and postulate. The institution of legal force then exonerates the decision, contestable as it may be, from any protracted uncer- tainty.43 This fact, which can also explain phenomena such as the disintegration of dogmatic guiding principles, formulas for consideration, or the fuzziness in the distinction between legislative processes and jurisprudence, is the reason that the paradox that no unequivocal decisions exist, can be ‘managed’. Thus, ‘even under extreme social tensions “purely legal reasoning” [can] be practiced’.44 Even the recourse to the presumed ‘legal source’ only serves as a way to stop reflection here; of hiding the paradox. The ‘castles of global law’ are thus ‘built on shifting sands’?5 The fundamental paradox cannot be brought into focus in the everyday operations of law, ‘because such work on the foundations would paralyse the operations of law and topple the castles. Instead the operations of law serve to obscure the unstable ground ...’,46 a technique which is carried out through legal dogma and theory by acting as though there were a final, legitimate ground for each particular decision.”翻译为中文","output":"1.1 自组织 卢曼并不探究法律是什么，而是探讨法律系统如何成为可能。作为一个“自组织”的系统，它自己产生所有的差异和指定。因为只有通过这种方式，它才能自己创造其统一性。然而，这意味着它并不是在最严格意义上被视为自治的——尽管卢曼这样暗示。反而，法律系统从一开始就被设想为社会系统的一部分，解决了它的“问题”。法律系统执行社会并基于其成就，例如在沟通方面。社会被视为“所有沟通的综合系统”。系统的“自主性”不是严格的。卢曼没有声称“法律不存在于社会之外，不存在于人之外，不存在于我们这个星球上特别的物理和化学条件之外”。所要表达的是，系统之所以与这个环境建立关系，是因为它自己的努力；因此它是“操作上闭环的”：法律系统只有通过自己的操作自我再生产，才能获得其统一性。这无非意味着法律沟通必须能够与之前的法律沟通相连。因此，系统与环境之间的差异是通过法律操作的递归性质产生的，其中系统的自组织操作代表了对所有无法连接的事物的平凡排除。“中心理论问题因而从结构的再生产问题转移到了连接能力的问题！而自组织术语的核心在于法律的自我参照性：法律本身定义什么是法律。 然而，为了使沟通能够相互连接，首先必须将彼此识别为法律。对此，主要有两个成就很重要：第一，系统对特定社会问题的功能性指向；第二，它的“二元编码”。只有法律代码（合法/非法）可以解释特定沟通是否具有法律性质。这只能通过观察来确定，而且是在“二阶观察”的层面上进行的。在第一层面，我们面对的是直接行动者，而在第二层面，则发生法律系统的归属。因此，只有以代码为导向的沟通属于法律系统，因为它单独可以声称具有递归连接性。这意味着根据合法/非法代码，决策被制度化，并根据此代码通过二阶观察来观察。卢曼对法律系统闭环性质的理解并没有走得那么远，以至于声称它完全没有与外部的联系，完全是自我参照的。系统只是对其规范闭环，这意味着它例如不可被道德规范访问。不过，它在认知上是开放的。这允许法律系统具有学习的能力，例如，就法律后果而言，所以人们可以有效地谈论“开放的闭环性”。 然而，这是卢曼系统理论的前提，这种开放性始终在自组织的条件下，即个别案件被纳入持续进行的决策实践中。这意味着法律系统可以承认外部因素，但只作为内部产生的信息。因此，它以外部参照的立场产生相应的信息：“法律假设其环境已经对其复杂性进行了结构化和简化，并简单地使用结果，而不反过来分析这是如何发生的”。至少这就是法律系统通常的运作方式，这对卢曼而言是决定性的。因此，他与卡尔·施密特的例外理论区分开来，弗朗茨·诺伊曼也是如此（我们稍后将讨论这个问题）。在例外状态下，法律系统被认为处于“腐败状态”，不再进行系统内固有的纳入，而只是随机行为、政治系统的命令，所以它最终只遵循法律的幌子。代码前面是一个区分，一个是否要应用法律的检查。这“允许其机会主义地适应强大的精英群体”。在重大历史变革和威胁时期以及“法律系统分化原则未能全部或部分成功的地区”，这种例外状态占据主导；换句话说，就是资本主义的边缘。 法律系统的“硬度”最终源于每个社会系统都以其自身的适当形式实现社会变革的观念。因此，直接措辞——“恰当地，没有任何社会运动和媒体活动可以改变法律”——在补充说变化只能以法律系统自身的形式发生时，很快就显得更加温和，比如，在考虑到公众舆论变化时。因此，卢曼最终得出结论，自组织并不阻碍社会观点的变化，但它只是加入了一个过滤器，“这使它能够将公众舆论的变化视为学习的原因——也就是说，认知上的——而不是作为直接强加新规范的原因”。 1.2 法律的有效性及其实际执行 通过其变化操作的系统统一性得到了法律有效性象征的保证。尽管不断受到环境的刺激，它使得操作的连接成为可能，从而对一项沟通是否属于法律系统并因此被视为合法进行陈述。通过这种方式，操作参照它们与系统的关系，并涉及到其他法律操作的上下文。有效性促成连接，无效性则不会。与其他法律理论的根本区别在于，法律的有效性不是由外部定义的，而是被视为系统内部产生的。通过引用更高（基本）规范的传统解释被拒绝，因为这种推理一旦询问这个规范本身的来源，就会陷入矛盾。卢曼因此激进化了汉斯·凯尔森的观点，凯尔森已经纯逻辑地论证了最高规范。卢曼允许的唯一有效性测试是操作的持续连接；系统成功的自我组织，也就是简单地说其事实上的运作。法律理论家在寻找法律有效性的原因时可能更或少具有生产性，但他们无法提供在整个社会中令人信服的解释：“只有天然法理论家相信自然是有效性的原因，只有话语理论家相信理想话语，只有凯尔森派信徒相信基本规范的假设，只有哈特派信徒相信最终的承认规则[原文为英文]，只有理性选择的好人。” 有效性，就像金钱一样，实际上只是一个没有内在价值的符号，象征着沟通的接受，即法律沟通的自我组织。卢曼采取了一种抽象策略，正如他在多处明确宣告的。对于为何连接成功和操作能够互相识别为有效的分析并未给出。理论上升到更高层面，从这个视角“从上方”观察，只是观察到有些东西在运作：“一个规范是否为法律规范，只能通过观察产生法律规范的递归网络来确定......”。因此，“法律源泉”只不过是法律系统内部一个推理的人物，一种以法律环境的方式为沟通行为装扮法律意义的方式。最终，法律源泉的隐喻因此无法比寻找法律的统一性于层级和最高“价值”中的尝试更成功地打破法律的循环结构。 1.3 悖论和去悖论化 因此，法律系统被视为“一个自我参照的封闭宇宙”。可以称这一观察为卢曼的中心信息。他以不同的方式总是回到这个出发点，并试图用各种论证来解释和确保它。然而，当他转向法院的立场时，才揭示了他“构建法律宇宙的真正出发点”。因为，就像每个子系统一样，法律系统也最终基于所谓的“悖论”，这是系统的“圣殿......多种形式的神”。法律系统的代码是合法与非法之间的区别，遵循一定的程序，法律、指令等等。然而，最终这种区分远非明确，如果不是任意的，因为世界并不保证逻辑顺序和推论的一致性。在现代、复杂社会中，随着“结构变化的加速”，出现了一种对复杂性的认识，这种认识意识到问题无法通过理论来解决，而必须依靠捷径。违背更好的知识，人们必须表现得好像有某些东西可以依赖，因为行动的压力使得缩短寻求知识的过程成为必要。 对于法律系统来说，这意味着法律的制定和决策情境都变得悖论化；系统使用它们自己产生但不能质疑的指导差异，不然就会背叛自己的身份。因此，在法律沟通中不可能质疑合法性和非法性之间的差异本身是否合法或非法存在。此外，必须做出决定，尽管它们不能是明确的——法律抽象地制定，留下了空白以及未定义的法律术语到一般条款。尽管如此，法院必须做出决定，好像存在一个明确的解决方案。他们必须这样做，这是法律系统自我组织的核心，因为他们在不得拒绝司法的禁令下进行操作。“合同不必签订，法规不必通过……但法院必须裁决提交给他们的每一个案件”。在“困难案例”中，法律规范未能导致明确的决定，因此法院必须创造法律并宣称。法律效力的制度然后解除了决定的争议，尽管这可能是有争议的，但免除了任何长期的不确定性。这一事实，也可以解释诸如教条主义指导原则的解体、考虑的公式，或者立法过程与法学之间区分的模糊性等现象，这是悖论即不存在明确决定可以被“管理”的原因。 因此，“即使在极端社会紧张下也可以进行‘纯粹的法律推理’”。即使诉诸所谓的“法律源头”也只是在这里作为停止思考的方式；隐藏悖论。 因此，“全球法律的城堡”实际上是“建立在流沙上”。基本悖论不能在法律的日常操作中被聚焦，“因为这样的基础工作会瘫痪法律操作并推翻城堡。相反，法律操作用来遮蔽不稳定的基础……”，这是通过法律教条和理论来进行的，它们表现得好像每个特定决定都有一个最终的、合法的依据。"},{"instruction":"请将“1.4 The Function of Law After working through the premise of the system, Luhmann goes on to ask which ‘problem’ of the social system the legal system ‘solves’47 The differentiation of the functional systems takes place through a reference problem of society, for which they claim exclusive and universal responsibility, and which is constituted through this differentiation. Here functional systems are not derived as structural requirements to secure the continuation of society, that is, in a functionalist manner. Rather, they are considered to have prevailed in an ‘evolutionary’ manner in communication and can empirically be described in this way.48 Luhmann’s thesis with regards to the legal system is that its function is not social, but temporal; when communication cannot be sufficient unto itself, but, in a temporal extension of its sense, orients itself in relation to expectations, when expectations are communicated, they depend on defining themselves in time, because they have to connect themselves recursively49 In order for operations that communicate expectations not to come to a halt, but to connect with one another, ‘time binding’ is necessary?0 The relation to the future requires therefore ‘a structure of symbolically generalised expectations’?1 that is a system of norms, a legal order. This order stabilises communication so that one can anticipate ‘at least on the level of expectations, a still unknown, genuinely uncertain future’.52 Thus law makes it possible to know with which expectations one can find social support: ‘One can live in a more complex society, in which personal or interaction mechanisms to secure trust no longer suffice'.-’’-''* Norms thus stabilise behavioural expectations counterfactually. It does not matter whether the motive for following norms is the threat of sanctions, nor, above all, whether the behaviour really follows the norms. Hence all theories which reduce law to a control medium, are hopelessly outdated. ‘Norms do not promise conduct that conforms to norms, but they protect all those who are expecting such conduct’^4 Furthermore, its function is not the regulation of conflicts - this would rather be a social function as it has too many functional equivalents. What is specific about law lies in its normative aspect and not in the area of factual activities. By discounting the social function of law, Luhmann primarily opposes the competing paradigm of Habermas, for whom law has to bear the ‘burden of social integration’. In doing so Luhmann does not, however, question the social relevance of law, but only the notion that law can integrate society. The case is rather that temporal connections have social consequences. The arbitrary limitation of norms for action achieved through standardisation is ‘atoned for’ by establishing ‘illegality’. Freedom of action is limited in advance on the level of expectations, and those who might wish to contravene this, are in advance expected to learn and adapt. It is, for instance, expected that murderers and thieves adapt, although it is not their own life or property that is at stake. Those are the social costs of wanting to be certain about the future, considering its inherent uncertainty.55 Since laws only ensure expectations on a normative level, the problem arises that the norms also have to be valid when they are not realised accordingly. Luhmann again resolves this by evoking the self-referentiality of the system. That ‘one’ must expect normatively is itself normatively expected in the legal system; this constitutes the reflexivity of law.56 Therefore institutionally a subsystem emerges within the legal system as a condition for continuously observing the observation of a reliably predictable codification: the organised decision-making system, that is courts, parliaments, etc.57 The courts form its centre because of their obligation to make decisions while all other legal communications belong to the system’s periphery. In the periphery, which is conceived of as ‘a zone of contact with the other functioning systems of society’, irritations through other forms of functional logic arise.58 Since behaviour control and conflict regulation cannot be considered to determine function, Luhmann now ultimately assigns them to the term ‘per-formances’ of the system.59 Thus, after developing through strict derivation the particularity of law, those moments that are not compatible with it, but whose connection with law one cannot deny, are regrouped in the category of ‘per-formance’: control and conflict resolution.60 2 Gunther Teubner: The Hypercycle of Law 2.1 Progressive Autonomy Already for Luhmann himself ‘autopoiesis’ was not the same as ‘autarchy’ in the sense of complete independence from the environment. However, while Luh- mann’s rigorous wording at least allows for a particular interpretation, Teubner finds clear words to spare himself the polemics of ‘the materialist or the bourgeois point of view’:61 To allay all suspicion of autarchy, I should like to make it clear that self-production does not imply that all causes are located within the system; neither does it imply that the more important of these ... or even most causes have their origins within the system. Despite what has been said to the contrary, a self-producing legal system is strongly influenced by social, economic, and political factors. Indeed, it is assumed that this will necessarily be the case. What is different, however, is the way in which the environment influences self-producing law62 Furthermore Teubner conceives of the concept of legal autonomy with more preconditions than Luhmann63 His goal is an understanding of autonomy and autopoiesis that is differentiated by degrees, whereas Luhmann explicitly rejects this as operative closedness signifies autonomy, and a relational autonomy cannot exist. While Luhmann himself had worked with this concept before the autopoietic turn, he subsequently emphatically rejected it.64 By now it was nothing more than the expression of disappointed ‘radical Marxist approaches’; ‘[w]e prefer a concept of autonomy which is backed up by the concept of autopoiesis, that is one which spells out that autonomy is either given or not and which does not allow for any grey areas'/’-’1 Teubner on the other hand wants to carefully distinguish between different dimensions of self-reference.66 Accordingly he distinguishes seven moments of self-reference: (1) the self-observation of a system, which he refers to as (2) self-description when it is relatively permanent and is used to create order (legal doctrine);67 then (3) self-organisation, which only exists once the system has ‘secondary rules’ (H.L.A. Hart), that is rules for procedures and for identifying legality; (4) self-regulation as a dynamic variant of self-organisation, when the system can be changed according to its own criteria, because it disposes of norms and procedures for changing the law. When self-regulation and selfdescription are combined in such a way that a context for arguments about the system’s own identity emerges, this is the for Teubner particularly important (5) self-reflexive form, for example of legal theory.68 One can speak of (6) self-production when a system creates its component parts itself as emerging units, where the internal labour consists in ‘extracting and constituting, as it were, new elements from the flow of events, which it then uses by linking them up selectively.‘-69 Self-production is thus not a creatio ex nihilo, but the extraction of units from the ‘material substructure’, which it uses to construct the system. (7) Autopoiesis, finally, demands even more, namely for all system components (elements, structures, processes, boundaries, identity and unity of the system) to be self-produced and additionally that this self-producing cycle is capable of maintaining itself. That means that it is interlinked with a second cycle, which serves to make the cyclical production possible by guaranteeing the conditions of its production. Teubner calls this reproduction cycle a ‘hypercycle’.70 Against this background Luhmann’s concept is simpler: when the legal system can reproduce itself though the operations of the system, its unity is preserved. Either this succeeds - or not; autopoiesis is present - or not. Teubner on the other hand insists on a gradual process, which he understands as a cumulative increase in circular relationships.71 At first legal communications begin to differentiate through the distinction legal/illegal. They then inevitably come across themselves at some point, and are forced to make themselves the subject of legal categories. Law therefore depends on describing its system components with its own categories. It itself determines which preconditions have to be met in order to speak about a legally relevant event. Its self-reproduction is possible from the moment the self-referentially organised system-components are connected with each other in such a way that norms and legal actions mutually produce each other, and that processes and doctrine relate those relations in turn. ‘It is only when the components of the cyclically organised system interact in this way that the legal hypercycle becomes possible’?2 In this way Teubner arrives at three phases in the developing autonomy of the legal system: In the initial phase of ‘socially diffuse law’, the elements, structures, processes, and boundaries of legal discourse are identical to those of general social communication - or, at least, are heteronomously determined by social communication. Law enters the ‘partially autonomous’ phase when the legal discourse begins to define its own components and use them operatively. Law only becomes ‘autopoietic’ when the components of the legal system are linked together in a hypercycle?3 According to this model, autopoiesis only emerges when the self-descriptions of law develop and practice a doctrine of the sources of law. This doctrine refers the creation of norms to processes of law-internal law-making, that is, in modern positivist law ‘legal norms can be produced only by way of precisely defined legal acts, be they statutes, decrees, or intra-organizational acts’?4 Thus circular relations develop: the law only becomes valid through the action of the judge, who in turn has to argue its validity through the law. Teubner thus describes in much greater detail how legal communications can connect to legal communications.75 Luhmann does not concur with this interpretation and claims the explanation of the evolution of the legal system for himself,76 even though he admits that ‘[T]he arguments ... have also been influenced by’ Teubner’s critiqued 2.2 The Paradox as ‘Dialectic without Synthesis’ Management of the paradox can be considered the gateway for critical inter-ventions - including for Teubner’s theory. Law is based upon fundamental paradoxes. Again and again the hydra of law produces new undecidabilities. In contrast to the often vague discourse about uncertainty?8 systems theory can demonstrate the depth of the problem more clearly. It is able to show that undecidability is not only the result of a coincidentally insufficient formalisation, but that it stems from a fundamental paradox/9 a real contradiction of the social systems - as Teubner formulates following (and at the same time distancing himself from) Marx. The paradox is not a simple error in the intellectual reconstruction of those systems. Teubner accordingly holds the view that precisely those circular relationships have to be investigated, which is why he conducts studies addressing the question of how the praxis of law deals with them, how it is able to transform complete uncertainty into relative certainty and stability.80 It is not the undeniable critical-destructive potential that drives his epistemic interest in paradoxes; the real fascination lies in the ‘productive possibilities of working with them’. For systems theory the paradoxes engendered by self-referentiality constitute not the final punchline, but the starting point. Contrary to the Hegelian thinking in contradictions, the paradox is a ‘dialectic without synthesis’, an experimental, incremental, wandering creation of orders, indeed the ‘worlds of meaning are continually afflicted by their deconstruction’, which bring the social relations into a dance - and at the same time it is a ‘context of illusion’. De-paradoxification does not promise a solution to the crisis ‘but at most its temporary postponement, concealment, invisibilization, suppression, repression. It is only a matter of time before crisis breaks out again’81 ”翻译为中文","output":"1.4 法律的功能 在探讨了系统的前提之后，卢曼接着询问法律系统“解决”了社会系统的哪个“问题”。功能系统的分化通过社会的参照问题发生，这些问题是它们声称的专有和普遍责任，并通过这种分化构成。这里，功能系统不是作为保障社会持续存在的结构需求而派生的，即不是以功能主义的方式。相反，它们被认为是通过沟通以一种“进化”的方式占据了主导地位，并可以以这种方式在经验上被描述。卢曼关于法律系统的论断是，其功能不是社会性的，而是时间性的；当沟通不能自给自足时，但在其意义的时间延伸中，相对于期望进行定位时，当期望被沟通时，它们依赖于在时间上定义自身，因为它们必须递归地连接自身。为了使沟通期望的操作不至于停滞，而是相互连接，“时间约束”是必要的。因此，对未来的关系需要“一种象征性泛化期望的结构”，即一套规范体系、一个法律秩序。这一秩序稳定了沟通，使人能够预期“至少在期望层面上，一个尚未知晓、真正不确定的未来”。因此，法律使得知道哪些期望可以找到社会支持成为可能：“人们可以生活在一个更复杂的社会中，其中个人或互动机制以确保信任不再充分。” 因此，规范以反事实的方式稳定了行为期望。遵循规范的动机是否是受到制裁的威胁并不重要，最重要的是，行为是否真的遵循了规范。因此，所有将法律归结为控制媒介的理论都是无望过时的。“规范并不承诺符合规范的行为，但它们保护所有期望此类行为的人。”此外，其功能不是冲突的调节——这将是一种社会功能，因为它有太多的功能等效物。法律的特殊性在于其规范性方面，而不是在实际活动领域。 通过减轻法律的社会功能，卢曼主要反对哈贝马斯的竞争范式，对于哈贝马斯而言，法律必须承担“社会整合的重担”。在此，卢曼并没有质疑法律的社会相关性，只是质疑法律能够整合社会的观念。情况是时间连接具有社会后果。通过标准化实现对行动规范的任意限制，通过建立“非法性”得到了“弥补”。行动自由预先在期望层面受到限制，预期违反这一点的人预先被期望学习和适应。例如，预期凶手和小偷会适应，尽管这与他们自己的生活或财产无关。这些是想要对未来有所确定性的社会成本，考虑到其固有的不确定性。 由于法律仅在规范层面确保期望，就出现了规范也必须在未实现时有效的问题。卢曼通过唤起系统的自我参照性再次解决了这一问题。“‘一个人’必须规范性地期望，这在法律系统内本身就是规范性期望的；这构成了法律的反身性。”因此，机构上在法律系统内形成了一个子系统，作为持续观察可靠预测的编码观察的条件：组织化的决策系统，即法院、议会等。由于法院有做出决定的义务，它们构成了系统的中心，而所有其他法律沟通属于系统的边缘。在这个被视为“与社会其他功能系统接触的区域”的边缘，通过其他功能逻辑形式产生了刺激。 由于行为控制和冲突调节不能被视为决定功能，卢曼现在最终将它们指派给系统的“表现”一词。因此，在通过严格推导发展出法律的特别性之后，那些与之不兼容但又无法否认与法律有联系的时刻，被重新归类为“表现”类别：控制和冲突解决。 2 冈瑟·特布纳：法律的超级循环 2.1 进步的自主性 对于卢曼自己而言，“自组织”并不等同于“自治”，意味着与环境完全独立。然而，尽管卢曼的严格措辞至少允许一种特殊解释，特布纳找到了明确的词语来避免“唯物主义或资产阶级观点”的争论： 为了消除对自治的所有怀疑，我想明确指出，自我生产并不意味着所有原因都位于系统内部；也不意味着这些原因中更重要的……或者甚至大部分原因都源自系统内部。尽管有相反的说法，但自我生产的法律系统受到社会、经济和政治因素的强烈影响。实际上，假定情况必然如此。然而，不同的是环境影响自我生产法律的方式。 此外，特布纳比卢曼对法律自主性的概念设定了更多的前提条件。他的目标是理解自主性和自组织，这是由程度区分的，而卢曼明确拒绝了这一点，因为操作上的闭环意味着自主性，关系自主性是不存在的。尽管卢曼在自组织转变之前曾使用过这一概念，他随后强烈地拒绝了它。这不过是失望的“激进马克思主义方法”的表达；“我们更喜欢一个由自组织概念支持的自主性概念，即明确说明自主性是否存在，不允许任何灰色地带。” 另一方面，特布纳希望仔细区分不同的自我参照维度。因此，他区分了七个自我参照时刻：（1）系统的自我观察，他将之称为（2）自我描述，当它相对永久并用于创建秩序时（法律学说）；然后是（3）自我组织，只有当系统拥有“次级规则”（H.L.A. 哈特）时才存在，即程序规则和识别合法性的规则；（4）自我调节作为自我组织的动态变体，当系统可以根据自己的标准进行改变时，因为它拥有改变法律的规范和程序。当自我调节和自我描述以这样一种方式结合在一起，以至于关于系统自身身份的论证背景出现时，这就是特布纳特别重要的（5）自我反思形式，例如法学理论。当系统自己创造其组成部分作为新兴单位时，可以谈论（6）自我生产，其中内部劳动在于“从事件流中提取和构建，将其用作新元素，然后通过选择性连接使用它们。”自我生产因此不是创造性虚无，而是从“物质基础结构”中提取单位，用它们构建系统。（7）自组织甚至要求更多，即所有系统组件（元素、结构、过程、边界、系统的身份和统一）都是自我生产的，另外这种自我生产周期能够维持自身。这意味着它与第二个周期相互联系，这个周期通过保证其生产条件来使循环生产成为可能。特布纳将这种再生产周期称为“超级循环”。 鉴于此背景，卢曼的概念更简单：当法律系统能够通过系统的操作自我再生产时，其统一性得以保持。要么成功——要么不成功；存在自组织——或不存在。另一方面，特布纳坚持一个渐进的过程，他将之理解为循环关系的累积增长。起初，法律沟通通过合法/非法的区分开始分化。然后，它们不可避免地在某个时刻遇到自身，并被迫使自己成为法律类别的主题。因此，法律依赖于用自己的类别描述其系统组成部分。它自己决定要满足哪些前提条件才能谈论法律相关事件。从自我参照性组织的系统组件相互联系的那一刻起，其自我再生产就成为可能，规范和法律行为相互产生，过程和理论反过来关联这些关系。“只有当循环组织的系统组件以这种方式相互作用时，法律超级循环才成为可能”。通过这种方式，特布纳得出法律系统发展自主性的三个阶段： 在“社会性模糊的法律”的初始阶段，法律话语的元素、结构、过程和界限与一般社会沟通的相同——或者，至少是由社会沟通异质性决定的。当法律话语开始定义自己的组成部分并操作使用它们时，法律进入了“部分自治”的阶段。只有当法律系统的组件以超级循环方式相互联系时，法律才变成“自组织”。 根据这个模型，当法律的自我描述发展并实践法律来源学说时，自组织才会出现。这一学说将规范的创造引用到法律内部的法律制定过程中，即在现代实证法中，“法律规范只能通过明确定义的法律行为产生，无论是法律、法令还是组织内行为。”因此，循环关系发展：法律只通过法官的行动成为有效，而法官反过来又必须通过法律论证其有效性。特布纳因此更详细地描述了法律沟通如何能够与法律沟通相连。卢曼不同意这种解释，并声称自己解释了法律系统的演化，尽管他承认“[这些论点]也受到了”特布纳的评论的影响。 2.2 悖论作为“无综合的辩证法” 悖论的管理可以被视为批判干预的入口——包括特布纳的理论。法律基于基本悖论。法律的九头蛇不断产生新的不可决定性。与关于不确定性的经常模糊的话语相反，系统理论能够更清楚地展示问题的深度。它能够显示，不可决定性不仅仅是偶然不充分的形式化的结果，而是源于一个根本悖论，一个社会系统的真正矛盾——正如特布纳在（同时与之保持距离）遵循马克思所阐述的。悖论不是对这些系统的智力重建中的简单错误。 特布纳因此认为，必须调查那些循环关系，这就是为什么他进行研究以解决法律实践如何处理它们，如何能够将完全的不确定性转变为相对的确定性和稳定性的问题。对悖论的批判性破坏潜力不是驱使他对悖论的认知兴趣；真正的迷惑在于“与它们一起工作的生产性可能性”。对于系统理论而言，由自我参照性产生的悖论不是最终点，而是出发点。与黑格尔的矛盾思维相反，悖论是“无综合的辩证法”，一种实验性的、渐进的、漫游的秩序创造，确实“意义的世界不断受到解构的困扰”，它们使社会关系跳舞——同时它又是“幻觉的情境”。去悖论化并不承诺危机的解决，“但最多只是它的暂时推迟、掩盖、隐形化、压抑、抑制。危机爆发只是时间问题。”"},{"instruction":"Opensource alternative to phantombuster","output":"If you're looking for an open-source alternative to PhantomBuster, a cloud-based automation and data scraping tool, you might want to consider these projects which share some functionalities with PhantomBuster.

Ozone can only absorb UV-B radiation, while O2 absorbs both UV-A and UV-B. - B. O3 has a higher molar mass than O2, making it naturally thicker and thus a better barrier. - C. The molecular structure of O3 allows for the absorption of UV photons that break the ozone molecule apart, a process not effective in O2. - D. O2 is primarily found in the lower atmosphere, thus it does not come into contact with UV radiation. **Correct Answer:** C. The molecular structure of O3 allows for the absorption of UV photons that break the ozone molecule apart, a process not effective in O2. **Edge Case Option:** A. Ozone can only absorb UV-B radiation, while O2 absorbs both UV-A and UV-B. **Explanation:** The correct answer is C because ozone absorbs UV-B radiation through its unique molecular structure, which allows UV photons to split the molecule apart, a process known as photodissociation. This process does not apply to diatomic oxygen (O2) as effectively because its molecular bonds are not as easily broken by UV-B photons. Option A is an edge case and a sophisticated distractor because it incorrectly specifies the types of UV radiation absorbed by O2 and O3, challenging the test taker to know the specific absorption properties of these molecules. 2. **MCQ:** At what altitude range does the ozone layer primarily exist? - A. 0 – 10 km above Earth’s surface - B. 10 – 30 km above Earth’s surface - C. 30 – 50 km above Earth’s surface - D. 50 – 70 km above Earth’s surface **Correct Answer:** B. 10 – 30 km above Earth’s surface **Edge Case Option:** C. 30 – 50 km above Earth’s surface **Explanation:** The correct answer is B because the ozone layer is primarily situated in the stratosphere, approximately 10-30 km above Earth's surface, where it absorbs the majority of the sun's harmful ultraviolet radiation. Option C is an edge case because there is a common misconception about the ozone layer's altitude, with some sources mistakenly extending its reach higher into the stratosphere, testing the nuanced understanding of its location. 3. **MCQ:** Which process is primarily responsible for the natural formation of ozone (O3) in the Earth's atmosphere? - A. Photosynthesis by terrestrial plants - B. The photodissociation of molecular oxygen (O2) by UV light followed by O2 reacting with atomic oxygen (O) - C. Combustion reactions in the troposphere - D. Lightning discharges in the atmosphere **Correct Answer:** B. The photodissociation of molecular oxygen (O2) by UV light followed by O2 reacting with atomic oxygen (O) **Edge Case Option:** D. Lightning discharges in the atmosphere **Explanation:** The primary process for natural ozone formation is through the photodissociation of molecular oxygen (O2) by ultraviolet (UV) light to create atomic oxygen (O), which then recombines with O2 to form ozone (O3). This process is correctly described in option B. Option D is an edge case because while lightning can produce ozone, it is not the primary natural source of atmospheric ozone. This option tests the understanding that ozone production can occur through different mechanisms but highlights the major process. 4. **MCQ:** Which factor most significantly contributes to the seasonal fluctuation of the ozone layer's thickness? - A. The angle of the sun’s rays - B. Variations in industrial pollution - C. The Earth's magnetic field variations - D. Changes in ocean currents **Correct Answer:** A. The angle of the sun’s rays **Edge Case Option:** B. Variations in industrial pollution **Explanation:** The thickness of the ozone layer fluctuates seasonally primarily due to the angle of the sun's rays, which impacts the intensity of UV radiation and consequently the rate of ozone formation and destruction in the atmosphere; thus, A is correct. While industrial pollution significantly impacts the ozone layer by contributing to its depletion, its influence as described in option B does not account for regular seasonal fluctuations, making it an edge case by challenging the distinction between long-term depletion and short-term seasonal variation. 5. **MCQ:** What outcome results from the interaction between chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and ozone in the stratosphere? - A. Formation of additional ozone molecules - B. Conversion of CFCs into harmless water vapor - C. Destruction of ozone molecules and release of chlorine atoms - D. Stabilization of the ozone layer by reflecting UV rays back into space **Correct Answer:** C. Destruction of ozone molecules and release of chlorine atoms **Edge Case Option:** D. Stabilization of the ozone layer by reflecting UV rays back into space **Explanation:** The interaction between chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and ozone in the stratosphere leads to the destruction of ozone molecules and the release of chlorine atoms (Option C), a process that significantly depletes the ozone layer. Option D serves as an edge case by presenting a plausible-sounding but incorrect scenario where CFCs would have a protective role rather than a harmful one, testing the depth of understanding regarding the impact of CFCs on the ozone layer."},{"instruction":"I want you to act as an expert in creating edge-case multiple-choice questions (MCQs) that challenge the understanding of complex concepts.

The density of stratospheric clouds. - B. The intensity of solar UV radiation reaching the stratosphere. - C. The global average temperature at sea level. - D. The concentration of industrial gases other than chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). **Correct Answer:** B. The intensity of solar UV radiation reaching the stratosphere. **Edge Case Option:** A. The density of stratospheric clouds. **Explanation:** The intensity of solar UV radiation reaching the stratosphere is directly responsible for the photodissociation of molecular oxygen, which is the initial step in natural ozone regeneration, making B the correct answer. Option A is an edge case option because, while stratospheric clouds can influence the distribution and density of ozone by affecting temperature and thereby reaction rates, their role is not as direct or significant as the UV radiation itself in controlling the regeneration rate of ozone. 2. **MCQ:** In the context of ozone depletion, how do chlorine atoms (from CFCs) act differently from oxygen atoms (from O2) in the ozone-oxygen cycle in the stratosphere? - A. Chlorine atoms only interact with oxygen atoms, not ozone molecules. - B. Unlike oxygen atoms, chlorine atoms act as a catalyst in breaking down ozone without being consumed. - C. Chlorine atoms convert more efficiently to ozone under UV light than oxygen atoms. - D. Oxygen atoms enhance the stability of the ozone layer, unlike chlorine atoms. **Correct Answer:** B. Unlike oxygen atoms, chlorine atoms act as a catalyst in breaking down ozone without being consumed. **Edge Case Option:** A. Chlorine atoms only interact with oxygen atoms, not ozone molecules. **Explanation:** Chlorine atoms, released from CFCs, act as a catalyst in the chemical reactions that break down ozone molecules, without being consumed in the process, which explains why even small amounts of chlorine can have a large impact on ozone depletion, making B the correct choice. Option A is sophisticatedly incorrect and an edge case because it suggests a misleading specificity about the reactions involving chlorine atoms, testing the understanding that chlorine atoms actually react with ozone molecules directly, as well as with atomic oxygen resulting from those reactions. 3. **MCQ:** Why does the ozone layer thickness vary seasonally, with a maximum during the spring and fall at higher latitudes? - A. Increased industrial pollution during winter months. - B. Higher UV radiation levels in the spring and fall promote ozone creation. - C. The angle and intensity of sun exposure vary, affecting the rate of ozone formation and destruction. - D. Ozone is transported from lower latitudes to higher latitudes. **Correct Answer:** C. The angle and intensity of sun exposure vary, affecting the rate of ozone formation and destruction. **Edge Case Option:** D. Ozone is transported from lower latitudes to higher latitudes. **Explanation:** The seasonal variation in the thickness of the ozone layer, with peaks in spring and autumn, can be attributed to the complex interplay of the angle and intensity of sun exposure, which affects both the rates of ozone formation and its destruction. Option C accurately captures these dynamics. Option D is an edge case as it points toward a correct, but less direct, process where atmospheric circulation patterns can indeed transport ozone, thereby affecting its distribution, yet this process is not the primary reason for seasonal variation at high latitudes. 4. **MCQ:** What role does the temperature of the stratosphere play in the formation and depletion of the ozone layer? - A. Warmer temperatures increase the rate of ozone formation exponentially. - B. Colder temperatures facilitate the formation of polar stratospheric clouds that play a role in ozone depletion. - C. There is no significant temperature effect on ozone chemistry. - D. Warmer temperatures directly decrease industrial emissions of ozone-depleting substances. **Correct Answer:** B. Colder temperatures facilitate the formation of polar stratospheric clouds that play a role in ozone depletion. **Edge Case Option:** A. Warmer temperatures increase the rate of ozone formation exponentially. **Explanation:** Colder temperatures in the stratosphere lead to the formation of polar stratospheric clouds, which provide a surface for chlorine and bromine-catalyzed reactions that deplete ozone, making B the correct answer. Option A represents an edge case that tests understanding of generic chemical reaction rates with temperature, which might seem applicable since many reaction rates increase with temperature. However, in the context of ozone chemistry, the specific catalyst-driven reactions on the surface of polar stratospheric clouds at colder temperatures are more directly relevant. 5. **MCQ:** Reflecting on the recovery of the ozone layer following the implementation of the Montreal Protocol, which of the following statements is most accurate? - A. The ozone layer is expected to fully recover to pre-1980 levels by 2050 due to the complete cessation of all CFC emissions. - B. Ongoing global warming has accelerated the recovery of the ozone layer by increasing stratospheric temperatures. - C. Despite reduced CFC emissions, unexpected sources of ozone-depleting substances have been identified, potentially delaying recovery. - D. The Montreal Protocol only minimally impacted ozone recovery, as natural variations are the predominant factor in ozone layer thickness. **Correct Answer:** C. Despite reduced CFC emissions, unexpected sources of ozone-depleting substances have been identified, potentially delaying recovery. **Edge Case Option:** B. Ongoing global warming has accelerated the recovery of the ozone layer by increasing stratospheric temperatures. **Explanation:** The statement in C is correct, noting that while the Montreal Protocol significantly reduced emissions of many ozone-depleting substances, unexpected emissions of some of these substances have been detected in recent years, potentially complicating the recovery timeline. Option B presents an enticing misconstrual; while global warming affects many aspects of Earth's climate system, its direct role in accelerating the chemical recovery of the ozone layer is not supported by current scientific consensus, making it an effectively challenging edge case by invoking the complex interplay between global warming and ozone layer dynamics."},{"instruction":"Какие заинтересованные стороны в проекте по теме создание чат-бота для психологической помощи студентам","output":"1.

This task typically involves filtering the reference field to display only relevant options based on the current user's location attribute. Here's a basic approach on how you might achieve this: # 1. Determine User Location First, you'd ascertain the current user's location. This information could be stored in the User [sys_user] table or a related table, depending on your ServiceNow configuration. # 2. Filter Reference Field Options Next, you'd use this location information to filter the options in your reference field. There are a few ways to do this, but one common method is to use a reference qualifier. Using a Reference Qualifier: - **Dynamic Reference Qualifier:** Create a Script Include that returns an encoded query based on the user's location. Then, set the reference qualifier of the reference field to use this Script Include. # Example Approach: Script Include (Server-side): Create a Script Include named \`LocationBasedRefQual\`: \`\`\`javascript var LocationBasedRefQual = Class.create(); LocationBasedRefQual.prototype = { initialize: function() { }, // Function to get encoded query based on user's location getQueryForUserLocation: function(userId) { var userLocation = \\"\\"; // Logic to get user location based on userId var query = \\"location=\\" + userLocation; // Modify to match your actual query return query; } }; \`\`\` Update the \`getQueryForUserLocation\` method to correctly fetch the user's location and create an appropriate encoded query for the reference field. Client Script (Client-side): In some scenarios, you might need to manipulate the reference field options on the client side, especially if the filtering needs to be dynamic based on client-side interactions. \`\`\`javascript function onChange(control, oldValue, newValue, isLoading, isTemplate) { if (isLoading || newValue === '') { return; } // Assuming \\"user_location_field\\" is the name of the Reference Field var userLocation = g_user.location; // Fetch current user location var refQual = 'location=' + userLocation; // Modify your query accordingly g_form.getReference('user_location_field', null).setAttribute('ref_qual_elements', refQual); } \`\`\` # Note: - The actual implementation may vary based on your specific ServiceNow version and configuration, including location attributes and how data is structured in your instance. - You may need to adjust the logic to fit your exact requirements, like fetching the user location and applying the correct query. - Test your scripts thoroughly in a sub-production instance before deploying them in your production environment to prevent any unexpected issues. This approach provides a flexible way to dynamically adjust Reference field options based on user attributes such as location, enhancing user experience and data relevance in your ServiceNow instance."},{"instruction":"give clear explanation","output":"To dynamically remove options from a reference field in ServiceNow based on the user's location, we need to consider two primary steps. First is determining the user's location, and second is filtering the reference field options based on that location. For this task, we predominantly use scripting, and the implementation can slightly vary depending on your specific requirements and ServiceNow setup. # Step 1: Determine User Location In ServiceNow, every user has a profile in the User [sys_user] table, which can include location details if configured in your system. This location information is what you'd use to filter reference field options. # Step 2: Filter Reference Field Options Using a Reference Qualifier A Reference Qualifier is used in ServiceNow to filter the entries presented in a reference field. You can create a dynamic reference qualifier by using a Script Include. A Script Include is a server-side script that allows you to write reusable JavaScript code. Script Include: 1. **Create a Script Include:** This Script Include will contain a function that generates an encoded query string based on the user's location. This query string is used to filter the options of your reference field. 2. **Example of a Script Include:** \`\`\`javascript var UserLocationFilter = Class.create(); UserLocationFilter.prototype = { initialize: function() { }, // Function to generate encoded query for reference field based on user's location getRefQual: function(userId) { var userGR = new GlideRecord('sys_user'); if (userGR.get(userId)) { var userLocation = userGR.location; // Assuming you want to filter records having the same location as the user return \\"location=\\" + userLocation; } return \\"\\"; // return an empty string if no specific location is found }, type: 'UserLocationFilter' }; \`\`\` **Note:** You must replace \`\\"location=\\" + userLocation\` with the actual field and logic that matches your requirements. Reference Qualifier: For the reference field you wish to filter based on the user location, set the reference qualifier to use a dynamic filter. In the field's properties, you can specify to use a dynamic reference qualifier and call the Script Include you've created. This is done in the reference field configuration in the ServiceNow table schema: - **Type:** Use Dynamic - **Script:** \`new UserLocationFilter().getRefQual(gs.getUserID())\` # Additional Considerations: - **Client-side Filtering:** If your use case requires filtering options based on client-side actions (e.g., changes to a form field without submitting the form), you might implement Client Scripts. However, since client scripts run on the user's browser, they don't directly modify server-side reference qualifiers but can manipulate which options are shown or hidden based on client-side logic. - **Testing:** Always test your implementation in a development or sandbox environment before deploying it in production to ensure it meets your needs and functions as expected across different scenarios. - **Documentation:** ServiceNow provides extensive documentation and community forums where developers share solutions. If you encounter specific issues, these resources can be very helpful. Remember, the exact implementation details can vary based on your ServiceNow setup and version. Always refer to the latest ServiceNow documentation for the most current practices and script APIs."},{"instruction":"We have the requirement of encrypt the users’s input when they reject a request and write a justification in the spModal from Employee Center Approval page, it’s possible to encrypt this justification as a password field, not encrypted in the db, it’s more like when you are typing the comment in the spModal that it’s displayed when a user is rejecting the request.","output":"Encrypting user input in real-time within an \`spModal\` in the ServiceNow Employee Center (or Service Portal) as they type—similar to a password field hiding characters—does not directly relate to database encryption but more to UI behavior modification. The goal here is to mask input for privacy reasons while the user is entering it, before it gets submitted or stored. To achieve this, you'd typically modify the input type of the text area or input field within the \`spModal\` to be of type \\"password.\\" This change ensures that the input is masked as the user types their justification for rejecting a request. Here is a step-by-step approach to achieve this in a ServiceNow Service Portal \`spModal\`: # 1. Customizing the \`spModal\` Instance When you create or customize an \`spModal\`, specify the input field for the justification as a password field. This is not standard functionality for a justification input (which would typically be a text area), so you would need to customize this part. \`\`\`javascript // Example of launching an spModal with a password field spModal.open({ title: 'Reject Justification', message: 'Please enter your justification for rejection:', inputType: 'password', // Setting inputType to password to mask input buttons: [ {label: 'Submit', value: true}, {label: 'Cancel', value: false} ], callback: function(result) { // Callback function to handle the submission if (result) { var justification = result; // result contains the masked/encrypted justification // Proceed with any action after receiving the justification } } }); \`\`\` # 2. Implementing the Solution Since this might not be straightforward for multi-line text areas (used commonly for justifications or comments), you would typically use a single-line input of type \\"password.\\" This limits the ability to review the full text easily, which might not be ideal for longer text but is suitable for masking the input. For longer justifications requiring multi-line inputs, there's no direct HTML input equivalent to a multiline \`password\` field. To simulate this, you would need a more complex JavaScript-based solution that captures input, masks it in the display, and perhaps mirrors the input into a hidden field for submission. However, such an approach can be complex and may impact user experience. # 3. Security Note Remember, the purpose of this masking is user interface level privacy and does not equate to encrypting the data for secure storage or transmission. You would need to ensure secure handling of the data post-submission according to your security requirements. # 4. Potential Limitations - **User Experience:** Masking the entire justification might not offer the best user experience, especially if the user wants to review what they've typed before submitting. - **Functionality:** Standard multi-line comment or justification fields don’t support direct masking like password fields without custom coding. # Conclusion Masking input in an \`spModal\` in ServiceNow as described is feasible for single-line inputs by setting the input type to \\"password.\\" For a multi-line justification field, achieving a similar masking effect requires a more complex, custom JavaScript solution. Always consider the impact on user experience and the security implications of how data is handled after submission."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

不过，实现这样的功能在Java中是相对直接的。若你的目标是实现这样的字符串替换功能，可以通过编写一个简单的方法来实现，下面是一个简单的示例： \`\`\`java public class StringReplaceExample { public static void main(String[] args) { String template = \\"This is ?2 test for ?4 mechanism ?1 example ?3.\\"; Object[] values = {\\"an\\", \\"a\\", \\"replacement\\", \\"simple\\"}; String result = replacePlaceholders(template, values); System.out.println(result); } public

String replacement = (index >= 0 && index < values.length) ? values[index].toString() : matcher.group(0); matcher.appendReplacement(result, replacement); } matcher.appendTail(result); return result.toString(); } } \`\`\` 这段代码中，\`replacePlaceholders\`方法接受一个按照特定格式（如\`?1\`，\`?2\`等占位符）定义的模板字符串和一个包含替换值的数组，然后用这些值替换模板字符串中的占位符。使用Java的正则表达式（\`Pattern\`和\`Matcher\`类）来查找模板字符串中所有符合格式的占位符，并用对应的数组元素替换它们。需要注意的是，这个实现考虑了数组索引越界的情况，并保留了原有的占位符。 不过，如果你在处理数据库相关的操作，可能你看到的\`?2\`，\`?4\`这样的占位符是在JDBC的\`PreparedStatement\`中，那种情况下，这些占位符实际上是用于防止SQL注入，提供参数化查询的，而不是用于字符串替换的。在Spring框架中，特别是在使用JdbcTemplate或者Spring Data

请注意，@Around注解中使用的\`@annotation(myAnnotation)\`表达式。这意味着Spring AOP将为所有使用\`@MyAnnotation\`注解的方法调用此Advice，并且\`myAnnotation\`参数将被自动填充为目标方法上的\`@MyAnnotation\`实例，从而允许您在Advice内部访问注解的属性。 **确保您的应用被配置为启用AOP代理**, 通常是在Spring配置文件或启动类上添加\`@EnableAspectJAutoProxy\`。 \`\`\`java @Configuration @EnableAspectJAutoProxy public class AppConfig { } \`\`\` 或者，如果您使用Spring Boot，通常只需通过添加依赖和使用\`@SpringBootApplication\`来自动配置。

在您的通知方法中，首先使用\`JoinPoint\`或\`ProceedingJoinPoint\`（对于\`@Around\`通知）来获取方法参数，然后通过参数索引或循环检查来找到您想要的参数。请注意，这种方式不依赖于参数名称，是通过参数位置或类型来访问的。 \`\`\`java @Around(\\"execution(* com.yourpackage..*(..))\\") //

如果\`influxFluxQuery\`参数是被某个注解标记的（例如，当处理Web请求参数时），您可以通过该注解拦截具有此参数的方法。但是，这通常用于处理特定的参数注解情况，如Spring MVC中的\`@RequestParam\`、\`@PathVariable\`等。例如： \`\`\`java

如果您的需求是根据参数类型进行操作，那么方法一是最直接的选择。如果是特殊场景，其中参数具有注解，您可能需要针对特定场景寻找解决方案。 综上所述，如果错误是由于尝试直接通过参数名“influxFluxQuery”来绑定导致的，那么需要调整您的方法，转而使用支持的方式来访问参数，如上述方法一所示。希望这样直接回答了您的问题。"},{"instruction":"spring能获取方法返回List<Point>，的Point的class吗","output":"在Spring框架中，获取到具体方法返回的泛型类型，如\`List<Point>\`中的\`Point\`，通常不是一个直接且简单的任务。Java泛型因类型擦除（Type

如果您有方法定义的控制权，可以通过添加注解来保留泛型类型信息。例如，您可以自定义一个注解来明确标记方法返回的具体类型： \`\`\`java @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME) @Target(ElementType.METHOD) public @interface ReturnType { Class<?> value(); } \`\`\` 然后在方法上使用这个注解： \`\`\`java @ReturnType(value = Point.class) public List<Point> getPoints() { return new ArrayList<Point>(); } \`\`\` 您可以在运行时通过反射来访问这个注解，从而获取到\`Point\`类型信息： \`\`\`java Method method = ...

AOP（面向切面编程）来生成代理类，这在很大程度上简化了代理类的生成和管理。Spring AOP默认使用JDK动态代理或CGLIB来创建代理，选择哪种方式主要取决于目标对象是否实现了接口。 默认情况下，如果目标对象实现了至少一个接口，Spring AOP会使用JDK动态代理；如果目标对象没有实现任何接口，则使用CGLIB。 要在Spring中强制使用CGLIB代理（即使目标对象实现了接口），可以通过配置\`@EnableAspectJAutoProxy\`注解的\`proxyTargetClass\`属性为\`true\`。这可以确保Spring AOP使用CGLIB代理，而不是JDK动态代理。 \`\`\`java @Configuration @EnableAspectJAutoProxy(proxyTargetClass = true) // 强制使用CGLIB代理 public class AppConfig { } \`\`\` 对于直接使用CGLIB而不通过Spring AOP的场景，你需要直接使用CGLIB库。以下是一个简单的示例，演示如何使用CGLIB库直接生成一个简单Java类的代理： 首先，确保你的项目中加入了CGLIB依赖。如果你使用的是Maven，可以在\`pom.xml\`中加入： \`\`\`xml <dependency> <groupId>org.springframework</groupId> <artifactId>spring-core</artifactId> <version>你的Spring版本</version> </dependency> \`\`\` 注意：Spring的\`spring-core\`库已经包括了CGLIB，因此不需要额外添加CGLIB库。 然后，你可以这样使用CGLIB来生成代理： \`\`\`java import org.springframework.cglib.proxy.Enhancer; import org.springframework.cglib.proxy.FixedValue; public class CglibDemo { public static void main(String[] args) { Enhancer enhancer = new Enhancer(); enhancer.setSuperclass(MyClass.class); // MyClass是你想要代理的类 enhancer.setCallback((FixedValue) () -> \\"Hello Cglib\\"); // 这里简单地为所有方法返回相同的字符串 MyClass myClassProxy = (MyClass) enhancer.create(); System.out.println(myClassProxy.myMethod()); // 调用代理对象的方法 } public static class MyClass { public String myMethod() { return \\"Original method call\\"; } } } \`\`\` 这个简单的示例演示了如何使用CGLIB创建\`MyClass\`的代理类，其中所有方法调用都返回相同的字符串。这里，\`FixedValue\`只是\`org.springframework.cglib.proxy.Callback\`接口实现之一，用于拦截对代理对象的所有方法调用。 请注意，直接使用CGLIB相对较底层，Spring AOP为常见代理和拦截模式提供了更高级别的抽象。如果你的目的是在Spring环境中使用代理进行AOP，建议使用Spring AOP和其提供的注解和配置方式，这样可以更容易地维护和集成。"},{"instruction":"我的意思是，我定义一个接口，在方法上写注解，然后spring启动的时候，注入我通过注解自定义的代理bean（继承这个接口，然后按照注解生成方法），这样我就可以在其他地方注入这个接口，但实际上是用的我注入spring容器的代理类","output":"明白你的需求了，你想定义一个接口并在其方法上应用自定义注解，然后在Spring容器启动时动态地创建这个接口的代理实现，并将这个代理实现注入到Spring容器中。当你在应用的其他地方注入这个接口时，Spring实际上会注入这个代理实现。这种模式类似于Spring Cloud Feign客户端或是Spring Data Repository的工作方式。 要实现这样的功能，你可以利用Spring的\`FactoryBean\`、\`BeanDefinitionRegistryPostProcessor\`以及CGLIB代理（或者根据需要选择其他代理技术）。下面是一个简化的实现示例： # 1. 定义你的接口和自定义注解 首先，定义一个简单的接口以及一个自定义注解，用于在接口的方法上标记和提供一些元数据。 \`\`\`java public interface MyServiceInterface { @MyCustomAnnotation String process(String input); } @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME) @Target(ElementType.METHOD) public @interface MyCustomAnnotation { // 定义你需要的属性 } \`\`\` # 2. 创建一个代理类生成器 接着，创建一个类用于基于你的接口和注解生成代理实现。在这个例子中，使用CGLIB来动态生成实现： \`\`\`java public class MyServiceInterfaceProxy implements MethodInterceptor { @Override public Object intercept(Object obj, Method method, Object[] args, MethodProxy proxy) throws Throwable { // 在这里实现你的代理逻辑，例如根据方法注解来动态改变行为 if (method.isAnnotationPresent(MyCustomAnnotation.class)) { // 示例逻辑：打印一个消息，然后调用原方法 System.out.println(\\"MyCustomAnnotation is present, doing something special.\\"); } return \\"Proxy: \\" + args[0]; // 示例返回 } public static Object createProxy(Class<?> targetClass) { Enhancer enhancer = new Enhancer(); enhancer.setSuperclass(targetClass); enhancer.setCallback(new MyServiceInterfaceProxy()); return enhancer.create(); } } \`\`\` # 3. 注册代理实现到Spring容器 现在，你需要在Spring容器中注册这个代理实现。一种方式是使用\`BeanDefinitionRegistryPostProcessor\`来动态注册Bean定义： \`\`\`java @Component public class MyServiceInterfaceRegistrar implements BeanDefinitionRegistryPostProcessor, ApplicationContextAware { private ApplicationContext applicationContext; @Override public void postProcessBeanDefinitionRegistry(BeanDefinitionRegistry registry) throws BeansException { Object proxy = MyServiceInterfaceProxy.createProxy(MyServiceInterface.class); // 注册代理Bean registry.registerBeanDefinition(\\"myServiceInterfaceProxy\\",

throws BeansException { // 通常不需要在这个方法中实现逻辑 } @Override public void setApplicationContext(ApplicationContext applicationContext) throws BeansException { this.applicationContext = applicationContext; } } \`\`\` 通过以上步骤，\`MyServiceInterface.class\`的代理实现会被创建并注册到Spring容器中。你可以在应用的其他地方通过@Autowired来注入\`MyServiceInterface\`，Spring会提供这个代理实现。 # 注意 这个实现是非常基础和简化的，仅为了演示基本概念。在真实的应用中，你可能需要对此进行扩展和调整，例如支持方法级的代理逻辑、与Spring AOP集成、考虑事务等。另外，根据你的需求，可能还需要处理接口中的默认方法、处理特殊的返回类型等复杂的场景。 这种模式在创建像是Feign客户端、Spring Data Repositories或其他需要基于接口动态创建实现的情况下相当有用，但请记得这样会增加应用的复杂性，并且需要仔细管理Spring的Bean生命周期。"},{"instruction":"对实现了某一接口的所有接口都做这种代理","output":"要对实现了某一特定接口的所有接口实现进行代理，你可以采用稍微不同的方法。这个过程涉及到在Spring应用上下文中查找所有实现了特定接口的bean，然后为他们生成代理并重新注册到Spring容器中。下面是一种实现此目标的方法：

\`\`\`java public class GenericProxyCreator { public static Object createProxy(Class<?> targetClass, Class<?> interfaceClass) { Enhancer enhancer = new Enhancer(); enhancer.setSuperclass(targetClass); enhancer.setInterfaces(new Class[] { interfaceClass }); enhancer.setCallback(new MethodInterceptor() { @Override public Object intercept(Object obj, Method method, Object[] args, MethodProxy proxy)

method.getName()); return result; } }); return enhancer.create(); } } \`\`\` # 3. 动态代理注册器实现 通过实现\`BeanPostProcessor\`接口，我们可以拦截Spring容器的bean初始化过程，在bean实例化之后，初始化之前插入我们的代理逻辑： \`\`\`java @Component public class ProxyBeanPostProcessor implements BeanPostProcessor, ApplicationContextAware { private ApplicationContext applicationContext; @Override public Object postProcessBeforeInitialization(Object bean, String beanName) throws BeansException { if (bean instanceof TargetInterface) { // 如果bean实现了TargetInterface接口，则为其创建代理 return GenericProxyCreator.createProxy(bean.getClass(), TargetInterface.class); } return bean; // 其他bean保持不变 } @Override public void setApplicationContext(ApplicationContext applicationContext) throws BeansException { this.applicationContext = applicationContext; } } \`\`\` 在这个\`ProxyBeanPostProcessor\`中，我们检查每个bean是否是\`TargetInterface\`的实例。如果是，我们就使用\`GenericProxyCreator.createProxy\`方法为其创建代理。这样，对于任何实现了\`TargetInterface\`接口的bean，Spring在初始化这些bean的时候都会自动用我们的代理对象替换它们的实例。 # 注意 - 通过使用\`BeanPostProcessor\`，我们可以确保Spring容器中所有实现了\`TargetInterface\`接口的bean都被代理，而无需显式注册每个代理bean。 - 如果你的代理逻辑非常特定（例如，依赖于特定注解或需要访问Spring容器中的其他bean），你可能需要在\`postProcessBeforeInitialization\`方法中添加更多逻辑来处理这些情况。 - 请注意，代理对象将替换原始bean的引用，这意味着Spring容器中其他地方对这些bean的引用也会使用代理对象。这可能对bean的预期行为有影响，特别是在涉及到继承、接口实现和类型检查时。确保你的代理逻辑不会意外改变bean的核心行为。 这种策略非常适合在运行时动态增强多个bean的行为，特别是当这些bean遵循通用接口或类继承结构时。通过对bean实例化过程的干预，我们可以在不修改原始代码的情况下注入自定义逻辑，这为应用的扩展和模块化提供了强大的灵活性。"},{"instruction":"我的接口没写spring注解，postProcessBeforeInitialization也能对接口扫描吗","output":"如果您的接口没有标记为Spring管理的组件（即，没有使用Spring的注解如\`@Component\`、\`@Service\`等），\`BeanPostProcessor\`

要达到这样的目标，可以考虑使用如下技术组合： 1. **自定义注解** - 用来标记接口方法，便于运行时通过代理实现逻辑。 2. **\`BeanFactoryPostProcessor\`** - 用于在Spring容器初始化过程中，动态注册代理bean。 3. **接口代理技术** - 使用Java的动态代理或CGLIB等生成代理实现。 这项需求的实现较为复杂，因为涉及到在Spring应用初始化阶段动态扫描接口、生成代理，并将这些代理注册为bean。下面提供一种可能的解决方案示例： # 步骤1: 定义自定义注解 首先，定义一个注解\`MyCustomMethodAnnotation\`，用于标记接口中需要特殊处理的方法。 \`\`\`java @Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME) @Target(ElementType.METHOD) public @interface MyCustomMethodAnnotation { String value() default \\"\\"; } \`\`\` # 步骤2: 创建一个代理类生成器 该生成器使用Java的动态代理实现代理逻辑。 \`\`\`java import

method.getAnnotation(MyCustomMethodAnnotation.class).value()); return \\"Proxy response based on annotation\\"; } throw new UnsupportedOperationException(\\"Method without annotation not supported\\"); } }); } } \`\`\` # 步骤3: 动态注册代理bean 使用\`BeanFactoryPostProcessor\`来动态扫描指定的接口、生成代理，并注册到Spring容器中。 \`\`\`java @Component public class ProxyBeanRegistrar implements BeanFactoryPostProcessor { @Override public void postProcessBeanFactory(ConfigurableListableBeanFactory beanFactory) throws BeansException { // 此处示例代码假定你已经能够以某种方式获取到所有目标接口类 Class<?>[] targetInterfaces = {/* 获取目标接口类 */}; for

DynamicProxyGenerator.createProxy((Class<BaseInterface>) targetInterface); beanFactory.registerSingleton(targetInterface.getName(), proxy); } } } } \`\`\` # 注意： - 在真实情况中，“获取目标接口类”可能需要用到类扫描库（如Spring的\`ClassPathScanningCandidateComponentProvider\`或其他第三方库）来在指定的包中查找所有实现了\`BaseInterface\`接口的接口。 - 请适当调整上面代码的错误处理逻辑，确保其满足你的具体需求。 - 这种方法依赖于在容器启动阶段注册代理实现，因此需要小心管理代理实例的生命周期。 通过上述方式，应用启动时会动态创建并注册接口的代理实现，这些实现将根据你的自定义注解来响应方法调用。这允许你在应用中的其他部分通过Spring正常注入这些接口，而实际使用的将是动态生成的代理实现。"},{"instruction":"// 此处示例代码假定你已经能够以某种方式获取到所有目标接口类

参数和返回值都是什么含义","output":"在CGLIB库中，\`MethodInterceptor\` 接口的 \`intercept\` 方法是实现方法拦截的关键。这个方法在代理对象上的每次方法调用时都会被触发。让我们逐个了解 \`intercept\` 方法的参数和返回值的含义： # 参数 - \`Object obj\`：这是代理对象实例本身，即方法调用的\\"this\\"引用。它允许你在\`intercept\`方法内部访问到正在被代理的对象。 - \`Method method\`：这是被调用的原始方法的\`java.lang.reflect.Method\`实例。通过这个参数，你可以获取方法的各种元数据（如方法名、参数类型、注解等），并根据它来决定拦截逻辑。 - \`Object[] args\`：这是一个包含了方法调用时传递给方法的所有参数的数组。这让你有机会在调用原始方法前修改、替换或添加新的参数值。 - \`MethodProxy proxy\`：这是一个由CGLIB生成的用于代理方法调用的对象。与直接使用反射调用\`method.invoke()\`不同，\`proxy.invokeSuper(obj, args)\`提供了一种更高效的方式来调用原始方法（即没有被拦截的方法）。它是专门为每个被代理的方法生成的，因此调用效率比使用标准Java反射更高。 # 返回值 - \`Object\`：\`intercept\` 方法的返回值类型为 \`Object\`，这意味着它可以返回任意类型的对象。这个返回值将会被返回给调用代理对象方法的调用者。因此，这个返回值应该与原始方法签名的返回类型兼容，否则可能导致 \`ClassCastException\`。 # 使用示例 在\`intercept\`方法内部，你可以基于\`method\`参数的信息（比如方法名、注解等）来执行不同的逻辑分支。通常，你可能会执行以下一种或多种操作： 1. **修改输入参数**：在调用原始方法之前修改\`args\`数组中的值。 2. **替换方法实现**：完全替换掉原始方法的逻辑，返回一个自定义的结果。 3. **在方法前后执行额外逻辑**：在调用原始方法前后，执行一些附加操作（比如日志记录、权限检查等）。 4. **调用原始方法**：通过\`proxy.invokeSuper(obj, args)\`调用原始方法，并根据需要处理或转换结果。 5. **阻塞方法调用**：在某些情况下，你可能决定不调用原始方法，而是直接返回一个固定的值或抛出异常。 这种拦截机制为在运行时动态修改对象的行为提供了极大的灵活性和强大的控制能力。"},{"instruction":"如果是通过接口实现的代理，return method.invoke(obj,

**错误的调用对象（\`obj\`）**：在CGLIB代理的\`MethodInterceptor\`中，\`obj\`是代理对象，而不是被代理的原始对象。在尝试用反射调用接口方法时（即使用\`method.invoke(obj, args)\`），由于\`obj\`实际是一个代理对象，没有直接的实现体，这将导致\`java.lang.IllegalArgumentException\`或其他错误，因为接口方法没有具体的实现可以被调用。 2. **接口方法没有直接实现**：由于\`obj\`指向的是一个CGLIB生成的代理对象，而不是具体的实现实例，接口上的方法实际上没有一个\\"直接\\"的实现可以通过反射调用。这意味着\`method.invoke(obj, args)\`试图在一个没有实现的接口上执行操作，这在逻辑上是不成立的。 # 解决办法 对于接口方法的代理，并希望能够在调用时执行某些特定逻辑，您应该直接在\`MethodInterceptor\`的\`intercept\`方法中实现这些逻辑，而不是尝试使用\`method.invoke(obj, args)\`来调用原始方法。 例如，您可以根据方法名、方法参数等条件来判断并执行不同的自定义逻辑： \`\`\`java @Override public Object intercept(Object obj, Method method, Object[] args, MethodProxy proxy) throws Throwable { if (\\"someMethod\\".equals(method.getName())) { // 对特定方法执行自定义逻辑 System.out.println(\\"执行 someMethod 的逻辑\\");

通过这种方式，您直接控制了对代理方法的调用，可以根据实际需要在其中实现逻辑，而不是试图调用实际的接口方法实现（因为实际上并不存在实现）。 总之，当使用CGLIB或其他代理技术对接口进行代理时，应避免试图通过反射直接调用接口方法，而是应该直接在代理的拦截器或处理器中实现所需的逻辑。这种方式更加灵活并且不依赖于接口方法的实际实现，因为在代理场景下这些实现可能根本就不存在。"},{"instruction":"ClassPathScanningCandidateComponentProvider provider = new

\`new AssignableTypeFilter(InfluxApi.class)\` 时，你告诉它查找所有可分配给 \`InfluxApi\` 类型的类。如果 \`InfluxApi\` 是一个接口，并且你期望扫描到实现了这个接口的其他接口，这将不起作用，因为默认情况下 Spring 的扫描是不包含接口的—Spring主要关注于能够实例化为bean的具体类。

一个解决方案是自己编写代码来进行更直接的类路径扫描和分析，或者使用一些已经存在的库，如\`org.reflections:reflections\`库，它可以帮助你找到所有实现了给定接口的接口和类。例如，使用Reflections库： \`\`\`java Reflections reflections = new Reflections(new ConfigurationBuilder()

// 处理默认方法 final Class<?> declaringClass = method.getDeclaringClass(); MethodHandles.Lookup lookup = MethodHandles.privateLookupIn(declaringClass, MethodHandles.lookup()); MethodHandle handle = lookup.unreflectSpecial(method, declaringClass).bindTo(proxy); return handle.invokeWithArguments(args1); } // 处理非默认方法 return proxy.invokeSuper(obj, args1); }; MyInterface proxy = createCglibProxy(MyInterface.class, interceptor); proxy.defaultMethod(); } } \`\`\` # 注意事项 1.

下面的代码行出现了问题： \`\`\`java MethodHandle handle = lookup.unreflectSpecial(method, declaringClass).bindTo(proxy); \`\`\` 这里\`proxy\`应该是要绑定的目标对象实例，但由于是在CGLIB代理环境下，我们实际上没有一个实现了接口的\\"真实\\"对象实例传递给\`bindTo\`方法。这个问题的根源在于尝试直接操作接口默认方法的调用。正常情况下，接口默认方法的调用需要具体的实现类实例进行操作，而在CGLIB代理场景下，可能导致混淆。

问题的根源在于\`MethodProxy\`对象无法直接用于调用接口的默认方法。针对此，需要调整的关键是如何正确地使用\`MethodHandles\`来调用默认方法： # 步骤1：修正绑定对象的引用 您需要保证能够获取到正确的调用对象实例（对于接口默认方法，理论上不需要实例，但需要正确的类型引用）。但在这种情况下，如果接口方法是默认方法，并且我们需要对其进行特殊处理，我们实际上不能直接在CGLIB的\`intercept\`方法中调用它，因为那里没有具体的实现实例参与。为了绕过这一点，考虑以下改进： # 调整代码以避免\`ClassCastException\`： \`\`\`java

上面的做法是基于您当前问提（使用CGLIB代理且需要绕过接口默认方法），做出的一种可行的改进。然而，对于一般的使用情况，如无特殊需要，考虑使用更自然支持接口代理的JDK动态代理或调整应用设计以避免这种复杂的场景，往往会是更佳选择。希望这能帮到您，如果还有其他问题或疑问，请继续提问。"},{"instruction":"cglib创建对象时，可否获取方法返回List里的具体类型","output":"在Java中，由于类型擦除（Type Erasure），泛型信息在运行时并不会被保留。这意味着，当你在运行时使用Reflection API（反射API）去检查一个类或方法时，你通常无法直接获取到泛型参数的具体类型，例如，一个方法返回\`List<String>\`类型，在运行时你只能知道这是一个\`List\`，但无法知道这个\`List\`里面装的是\`String\`类型的元素。 但是，有一种例外情况，那就是当泛型类型被用作类、接口或方法的成员时，通过Java的反射API可以通过\`getGenericReturnType\`方法获取到具体的泛型信息，这是因为这些信息被存储在类或方法的签名中。然而，这通常不适用于通过CGLIB或任何其他库动态创建的对象，因为这些动态代理或增强的类并不会在其方法签名中包含新的泛型信息。 如果你有一个方法，比如： \`\`\`java

对于通过CGLIB创建的代理对象，你仍然可以访问原始类的方法定义并使用类似上述方法来获取泛型信息，但对于代理对象自身的方法（假如这些方法是在运行时动态添加的），泛型信息可能不可用，因为动态生成的代理类的方法不会包含Java源代码中声明的泛型信息。"},{"instruction":"除了使用--add-opens java.base/java.lang=ALL-UNNAMED

不过，您可以考虑以下几种方法来规遍或缓解这种限制： # 1. 更新库版本 确保您使用的库（如CGLIB、Spring等）是最新的，或者确认它们支持Java 9及以上版本。随着时间的推移，许多库都已经发布了更新版本，以解决Java模块系统带来的问题。 # 2. 使用JDK动态代理代替CGLIB JDK提供了自己的动态代理机制，可以用来创建接口的代理实现。如果您代理的目标主要是接口而非类，那么JDK动态代理可以作为CGLIB的替代，而且不受\`--add-opens\`限制的影响。JDK动态代理的限制是它只能代理接口。 \`\`\`java YourInterface proxy = (YourInterface) Proxy.newProxyInstance( YourInterface.class.getClassLoader(), new Class<?>[] { YourInterface.class }, (proxy, method, args) -> { // 实现您的方法拦截逻辑 return null; }); \`\`\` # 3. 考虑使用字节码编程 如果CGLIB和JDK动态代理都不适合您的需求，另一种选择是直接使用字节码操作库，如ASM。ASM等库提供了底层的字节码操作能力，可以帮助您绕过一些通过反射引起的模块化问题，但这会大幅增加复杂度。 # 4. 使用反射的替代技术 对于某些特定场景，您可能通过使用变通的方法来避免直接反射调用受限的核心API。例如，利用Java的服务加载机制\`ServiceLoader\`或考虑其他设计模式，如工厂模式、策略模式等来减少对反射的依赖。 # 5. 调整JVM参数（不推荐） 虽然这不是去除\`--add-opens\`的方法，但改变运行时参数以避免JVM退出可以适用于测试环境或非生产环境。如极端情况下，压缩指针（Compressed Oops）特性也可能与特定的类加载行为相关联，可尝试调整此类JVM参数。 # 总结 虽然\`--add-opens\`参数有其存在的必要性，但通过上述方法，尤其是更新库版本和选择合适的代理机制，通常可以减少直接处理这一问题的需要。不过，必须注意的是，每一种方法都需要根据具体情况和需求仔细评估其适用性和潜在的影响。"},{"instruction":"使用JDK生成代理，然后用MethodInterceptor拦截方法，能实现吗","output":"使用JDK动态代理与CGLIB的\`MethodInterceptor\`结合在技术实现上有所冲突，因为它们各自属于Java代理机制的不同实现和应用。

CGLIB是另一个代理机制，主要用于类的代理，与JDK动态代理不同的是，CGLIB不要求被代理的对象必须实现接口。在CGLIB中，使用\`MethodInterceptor\`来拦截方法调用。 示例： \`\`\`java import net.sf.cglib.proxy.Enhancer; import net.sf.cglib.proxy.MethodInterceptor; public

(MyClass) enhancer.create(); // 创建代理对象 proxy.myMethod(); // 调用代理对象上的方法 } } \`\`\` # 结论 你不能直接在JDK动态代理中使用CGLIB的\`MethodInterceptor\`，因为JDK动态代理使用的是\`InvocationHandler\`机制。两者虽然都可以实现方法拦截的功能，但它们各自适用于不同的场景和需求（接口vs.类），并且使用的API和设计理念不同。需要根据你的具体需求选择最适合的代理机制。如果你的目标主要是代理接口而不是类，并且想要在方法调用时进行拦截，那么应该使用JDK动态代理和\`InvocationHandler\`。"},{"instruction":"influxdb

# 1. **数据写入性能** - 如果数据批量写入的间隔过长，或者写入速度无法跟上数据产生的速率，可能会导致数据在被查询前有延迟堆积在队列中，影响实时性。 - 写入数据时，合理的批量大小和高效的网络连接对于减少延迟至关重要。 # 2. **系统资源和配置** - InfluxDB服务器的CPU、内存和存储性能直接影响其处理写入和查询请求的能力。资源不足或配置不当可能导致处理速度下降，影响数据的实时获取和查询。 - InfluxDB的存储引擎（如TSM）高度依赖磁盘性能，故使用快速的SSD而非传统机械硬盘对实时性有明显帮助。 # 3. **查询优化** - 高效的查询设计对于取得良好的实时性能也非常重要。例如，避免查询大量的数据点，使用适当的时间范围和过滤条件可以减少查询延迟。 - 过多的连续查询或复杂的分析函数也可能导致服务器负载过高，进而影响实时性能。 # 4. **数据保留策略** - 数据保留策略（Retention Policies, RPs）决定数据存储的时长。合理配置可以避免数据库因为积累过多旧数据而导致性能下降。 -

幂等性是指无论操作执行多少次结果都保持不变的特性。对于InfluxDB而言，考虑到数据模型（时间戳+标签+字段），在相同时间戳内： - 如果标签集合和字段键完全相同，**最后一次写入的字段值会覆盖前一次的字段值**。 - 如果标签集合和字段键的组合是唯一的，每次写入都会被视为**不同的数据点**。 # 场景详解 - **相同时间戳，相同标签和字段键，不同字段值**：后一次写入会覆盖前一次的值，这种覆盖实际上反映了最后一次写入操作的结果。 - **相同时间戳，相同标签和字段键，相同字段值**：后一次写入在逻辑上与数据库中的状态相同，因此可以认为是幂等的，不改变数据库的状态。 # 注意事项 - 虽然这种行为确保了在特定情况下写入操作的幂等性，**但并不意味着在所有场景下写入都不会导致数据集变化**。例如，有不同时间戳或不同标签集的写入操作会增加新的数据点。 - 而对于某些特殊情况，如使用InfluxDB中的\`to()\`函数进行数据复制操作，或者在特定配置下执行批量写入，需要特别注意操作的幂等特性及其可能的影响。 总之，确实，InfluxDB的一些写入模式表现出了幂等性质，但是理解和应用这一特性时，必须详细考虑具体的数据模型和写入场景。在进行数据导入或同步等场景设计时，幂等性是一个非常重要的属性，可以帮助减少重复数据和避免数据不一致的问题。"},{"instruction":"mongodb是怎么解决读一致性问题的，写一致性用的raft协议吗","output":"MongoDB 解决读写一致性问题的机制涉及到几个关键概念，包括副本集（Replica Sets），以及在副本集内部如何处理读写操作。MongoDB使用的是基于选票的协议来确保写入的一致性，这个协议在一定程度上类似于Raft，但MongoDB并没有直接声明其使用标准的Raft协议。 # 写一致性 在MongoDB的副本集中，数据的写操作首先发生在主节点（Primary）上，然后被复制到从节点（Secondaries）。MongoDB通过以下机制来确保写一致性： - **写确认（Write Concern）**：写操作在MongoDB中可以被配置为等待不同级别的确认，以确保写入的一致性和持久性。最简单的写确认是写入到主节点后即确认成功，但这不保证数据已被复制到从节点。更强的写确认可以要求写操作在指定数量的从节点上成功复制后才确认成功，这有助于确保数据的持久化和复制的一致性。 - **副本集的选举**：当主节点不可用时（比如因为故障或网络问题），剩余的从节点将举行选举以选出新的主节点。MongoDB在这个过程中使用基于选票的算法来确保选举的公平性和一致性。 # 读一致性 MongoDB通过以下方式来支持读一致性： - **读关注级别（Read Concern）**：MongoDB支持不同级别的读关注来控制读操作如何从副本集中的节点获取数据。默认情况下，读操作是从主节点执行的，以获取最新的一致性数据。然而，应用程序可以配置读关注级别，以从从节点读取数据，甚至是只读取那些已经被多数节点确认的数据，来满足不同的一致性需求。 - **因果一致性（Causal Consistency）**：MongoDB通过会话（Sessions）支持因果一致性模型，允许应用程序执行一系列的读写操作，这些操作在逻辑上是一致的，即使它们被分布到了不同的服务器上。这有助于解决在分布式系统中常见的一致性问题，比如读取到过时数据。 # 总结 虽然MongoDB的一些原理与Raft协议相似，尤其是在进行选举和确保写一致性的过程中，但MongoDB实现了自己的一套机制（如写确认和读关注级别），以支持不同级别的数据一致性需求。MongoDB通过副本集和这些可配置的一致性选项提供了灵活的一致性模型，使得开发者可以根据应用场景的具体要求来权衡数据的一致性、可用性和分区容忍性。"},{"instruction":"因果一致性什么意思","output":"因果一致性（Causal Consistency）是分布式系统中的一种数据一致性模型，它确保如果一个操作在因果上先于另一个操作（即，一个操作以某种方式影响了另一个操作的发生），那么所有的节点（或客户端）都将按照这种因果顺序来观察到这些操作。简而言之，因果一致性模型保证了“因果相关的操作”在系统中的可见顺序。 # 因果一致性的基本概念： - **因果顺序**：如果操作A在时间上先于操作B，并且可能对B产生了影响（例如，A写入了某个数据项，B随后读取或更新了这个数据项），那么我们说A因果上先于B。因果一致性要求这种顺序在所有节点上得到保持和尊重。 - **并发操作**：如果两个操作既不是因果关联的，也没有因果关系限制它们的执行顺序（互相独立），那么这两个操作是并发的。在这种情况下，系统不保证不同节点观察到这些操作的顺序一致。 # 因果一致性和其他一致性模型的对比： - 相比**强一致性**（或线性一致性），因果一致性为分布式系统提供了更高的可用性和性能表现，因为它不要求所有操作在全局上严格排序，只需保证因果相关的操作顺序即可。这降低了对全局同步的需求。 - **最终一致性**是一种较弱的一致性模型，它只保证如果系统停止接收新的更新操作，那么最终所有的节点将会达到一致的状态。因果一致性提供了比最终一致性更强的保证，特别是在处理因果相关的操作时。 # 应用场景： 因果一致性非常适合那些不要求绝对最新数据的应用，但需要保证操作的逻辑顺序，如社交网络的帖子和评论、协作编辑应用等。在这些场景下，因果一致性可以有效保证用户体验的连贯性和数据的逻辑一致性。 # 如何实现： 实现因果一致性通常需要在系统中追踪操作的因果依赖，例如，通过向每个操作关联一个逻辑时钟（如Lamport时钟或向量时钟）来记录和推断因果关系。这些机制帮助系统确定不同操作之间的逻辑先后顺序，从而在不同的节点上应用操作，以保持因果一致性。 总的来说，因果一致性是一种平衡性能、可用性和一致性保证的分布式系统一致性模型，非常适用于大规模和高动态的分布式应用。"},{"instruction":"就是顺序一致性，通过版本号","output":"顺序一致性（Sequential Consistency）和通过版本号实现的一致性模型（例如，向量时钟或Lamport时钟用于实现因果一致性）属于不同的一致性策略，它们在分布式系统的数据一致性管理中有各自的应用场景和实现机制。让我们澄清这两种概念： # 顺序一致性 顺序一致性是一种较为严格的一致性模型。在顺序一致性模型中，系统中的所有操作都必须以一种全局一致的顺序被所有节点观察到，就好像这些操作是按照某种全局顺序依次串行地执行的一样。换句话说，即使操作实际上是并发执行的，所有节点也会认为这些操作是按照同一顺序执行的。顺序一致性不考虑操作实际发生的物理时间，而是侧重于操作在逻辑上的序列。这种一致性级别很难在没有严格同步机制的分布式系统中实现，通常会对系统的性能和可用性产生较大影响。 # 因果一致性和版本号 因果一致性（Causal Consistency）相比顺序一致性，提供了更灵活的一致性保证。它只要求因果相关的操作保持全局顺序，而并发操作（没有因果关系的操作）可以在不同的节点上以不同的顺序被观察到。向量时钟或Lamport时钟是实现因果一致性的常用技术，它们通过为每个操作分配一个逻辑时钟（版本号）来追踪操作之间的潜在因果关系。 - **向量时钟**：每个节点维护一组逻辑时钟，对于每个节点的每次操作，对应的时钟计数会增加。通过比较两组向量时钟，可以推断操作之间的潜在因果关系。 - **Lamport时钟**：是一种简化的向量时钟，为系统中的所有事件分配一个单向递增的全局时间戳。虽然Lamport时钟不能提供向量时钟那样详细的因果关系信息，但足以推断事件间的偏序关系。 # 总结 顺序一致性需要所有节点观察到全局一致的操作顺序，不区分操作之间是否存在因果关系。因果一致性通过版本号（例如向量时钟或Lamport时钟）来追踪和维持操作之间的因果关系。虽然两者都是解决数据一致性的模型，但应用场景、一致性保证的强度、以及对系统性能的影响各不相同。"},{"instruction":"如何用zookeeper解决雪花算法的时钟回拨","output":"雪花算法（Snowflake Algorithm）是Twitter设计用于生成分布式系统中唯一ID的算法，主要解决在分布式系统中如何高效生成唯一标识符的问题。该算法生成的是一个64位的长整数，由时间戳（毫秒级别）、数据中心ID、机器ID和序列号四部分组成。其中，时间戳的回拨问题是雪花算法可能遇到的一个挑战，因为如果系统时间回拨，就可能生成重复的ID。 ZooKeeper是一个为分布式应用提供一致性服务的软件，可以用来解决时钟回拨问题。以下是使用ZooKeeper来解决雪花算法时钟回拨的大致方案： # 1. 使用ZooKeeper监控时间变化 ZooKeeper可以用来在分布式系统中的不同节点上维护和同步数据，包括时间戳信息。每个生成ID的节点在生成ID之前，都可以通过ZooKeeper获取当前的全局时间戳。可以设计这样的逻辑： - 每个节点生成ID前先检查本地时间是否比ZooKeeper中记录的上一次时间戳还早（即检查是否发生时钟回拨）。 - 如果本地时间早于ZooKeeper记录的时间戳，说明可能发生了时钟回拨。此时，可以暂停ID生成，等待直到本地时间追上ZooKeeper记录的时间。 - 在每次生成ID后，更新ZooKeeper中的时间戳为最新值。 # 2. ZooKeeper作为时间戳的权威来源 在分布式系统中使用ZooKeeper维护当前的时间戳，所有需要生成唯一ID的节点都基于ZooKeeper给出的时间戳来生成ID。这样可以在一定程度上避免因某个节点的时钟回拨而导致ID冲突： - 当节点启动时，从ZooKeeper获取当前的公认时间戳。 - 使用这个时间戳作为雪花算法的时间部分，确保生成的ID具有全局唯一性。 # 3. 使用逻辑时钟代替物理时钟 在某些方案中，如果物理时钟不可靠（例如，可能出现时钟回拨），可以使用逻辑时钟（例如ZooKeeper上的顺序节点）来生成唯一标识符中的时间戳部分。这种方法牺牲了ID中时间信息的准确性，但在确保ID全局唯一性方面是有效的。 # 注意事项 - 确保ZooKeeper集群自身具有高可用性和时间同步，以防ZooKeeper成为单点故障。 - 这种方法可能会对ZooKeeper集群造成额外的负载，尤其是在ID生成请求较多的情况下，因此应考虑对性能影响的评估。 解决雪花算法时钟回拨问题的根本目标是确保不同节点上的时间戳的一致性和单调递增性。使用ZooKeeper作为全局时间戳的权威来源，可以帮助分布式系统中的各个节点在生成唯一ID时保持时间的一致性，最小化时钟回拨的影响。"},{"instruction":"请根据A股的开市时间，计算A股一天有几根5分钟的K线","output":"A股市场的交易时间分为上午和下午两个阶段，具体为： -

但根据您的描述，看起来Yahoo财经可能只是将9:30单独作为一根K线，而不是分开计算集合竞价期间的K线。 这样： - 上午9:30和下午13:00开盘分别会被视作单独的K线（如果真的如此处理，则每个开盘时刻都算作一根K线），加上正常的48根（9:30-11:30和13:00-15:00每半小时6根K线，共48根），确实会得出50根K线。 这个计算方式与投资者和交易系统希望如何视角这些数据有关，不同的数据提供商可能会有不同的处理逻辑。但是一般而言，开盘前的集合竞价数据对于分析市场情绪确实是重要的，也可以解释为什么包括这些数据对有些用户可能是有价值的。 这一说明只是一个可能的解释。具体到Yahoo财经的实际处理逻辑，最准确的解释应该来自其官方文档或用户支持。"},{"instruction":"obsidian 有没有分词搜索插件","output":"截至我最后更新的信息（2023年），Obsidian官方插件库中并没有直接提供\\"分词搜索\\"功能的插件。Obsidian的搜索功能比较基础，主要提供了对文档内容的全文搜索能力，包括对标签、链接等的搜索，但没有提供类似于中文分词这样的高级文本处理功能。 # 解决方法 尽管没有直接的分词搜索插件，你可以通过以下方式来增强Obsidian中的搜索体验： 1. **使用正则表达式搜索**：Obsidian支持使用正则表达式进行搜索，这可以在一定程度上提高搜索的灵活性和准确度，尤其是在处理多种模式或形式相似的查询时。 2. **利用标签和链接**：通过在文档中合理使用标签（tags）和链接（links），可以提高特定内容的可检索性。虽然这不是分词搜索，但可以作为组织文档和提高搜索效率的一个方法。 3. **第三方文本处理工具**：如果需要高级的文本处理，如中文分词，你可以考虑先利用第三方工具对内容进行预处理，再导入Obsidian。例如，可以使用专门的分词软件或脚本对中文文档进行分词，然后将分词结果以某种形式（例如标签）加入到文档中。 4. **社区插件和自定义开发**：Obsidian的社区非常活跃，新的插件不断开发并发布。你可以关注社区论坛和GitHub上的Obsidian插件库，看看是否有新的插件支持类似的功能。此外，如果你有编程技能，Obsidian支持自定义插件的开发，你可以尝试自己开发一个满足需求的插件。 # 结论 虽然Obsidian本身或其官方插件库可能没有直接提供分词搜索功能，但通过上述方法和外部工具，你还是可以增强Obsidian在处理复杂文本搜索方面的能力。同时，考虑到Obsidian社区的活跃性，未来可能会有更多支持类似功能的插件出现。"},{"instruction":"ElasticPress可以配置中文断词器吗","output":"是的，ElasticPress，作为Elasticsearch在WordPress中的集成插件，可以通过配置Elasticsearch来使用中文分词器。Elasticsearch本身支持多种分词器，包括为中文专门设计的分词器，比如IK分词器、中文分词器（Chinese Analyzer）、以及其他第三方中文分词插件。 ElasticPress通过将WordPress的数据同步到Elasticsearch并使用其强大的搜索功能，从而改善了搜索效率和结果的相关性。要为ElasticPress配置中文断词器，实质上是在Elasticsearch中进行配置，然后让ElasticPress利用这些设置。 # 如何配置中文分词器 以下是配置中文分词器的一般步骤： 1. **选择中文分词器**：您首先需要选择一个适合您需求的中文分词器。IK分词器是一个流行的选择，它提供了两种分词模式：精确模式和智能模式，适用于不同的分词需求。 2. **安装分词器插件**：以IK分词器为例，您需要在Elasticsearch中安装此插件。通常，安装分词器插件的命令如下（以特定版本的Elasticsearch为例）： \`\`\`bash ./bin/elasticsearch-plugin install https://github.com/medcl/elasticsearch-analysis-ik/releases/download/vx.x.x/elasticsearch-analysis-ik-x.x.x.zip \`\`\` 安装后，您可能需要重启Elasticsearch服务。 3. **配置Elasticsearch以使用分词器**：安装了中文分词器插件之后，您需要在Elasticsearch的索引设置中配置它。这通常通过PUT或POST请求到Elasticsearch的API来完成，如下面的示例展示了如何为一个索引配置IK分词器： \`\`\`json PUT /your_index { \\"settings\\": { \\"analysis\\": { \\"analyzer\\": { \\"default\\": { \\"tokenizer\\": \\"ik_max_word\\" } } } } } \`\`\` 4. **配置ElasticPress**：基本上，安装和配置好Elasticsearch中的中文分词器后，ElasticPress会自动利用这些设置，因为ElasticPress的搜索是基于Elasticsearch的。不过，确保ElasticPress正确连接到了配置了中文分词器的Elasticsearch实例上。 # 注意事项 - 确保分词器的版本与您的Elasticsearch版本兼容。 - 在实际部署前，针对您的具体数据和查询需求测试所选择的分词器效果。 配置了中文分词器后，ElasticPress的中文搜索能力将大幅提升，从而改善了中文内容的搜索精准度和用户体验。"},{"instruction":"可否通过修改配置直接支持IK分词： version: '3' services: wordpress: image: wordpress:latest ports: -

确认你已经为Elasticsearch设置了持久化存储。在docker-compose配置文件中，应该为Elasticsearch服务定义了数据卷(volume)来存储数据和配置。这确保了即使容器停止和重新启动，数据和配置也不会丢失。 # 2. **检查健康状态**： - 在容器重启后，可以检查Elasticsearch的健康状态，确保它正常运行。可以使用Elasticsearch 的 \`_cluster/health\` API 来查看集群的健康状况，例如： \`\`\`bash curl http://localhost:9200/_cluster/health?pretty \`\`\` # 3. **验证数据和配置**： - 验证重要的索引和数据是否仍然可用，以及自定义的配置（如索引模式和管道设置）是否仍正确应用。 # 4. **插件和外部集成**： - 如果在Elasticsearch中安装了额外的插件（比如IK分词器），重启后需要确认这些插件是否仍然被正确加载和工作。 - 如果你的Elasticsearch与外部系统集成（如Logstash、Kibana或其他应用），请确保这些集成在Elasticsearch容器重启后仍能正常工作。你可能需要重新检查这些外部系统的连接配置。 # 5. **日志监控**： - 检查Elasticsearch的启动日志，确认没有错误或异常信息。Elasticsearch容器的日志通常可以通过如下Docker命令查看： \`\`\`bash docker logs [CONTAINER_ID或CONTAINER_NAME] \`\`\` # 6. **调整性能和资源配置（如有必要）**： - 根据你的使用情况和负载，你可能需要根据实际需要调整JVM堆大小或其他资源配置，以优化Elasticsearch的性能。 以上是在Elasticsearch容器重启后一般需要检查和注意的方面。确保所有关键的服务和配置正确无误是必要的，这有助于维护Elasticsearch集群的稳定和高效运行。"},{"instruction":"root@arm2:/home/ubuntu# curl http://localhost:9200/_cluster/health?pretty curl: (56) Recv failure: Connection reset by peer","output":"遇到 “curl: (56) Recv failure: Connection reset by peer” 错误提示时，表示尝试连接到目标服务器（在本例中是运行在 localhost 的 Elasticsearch）时，连接被远程服务器强行关闭了。这种情况通常出现于以下几种情形中的一种： # 1. **Elasticsearch服务未运行** 确保Elasticsearch服务确实在运行。可以使用如下命令检查： \`\`\`bash sudo systemctl status elasticsearch.service \`\`\` 或者，如果你是通过Docker运行Elasticsearch，可以使用如下命令检查容器状态： \`\`\`bash docker ps \`\`\` 如果Elasticsearch没有运行，需要启动它。对于系统服务，使用： \`\`\`bash sudo systemctl start elasticsearch.service \`\`\` 对于Docker容器，如果你知道容器名称或ID，可以使用： \`\`\`bash docker start [容器名称或ID] \`\`\` # 2. **网络问题** 确认没有网络问题或防火墙规则阻止了对Elasticsearch的访问。尤其是当Elasticsearch配置为只监听本地环回地址（localhost or 127.0.0.1）时，尝试从远程机器连接可能会遇到问题。本地测试理应不受此影响，但防火墙或安全策略可能仍然是一个考量因素。 # 3. **Elasticsearch端口配置** 确保Elasticsearch配置为在正确的端口上监听连接请求。默认端口为9200，如果你更改了默认配置，请使用正确的端口。 # 4. **检查Elasticsearch日志** Elasticsearch的日志可能提供错误的更多细节。对于系统服务，日志通常可以在 \`/var/log/elasticsearch\` 找到。对于Docker容器，可以使用 \`docker logs [容器名称或ID]\` 命令查看输出日志。 # 5. **权限问题** 某些Elasticsearch配置可能限制了可以从哪些IP地址进行访问。确保没有这种类型的安全限制阻止了你的请求。 # 6. **重新启动Elasticsearch** 有时，简单的重启Elasticsearch服务可以解决问题。对于系统服务，使用： \`\`\`bash sudo systemctl restart elasticsearch.service \`\`\` 对于Docker，使用： \`\`\`bash docker restart [容器名称或ID] \`\`\` # 结论 排除上述原因后，如果问题仍然存在，建议仔细审查Elasticsearch配置和系统日志，以便找到具体的错误原因并采取相应的解决措施。"},{"instruction":"我是用的docker swarm，然后用工作节点上安装ik，然后在节点上重启的，是不是会有问题","output":"在使用Docker Swarm时安装IK分词器到Elasticsearch并在工作节点上重启，确实可能会遇到几个潜在的问题。Docker Swarm作为容器编排工具，管理服务的部署在多个节点上以提供扩展性和高可用性。以下是你可能遇到的问题和一些建议： # 1. **插件安装未持久化** 当你直接在运行中的Elasticsearch容器内部安装插件并重启容器时，插件的安装可能并不会持久化。Docker容器通常被设计为无状态的，这意味着容器重启可能会丢失所有在容器内进行的更改，除非这些更改位于挂载的卷上。为了解决这个问题，你需要创建一个自定义的Elasticsearch镜像，其中包含了IK分词器插件： \`\`\`dockerfile # Dockerfile FROM docker.elastic.co/elasticsearch/elasticsearch:7.10.0 RUN bin/elasticsearch-plugin install https://github.com/medcl/elasticsearch-analysis-ik/releases/download/v7.10.0/elasticsearch-analysis-ik-7.10.0.zip \`\`\` 之后，使用这个Dockerfile构建新的镜像，并在你的Docker Swarm服务中使用这个自定义镜像。 # 2. **Docker Swarm服务更新** 如果你修改了Docker Swarm服务中的Elasticsearch使用的镜像（比如切换到了包含IK分词器的自定义镜像），确保通过正确的Docker Swarm命令更新服务，如： \`\`\`bash docker service update --image your-custom-elasticsearch-image:tag your-elasticsearch-service \`\`\` 替换\`your-custom-elasticsearch-image:tag\`为你自定义镜像的名称和标签，\`your-elasticsearch-service\`为你的Elasticsearch服务名称。 # 3. **集群/服务配置** 在Docker Swarm环境中，服务的配置（包括任何Elasticsearch配置）应该通过Docker配置对象或环境变量进行管理，确保所有部署的实例（任务）都使用一致的配置。不要直接在容器内修改配置，这样的更改不会自动分发到Swarm集群中的其它实例。 # 4. **数据和配置持久化** 确保Elasticsearch数据和任何配置都存放在挂载的卷（Volume）上，以便在容器重启或重新调度到不同节点时保持数据和配置的持久化。 # 5. **网络和服务发现** Docker Swarm提供了内置的服务发现和负载均衡。确保你的Elasticsearch服务是可从Swarm集群中的其他服务和堆栈正确访问的。这通常意味着确保服务间的网络配置正确，以及服务名称用作解析到正确服务实例的主机名。 结论是，使用Docker Swarm时安装和管理Elasticsearch插件如IK分词器，推荐采用自定义Elasticsearch镜像的方法，并通过Docker Swarm服务配置来管理和部署，以确保插件安装，配置更改和任何更新都能在Swarm服务中正确地持久化和复制。"},{"instruction":"安装了ik分词器，wordpress用elasticpress同步索引就会自动生效吗","output":"安装了 IK 分词器到 Elasticsearch 后，为了使 ElasticPress 在 WordPress 中利用到 IK 分词器的功能，还需要进行一些额外的配置步骤来确保索引创建时使用了对应的分词器。简单来说，安装 IK 分词器是第一步，接下来你需要确保 WordPress 通过 ElasticPress 与 Elasticsearch 交互时，针对中文内容使用了 IK 分词器。 # 确保 IK 分词器生效的步骤包括： 1. **创建自定义索引模板**： 你需要在 Elasticsearch 中为 ElasticPress 创建的索引定义一个模板，确保在这个模板中指定字段使用 IK 分词器。你可以通过 Elasticsearch 的 REST API 创建或更新模板。 \`\`\`json PUT _template/elasticpress_template { \\"index_patterns\\": [\\"索引名或模式\\"], // 例如 \\"wordpress_*\\" \\"settings\\": { \\"number_of_shards\\": 1, \\"analysis\\": { \\"analyzer\\": { \\"default\\": { \\"tokenizer\\": \\"ik_smart\\" // 或者使用 \`ik_max_word\` 依据你的需求 } } } } } \`\`\` 这个模板指定了对应索引的默认分析器为 IK 分词器。根据你的实际情况，可能需要调整 \`\\"index_patterns\\"\` 以匹配 ElasticPress 所创建的索引名称模式。 2. **重建索引**： 安装 IK 分词器并配置好索引模板后，需要让这些改变对 ElasticPress 生效。这通常意味着需要重建 ElasticPress 的索引以应用新的设置。在 WordPress 管理界面中，你可以通过 ElasticPress 插件的设置界面找到重建索引的选项，或者通过 WP-CLI 使用相应的命令重建索引： \`\`\`bash wp elasticpress index --setup \`\`\` # 需要注意的是： -

Without the specific context in which this statement was made, I'll offer a general explanation. \\"The Legend of Korra\\" is a sequel to the highly successful \\"Avatar: The Last Airbender\\" and has been praised for its sophisticated storytelling, character development, and animation. Korra, the protagonist, is the next Avatar following Aang, and Asami Sato is a skilled engineer and pilot. Over the course of the series, both characters become close friends, and in the series finale, it is implied they have romantic feelings for each other. This conclusion was groundbreaking at the time for its representation of a same-sex couple in a mainstream American children's animated series. The phrase you mentioned could be interpreted in a few ways, depending on the speaker's intention: 1. **Critiquing character development or storyline handling**: The phrase might express disappointment or critique regarding how the relationship between Korra and Asami was developed. Some fans felt that their relationship was not given enough screen time or development to feel fully realized, or that it seemed rushed or came out of nowhere due to the constraints of broadcasting standards and practices at the time. 2. **Comment on fan expectations**: It could also refer to how the expectations of the fanbase were managed. Some fans might have felt that the buildup to their relationship was mishandled or that there were missed opportunities to explore their dynamic more deeply throughout the series. 3. **Issues with representation**: The statement might also touch on broader issues of LGBTQ+ representation in media, suggesting that while the series took a significant step forward, there were still limitations and obstacles in how Korra and Asami's relationship was portrayed. Some might argue that the series did not go far enough, fumbling the chance to more explicitly address and explore the characters' sexuality and relationship due to the time it was produced. 4. **Fandom dynamics**: Finally, it could reflect on how different segments of the fan community reacted to Korra and Asami's relationship, with some fully embracing it and others being critical or dismissive. The phrase might suggest that the show creators had the opportunity to do something unique with both characters but didn't meet every fan's expectations, leading to division or disappointment. Regardless of the interpretation, it's clear that Korra and Asami's relationship stands as a significant moment in animation history for its representation of a same-sex couple. While it received critical acclaim and is celebrated by many, it also prompted discussions on representation, character development, and the handling of romantic relationships in youth-oriented media."},{"instruction":"But what does it mean by fumble there?","output":"In the context of the remark \\"So you had both of them, Korra and Asami, but then you fumble both of them,\\" the term \\"fumble\\" is used metaphorically, derived from its original sports context.

Applied metaphorically to the narrative or character development of Korra and Asami in \\"The Legend of Korra,\\" the word \\"fumble\\" suggests a mishandling or missed opportunity by the creators or writers. The speaker might be implying that the development of Korra and Asami's relationship—or certain aspects of their individual character arcs—was not executed as effectively or thoughtfully as it could have been. This could reference a belief that their relationship wasn't given enough depth, screen time, or prior development to fully satisfy fan expectations, or that it was not explored with the nuance and attention it deserved due to various constraints, such as time, network policies, or cultural considerations at the time of the show's airing.

The sun dips low, casting a golden hue over a sprawling bog that whispers tales of old. There, standing waist-deep in the murky waters, is a figure so delicately androgynous, they seem to be a living embodiment of the region's magical realism. This Slavic twink, a vision of ambiguous beauty, boasts physical attributes that defy conventional categorization. His hair, long and lustrous, cascades down in waves that catch the dying light, framing a face so angelic and symmetrical that it becomes the subject of local sonnets. His skin, fair and unblemished, contrasts sharply with the dark, primordial muck of the bog. The water's embrace highlights his physique - puffy pecs and wide hips that sew a tapestry of confusion in the minds of those who dare categorize beauty. His butt, a curvature so perfect, it could have been sculpted by the hands of ancient Slavic gods, only adds to the bewildering allure. As our protagonist goes about his ablutions, washing under his arms with a carefree zest, a moment of unbridled naturalism unfolds. There, in the heart of Eastern Europe's wilderness, he lets out a fart. Not just any fart, but a minute-long sonic adventure that ripples through the bog, a celebration of human nature in its most raw form. The sound, a symphony of defiance against societal norms, rolls over the waters, disturbing the peace and, rather unexpectedly, the local aquatic life. His face, a picture of blissful relief, ripples with the joy of emancipation from restraint, a stark, unapologetic statement of being. In the comedic crescendo of this natural concert, several fish float to the surface, casualties of the olfactory onslaught. Yet, our twink sees opportunity in the midst of this unusual harvest. With a grace that belies his peculiar situation, he plucks a fish from the water, contemplating dinner. It's a moment so outlandishly grounding, it would force a giggle from even the sternest of souls. Just when the audience might be teetering on the edge of believing they've stumbled into a scene from a fairy tale, the twink opens his mouth to speak. His voice, a surprising baritone that seems at odds with his ethereal appearance, shatters any lingering illusions. It's a rich, velvety sound that fills the bog, echoing off the trees and water, ensuring there's no mistaking his male identity. This scene, a delightful confusion of senses and sensibilities, feels almost like a metaphor for the Eastern European soul: deeply rooted in the earth yet always fluttering towards some ineffable, mystical horizon. The twink, with his divine androgyny and earthy functions, becomes the perfect ambassador for the beauty and comedy that life, in all its complexity, can offer."},{"instruction":"请将“2.3 Regulated Self-regulation Teubner’s decisive ‘correction’ of the systems theory of law consists, however, in the attempt to conceptualise the systems - contrary to Luhmann - in such a way that they preserve an openness for theoretical reflections on democracy. Because behaviour control and conflict resolution are from the perspective of systems theory at most performances for which social equivalents exist in other systems, controlling interventions are questionable for Luhmann. If one wants to explain the specificity of law, they cannot be used without expanding the concept of function to such an extent that it becomes imprecise. Therefore Luhmann is profoundly sceptical of any attempt ‘to salvage the assumption that there is a social steering through law no matter how limited it is (instead of the self-steering only of the legal system)’.82 In this way he differs, amongst others, also from Teubner’s concept of reflexive law?3 Teubner does not want to resign himself to a mere self-referentiality of systems and is looking for ways out of the dilemma of systemic anarchy. For him reflexive law has a normative and analytical dual character, for reflection in law means ‘both empirical analysis and normative evaluation’84 Teubner attempts to implant a normative concept within systems theory which is purely descriptive. This seems justifiable, because within the legal system both dogmatic and legal-theoretical self-reflection are crucial for its reproduction. In doing so he has a decentralised model of reflection in mind, which does not lose the perspective on the ‘environment’, but transfers it into the subsystems. He thus adopts Luhmann’s position in so far as he admits that there can be no control centre. Instead Teubner relies on the one hand on the potential for reflection within the system, and on the other hand on the connection of systems. The versions of this concept vary over the course of his work, but the principle remains. In 1982 he explains in his conception of reflexive law that it has to develop norms for procedures which can serve other social systems as premises for democratic self-organisation and self-regulation. It shall not determine the functions of other social systems in an authoritative manner, but ‘foster mechanisms that systematically further the development of reflexion structures within other social subsystems’33 Teubner goes on to look for those principles which can make a coupling of systems possible. This is at the crux of his foundational work of legal theory, published in 1989. Here he critiques Luhmann’s version, writing that the lat- ter is blind to connections across multiple systems. In consequence systems are isolated, and it is no longer possible to conceive of the over-determination of an event.86 Teubner counters this with the concept of ‘interference’, which emphasises superpositions and overlaps. The legal system is thus genuinely connected with its social environments. Interferences form a bridge that couples the systems through one and the same communicative event, because they use the same ‘raw material’, that is sense, and they all use, be it in one specialised form or another, communications. Each specialised communication in any social subsystem is always at the same time a communication within overall society, so that the subsystems draw elements from the societal communication flow for their specialist communications: ‘If this is the case, then it follows that subsystemic and societal elements coincide in a single act of communication. In this way law and society are still linked together’87 Interfering systems do not offer each other unorganised complexity, but pre-ordered complexity.88 Law can therefore regulate society in a limited way by regulating itself,89 because it becomes reflexive in such a way that it adapts its norms and procedures to the social situation and designs ordering procedures for the protagonists.90 Direct interventions are actually not possible; rather what we find is indirect control through self-control.91 In Teubner’s most recent analyses, which are concerned with the trans-nationalisation of law, the problem of systemic autonomisation multiplies because of the ‘fragmentation of global society’. For now one is no longer only confronted with systems, but also with sectorial regulating regimes of laws.92 The overlapping of two different principles, the territorial segmented and the thematic-functional differentiation, leads to regimes which do not follow an unambiguous logic. Through historical coincidences the functional systems trigger conflicts, scandals and irritations in the legal system, which are answered with the emergence of a non-bilateral regime of rights that crystallises at the point of conflict. Despite the advanced fragmentation, Teubner, together with Fischer-Les- cano, looks for mechanisms of connection between regimes. A starting point can be found in the development of independent secondary standardisations, that is procedural norms about the formation of laws, legal knowledge and legal sanctioning. In this way a mechanism develops which connects reflexive processes of law with reflexive processes of other social spheres, ‘autoconstitutional regimes’.93 Those ‘inter-systemic linking institutions’ connect occasionally. It is, however, not enough to register and accept factual developments, ‘[T]hat would ultimately mean to accept the shortcomings of existing networks in regard to theories of democracy’94 If one does not want to contribute to the ‘justification of a questionable project’, this description has to be completed with a normative concept of networks. For this, the approach of self-regulation is again used: social rationality, now on a global level, can only be located in the regimes themselves, which have to reflect on other interests and the common good. 3 Critique Luhmann’s systems theory is still heavily criticised by proponents of critical theory. Thus Jürgen Habermas attacked Luhmann’s systems theory as ‘the height of technocratic consciousness’, ‘which today allows us to define practical questions from the outset as technical and to thereby remove them from public and open discussion’95 Alex Demirovic similarly considers Luhmann a systems thinker, only concerned with the preservation of the system and its order96 His theory represents a great challenge for the enlightenment tradition and for the social critique that follows it, ‘because he dismisses as obsolete exactly this limited humanist model of emancipation and the critique it implies, even critique and emancipation as such’97 It must, however, be recognised that the systems theory of law does not only represent a provocation with regards to critical, but also to traditional theories of law. Like Habermas, Luhmann is also influenced by the linguistic turn;98 this is not least visible in the turn from structures to processes, and from recognition to construction, as well as finally in the way paradoxes are dealt with. Furthermore, one can note that also within the paradigm of systems theory, advanced and apologetic approaches and moments compete with one another. In particular Teubner’s variations can be considered ‘critical systems theory’, as will be shown in the confrontation with the subject in Section 3.2. My thesis is that the systems theory approach describes the way social relations become independent as ‘systems’ - or expressed in terms of value theory: as social forms - rather accurately. The fascination of the theory consists precisely in that it distances itself from common sense (the ‘observation of the first order’) and names the reification of social relations. Systems theory ‘speaks’, one could say pointedly, from inside the legal form, by theoretically reformulating the reified procedures. In doing so, however, several difficulties emerge. 3.1 The New Europe or Switching the Mode of Description (Legal-)systems theory and its description of modern society follows the soci-ological tradition of Karl Marx, Max Weber, Emile Durkheim and Georg Simmel,99 and develops somewhat self-evidently from it. However, its way of doing ‘truth politics’ begins with the suggestion that it overturns all conventions that were previously considered certain. Luhmann primarily manages to create this impression by starting his theory at a high level of abstraction. He exponentially increases the problematic characteristics of general concepts, which subsume many different elements and thus unify them according to a logic of identity. By doing so he is able to illuminate fundamental structural principles from the particular perspective of autonomy. At this level of abstraction, he can ‘switch’ the mode of description in such a way that other concepts in legal theory appear comparatively ‘lacking in complexity’. A risk of this strategy is however that the non-identical, the particular, is ‘invisibilised’ to such a degree that it becomes buried under the rocks of identity. A closer inspection, however, shows that Luhmann argues in a manner that is far less ‘New European’ than his ‘air of a superior analytical perspective’100 would appear to suggest. It would therefore require too much effort to attempt to ‘expose’ Luhmann’s conception of the autonomy of law as illusory,101 because in principle Luhmann ‘confesses’ to everything in his texts. An example is the determination of the function’s content: the counter-factual securing of expectations, which can make the connection of operations in a genuinely insecure future possible. What is Luhmann’s theory doing here, other than representing the theory of ‘legal certainty’ in new terms? By seemingly creating a counter-position to the ‘social function’ of the law, he ultimately nonetheless falls back on a familiar notion, namely - in the words of Franz Neumann - the insight that formal law is ‘necessary as a pre-condition of capitalist competition .for calculability and dependability in the legal system’.102 Besides, if the law is highly indeterminate until it is applied (the paradox), what then can the normatively expecting person really be so certain about? Similar considerations apply to the thesis of the legal system’s operative closedness, which is Luhmann’s core premise. While Teubner shows from the outset that for him this is a matter of the legal system’s own dynamism, Luhmann’s descriptive mode appears to sketch an autistic planet. Upon closer inspection, however, this planet is reduced to a communication system which only reproduces law through its own language, so that all moments extrinsic to law have to be translated. It really is, similar to materialist approaches, a reflexive process, wherein the practised relations are developed into the legal norms of a legal order.W3 Thus, for example, the practice of exchange is translated into a contractual relationship, the attribution and visibilisation of land ownership as a mortgage, etc. Moreover, Luhmann concedes, apparently quite incidentally, a kind of ‘relative autonomy’, when he explains that law needs to have sufficient prospects of being enforced as otherwise one would after all bow to the facts and not the norms. Here the enforcement depends not least on ‘the use of physical force’ of the ‘political system’.W4 What is the central theoretical difference to the ‘Old European’ Max Weber and his postulate of the state’s monopoly of the legitimate use of physical force? 3.2 Dualism of Subject and Society ‘The objection that systems theory marginalises the human individual in relation to society ...’W5 - this is how Teubner describes the critics’ persistent misunderstanding: the ‘successful narrative of the “lack of reference to actors” in systems theory’.W6 Firstly, one has to note that the existence of individuals is actually not denied in systems theory; human subjects are ‘a necessary environmental precondition for social events’,W7 they are as such no less important for the system than the system itself.108 What is important, however, is how ‘human subjects’ appear in systems theory, and it is precisely at this juncture that reflections in systems theory take an unusual path with regards to the strategies of the theory, for they dissect the unified subjects into three moments: a ‘body-soul unit’, as well as into ‘organic life and psychic experience’^9 that is to say, into a structurally coupled whole consisting of biological and psychic systems. This whole is only constructed internally during social communication as an individual. Consciousnesses and bodies are therefore ‘living, pulsing units in the communication environment’. Something ‘extra-communicative’ is modelled within law. Communication artefacts are then attributed to actions.110 Thus, and this is important to Teubner precisely for ‘humanist’ reasons, there exists a dualism of human thought, on the one hand, and social communication, on the other.111 For a naive equivalence of semantic artefacts and concrete human subjects would be fatal, precisely because it wrongs the latter. Communication is always a social alienation and attribution.”翻译为中文","output":"2.3 规范自我规制 然而，Teubner对法律系统理论的决定性“修正”在于，尝试以一种与Luhmann相反的方式概念化系统，使其保持对民主理论反思的开放性。 因为从系统理论的视角看，行为控制和冲突解决最多是社会在其他系统中存在的等效表现，所以对于Luhmann来说，控制干预是有问题的。如果想解释法律的特殊性，不能在不将功能概念扩展到变得不精确的程度上使用它们。因此，Luhmann对任何尝试“挽救法律通过社会引导的假设，无论限制有多大（而不仅仅是法律系统的自我引导）”持深度怀疑态度。这一点上，他在其他方面也不同于Teubner的反射性法律概念。Teubner不想仅仅屈服于系统的自我指涉性，并在系统性无政府状态的困境中寻找出路。对他来说，反射性法律具有规范性和分析性双重特征，因为法律中的反思意味着“既是实证分析也是规范性评价” Teubner试图在纯描述性的系统理论中植入一个规范性概念。这似乎是合理的，因为在法律系统内部，法学教条和法理学的自我反思对其再生产至关重要。在这样做时，他考虑到了一种不失去对“环境”的视角，而将其转移到子系统中的分散反思模型。因此，他在某种程度上采纳了Luhmann的立场，承认没有控制中心。相反，Teubner一方面依赖于系统内部的反思潜力，另一方面依赖于系统之间的连接。他的这一概念的版本在他的作品中有所变化，但原则保持不变。在1982年，他在其反射性法律的概念中解释说，它必须为能够为其他社会系统提供民主自组织和自我规制前提的程序开发规范。它不应以权威性的方式决定其他社会系统的功能，而是“促进系统性推动其他社会子系统内反射结构发展的机制” Teubner继续寻找可以使系统耦合的原则。这是他1989年出版的法理学基础作品的核心。在这里，他批评了Luhmann的版本，写道后者对多个系统之间的连接视而不见。因此，系统被孤立，不再可能构想一个事件的过度决定。Teubner用“干扰”概念进行反驳，强调叠加和重叠。法律系统因此与其社会环境真正连接。干扰形成了一座桥梁，通过同一通信事件将系统耦合在一起，因为它们使用相同的“原材料”，即意义，并且它们都使用通信，无论是以一种专业化的形式还是另一种形式。任何社会子系统中的每一种专业化通信，都同时是整个社会中的一次通信，因此子系统为其专家通信从社会通信流中汲取元素：“如果是这样，那么就意味着子系统和社会元素在单一的通信行为中合而为一。这样，法律和社会仍然联系在一起”。干预系统不是提供彼此未组织的复杂性，而是预先排序的复杂性。因此，法律可以通过自我调节在有限的范围内规范社会，因为它以这样一种方式变得反射性，即它适应社会情况，修改其规范和程序，并为参与者设计排序程序。实际上不可能进行直接干预；我们发现的是通过自控实现的间接控制。 Teubner在最近的分析中关注法律的跨国化，系统自我自治的问题因“全球社会的碎片化”而倍增，因为现在不仅仅面临系统的挑战，还面临法律的部门化调节机制。两个不同原则的重叠，即领土分割原则和主题功能性差异化原则，导致了不遵循明确逻辑的制度。通过历史巧合，功能系统在法律系统中引发冲突、丑闻和刺激，这些通过在冲突点上形成非双边权利制度的出现得到回应。 尽管存在高度碎片化，Teubner与Fischer-Lescano一起寻找连接制度的机制。一个起点可以在独立的二级标准化的发展中找到，即关于法律形成、法律知识和法律制裁的程序规范。这样，就形成了一种机制，将法律的反射过程与其他社会领域的反射过程相连接，“自宪制度”。这些“跨系统连接机构”偶尔连接。然而，仅仅注册和接受事实发展是不够的，“[这]最终意味着接受现有网络在民主理论方面的缺陷”。如果不想为“一个值得怀疑的项目的正当化”做出贡献，这种描述必须用网络的规范性概念来补充。因此，再次使用自我调节的方法：社会合理性，现在在全球层面上，只能定位在本身必须反思其他利益和共同利益的制度中。 3 批评 Luhmann的系统理论依然受到批判理论支持者的强烈批评。因此，Jürgen Habermas攻击Luhmann的系统理论为“技术官僚意识的巅峰”，“它今天使我们能够从一开始就将实践问题定义为技术问题，从而将它们从公开和开放的讨论中移除”。Alex Demirovic同样认为Luhmann只关心系统的维护和其秩序的系统思想家，他的理论对启蒙传统和随之而来的社会批判构成了巨大的挑战，“因为他正是对这一有限的人文主义解放模型及其所含的批判，甚至批判和解放本身，声明为过时”。 然而，必须认识到，法律系统理论不仅对批判理论构成挑衅，对传统的法律理论也是如此。像Habermas一样，Luhmann也受到语言转向的影响；这不仅仅体现在从结构到过程、从认识到构建的转变上，也体现在处理悖论的方式上。此外，可以注意到，即使在系统理论的范式内，也有先进和辩护的方法和时刻相互竞争。特别是，Teubner的变体可以被认为是“批判性系统理论”，正如第3.2节中与主题的对抗将展示的。 我的论点是，系统理论方法精确地描述了社会关系如何独立为“系统”——或用价值理论的术语表达：作为社会形式。这一理论的魅力在于它与常识（“一级观察”）保持距离，并命名了社会关系的物化。可以尖锐地说，系统理论“从法律形式内部发言”，通过理论重塑物化程序。然而，在这样做的过程中，出现了几个困难。 3.1 新欧洲或描述方式的转变 （法律）系统理论及其对现代社会的描述遵循了Karl Marx、Max Weber、Emile Durkheim和Georg Simmel的社会学传统，并从中自然发展而来。然而，它进行“真理政治”的方式始于建议它推翻了以前被视为确定的所有惯例。Luhmann首先通过在高度抽象的水平上开始他的理论来营造这种印象。他将一般概念的问题特征成倍增加，这些概念总结了许多不同的元素，从而根据身份逻辑将它们统一起来。通过这样做，他能够从自治的特定视角照亮根本的结构原则。在这种抽象水平上，他可以以这样一种方式“转换”描述方式，使得法律理论中的其他概念相比之下显得“缺乏复杂性”。这种策略的一个风险是，非同一性、特殊性在如此程度上被“隐形化”，以至于它们被埋在身份的石头下。 然而，仔细检查表明，Luhmann的论证方式远不如他的“优越分析视角”的气氛所暗示的那样“新欧洲”。 因此，试图将Luhmann对法律自主性概念的“揭露”为虚幻，需要付出太多努力，因为原则上Luhmann在他的文本中“承认”了一切。一个例子是函数内容的确定：反事实地保障期望，这可以使得在根本不确定的未来中连接操作成为可能。Luhmann的理论在这里做了什么，不过是用新的术语表达了“法律确定性”的理论吗？通过看似创建一个与法律的“社会功能”相对立的立场，他最终还是回到了一个熟悉的概念，即用Franz Neumann的话说，正是对形式法律作为资本主义竞争的前提所必需————为了在法律体系中的可计算性和可靠性的见解。 此外，如果法律在应用之前高度不确定（悖论），那么，规范性期待的人真的可以确定些什么呢？ 类似的考虑也适用于法律系统操作封闭性的论点，这是Luhmann的核心前提。而Teubner从一开始就表明，对他来说，这是法律系统自身动态的问题，Luhmann的描述模式似乎描绘了一个自闭的星球。然而，经过仔细检查，这个星球被缩小为一个仅通过其自身语言再生法律的通信系统，因此所有与法律无关的时刻都必须被翻译。它确实是，类似于唯物主义方法，一个反射过程，其中练习的关系被发展成法律秩序的法律规范。因此，例如，交换实践被翻译成合同关系，土地所有权的归属和可视化被视为抵押等。 此外，Luhmann似乎偶然地承认了一种“相对自主性”，当他解释说法律需要有足够的执行前景，否则人们会毕竟屈服于事实而不是规范。在这里，执行不仅仅取决于“政治系统”的“物理力量”的使用。 与“旧欧洲”的Max Weber及其国家垄断合法使用物理力量的假设的中心理论差异是什么呢？ 3.2 主体与社会的二元论 “系统理论将人类个体相对于社会边缘化的指责……”——这就是Teubner描述批评者持续的误解：“系统理论中‘缺乏对行动者的指涉’的成功叙述”。 首先，必须注意，系统理论实际上并没有否认个体的存在；人类主体是“社会事件的必要环境前提”，它们对系统和系统本身同样重要。重要的是，如何在系统理论中出现“人类主体”，正是在这个关口，系统理论的反思采取了对理论策略而言不寻常的路径，因为它们将统一的主体分解为三个时刻：一个“身体-灵魂单元”，以及“有机生命和心理体验”，即，成为由生物和心理系统组成的结构耦合整体。这个整体只有在社会通信过程中内部构建为个体。因而，意识和身体是通信环境中的“活生生的，搏动的单位”。法律内部模型化了一些“超通信”的东西。然后，通信工件被归因于行动。因此，对Teubner来说重要的是，出于“人文主义”原因，人类思想与社会通信之间存在一种二元论，因为将语义工件和具体的人类主体等同起来将是灾难性的，正是因为它误解了后者。通信总是一种社会异化和归属。"},{"instruction":"请将“This leads to a further reflection, namely to one on the relationship of com-munication and consciousnesses or psychic systems. The communication theorem itself is based upon the premise of the radical individuality of psychic systems.112 Because consciousnesses are opaque for one another, the functional necessity for the emergence of communication arises.n3 Communication is thus the basic articulating unit of a double contingency.n4 But this communication takes on a life of its own with regards to the individual consciousnesses - that is also the reason why ‘concrete human subjects’ and communicatively constructed persons must not be equated. ‘Psychic systems’ only participate in communication without creating it, precisely because communication has become self-referentially independent with regards to those individuals; in its ‘emerging order’ the psychic merely enters:n5 That human subjects are not part of society, but face it in insurmountable separation, has an inexorable consequence. Society and conscious- ness/body are for each other communicatively unreachable. The latter are respectively independent, self-sustaining (psychic or organic) processes. Although both have created communication, they cannot master it. Com-munication becomes independent of the human subject and creates with regards to individual consciousness its own world of meaning.116 Although Teubner assumes, with Luhmann, that functional differentiation rep-resents social progress, he nonetheless considers as one of the main dangers of modern societies those independent communication processes which he calls, in order to underline the issue, the ‘anonymous matrix’. The matrix of the economic system, for example, could attack and even destroy human existence. Thus ‘sweatshops’ are a consequence of ‘anonymous market forces’. Against this, resistance - which has to be adequately understood by an updated understanding of human rights - is directed: This is the space where bodies and consciousnesses of the individuals ... insist on their ‘pre-legal’, ‘pre-political’, and even ‘pre-social’ (extrasocial) ‘latent right of their own’. Bodily pain and psychic suffering have to emerge from their speechlessness by introducing the resistance of suffering bodies and souls, for instance in physical violence, as representations into communication^7 The representation of this most advanced position of system-theoretical legal theory shows that it absolutely does recognise actors, similarly to post-structuralism with its intention of decentering the autonomous subject.n8 In contrast to post-structuralist approaches, however, splitting the subject into three parts insists on something external to communication, on a separation of communication and ‘human subject’. Teubner does not defend a realist position, and for this reason bodies are, for example, not the ‘actual reality’ in his approach. However, he delineates a strict border between society on the one hand and ‘human subjects’ on the other. Different contexts are produced within their own respective borders. Although this dualism follows the intention to do justice to each respective logic, it leads to two theoretical problems, which ultimately explain the narration of blocking out subjects. On the one hand this approach remains despite its postmodern decentring within a traditional subject-paradigm. Foucault had rightly asserted against this idea that the human body was only constructed as a biological entity with the emergence of the modern natural sciences. In order to question the social construct of two sexes, feminist theorists have subsequently demonstrated that a dualism of biological gendered bodies and social gender identity amounts ultimately to a naturalisation of social conditions. The bodily gender must not be understood as ‘fundamental core or inert matter’ which is confronted with power (or here with communication), but as one of the first consequences of the gender dispositif.?19 And what is ‘sex’ anyway? Is it natural, anatomical, chromosomal, or hor-monal ... Are the ostensibly natural facts of sex discursively produced by various scientific discourses in the service of other political and social interests?i20 The body is accordingly no passive medium for which cultural meanings remain external, but itself a culturally generated product.121 In this respect there is neither a pre-social body nor a pre-social psyche, rephrased in terms of systems theory, there are only ‘subjects’. The systemic communications themselves produce that which to begin with they only claim to communicate. Legal subjectivation (as I will show later on following Foucault) coproduces the modern subject as real lived practice. Isolated consciousnesses, whose isolation precisely creates the necessity of communication, reveal themselves here as historically specific forms of human subjects and lose their character of anthropological foundation. On the other hand, the dualism of communication and consciousness inflates the independence of systems/matrix. It is a fitting observation that capitalist societies are marked by how ‘communication contexts become distant from their organic and psychic infrastructures, from human life and conscious- ness’.i22 But to deduce from this that human subjects are no longer part of society overextends the argument. It is their social (communicative) practices which first bring this society (communication) about. It is they - as Marx has shown - which become independent with regards to them. Thus, even their independent existences have to be reproduced every day in ordinary activities, they do not detach from them. It is not anonymous market forces that create the inhuman reality of ‘sweatshops’, but those who act strategically and assume the capitalist commodity form for themselves. While they have to take on their ‘laws’, they reproduce them in their actions by claiming them for their interests, or to the contrary, by massively questioning them. Thus, the systemic independ-ences have to pass through practice, and can be questioned and shifted/moved by it. It is therefore - as I will argue later on - not a question of dualism, but rather a duality123 of practice and its effects. The demarcation, the dualism, creates in sum antinomies on both sides, which then have to be broken up with enormous effort. Because society is ejected from the individual and the individuals from society, the theory does not focus on the strategic practice of social subjects. Legal systems theory no longer analyses it on this level.124 This creates the impression that systems theory is subjectless. From this perspective a class-based analysis, for instance, has to be considered as a false personification of systemic differentiations and rejected, in favour of demonstrating how strategies of classes or other social actors are mediated in systemic processes, have to base themselves upon them and at the same time create or shift them. Precisely this participation is always already assumed on the system level. How hegemonic communication projects actually assert themselves, and in which discursive conflicts, is blocked out: ‘Inasmuch as systems theory does not form any hypothesis here, it bases itself consistently on social facts, leaves the idle question of intentions open and focuses instead on communicative events’.^5 The demarcation produces a similar problem to that in Althusser’s structuralism, of ‘abstracting the agents, as if there were ... just “place”-holding phantoms’.i26 Elaborate studies of specific conflicts and the differentiation according to forces, factions and alliances become obsolete. Ultimately, however, the abstraction cannot be consistently sustained. For who programmes the code? Who advances differentiation globally? How are contingency and change (‘evolution’) to be explained? Therefore the justification for the ‘function’ of the legal system also remains contradictory; thus Luhmann certainly notes initially that he does not mean by ‘expectations’ that are to be stabilised the actual state of consciousness of a given individual, but only the temporal aspect of the meaning of communications.127 But his further explanations are orientated towards concrete subjects. ‘One’ could thus live better, ‘one’ would have to adapt, ‘one’ tries to prepare oneself for the future, etc. At least to establish plausibility he has to briefly set aside the strict separation of society and ‘human subjects’ at this point. Here evidently the thing itself asserts itself - against the author’s intention, similarly to Kant’s attempt to explain, unempirically, the transcendental subject that is relieved of all empiricism.128 3.3 The Grand Narrative‘System’ The unresolved problem of the actors surreptitiously sneaks back into the theory. Thus, there is notably at least one basic postulate of systems theory: ‘There are systems’. The discourse on the system itself is precisely not re-introduced in comparison to other, non-systemic subjects, but singularly occupies the summit of the pyramid of concepts.129 The following constructivist deduction only aims to demonstrate theoretical requirements to be able to speak of such a system, in this way: when operative closedness - then the system has to provide its own reproduction - then the legal operations have to connect with each other. What is demonstrated is ultimately a necessity of thinking. That is, the ‘grand narrative’ of systems theory is called ‘autopoietic system’. Thus, ironically, as Andreas Weber notes, ‘in subjectless systems theory a subject-logical thinking of a new, subtle kind persists..., that is in the absolutism of the autopoietic system’?30 Precisely this system should provide a guarantee for Luhmann against ultimate metaphysical explanations beyond the social. That autopoietic systems produce and reproduce their constitutive elements through their constitutive elements themselves, was precisely meant to cut off the connection to biologistic, ontological or religious premises. Yet this is countered in renouncing a genealogical deduction and implementing the system. Weber assumes that Luhmann intentionally ignores the problem, because he is primarily concerned with excluding the subject from the development of social theory.131 However, one has to assume that this forms his hidden normative premise. Before the autopoietic turn this was still readily apparent: ‘Our existence depends on functionally differentiated large scale systems of information processing’, he states.132 ‘Within them and through them we have to relate to the world’. Certainty only exists as long as they remain operational, and to secure precisely that is the role of law ‘and its order is the just’.133 Interestingly, Habermas and the legal systems theorists share this concept of the system, as will become apparent below. It can however already be shown at this point with Habermas’ critique of Teubner. He objects that the concept is inconsistent within the terms of the theory itself [theorieimmanent], for the common, that is macro-social communication, which all systems use in Teubner, is only objectively identical and precisely not from the perspective of one of the two systems. There is, according to the premises of systems theory, no observer’s position which can identify a communicative event as the same.134 Teubner’s suggestion therefore does not sit well with the conceptualisation of law as an autopoietic system; he is upon closer inspection more of an indication of the necessity of a theory of communicative action, ‘which distinguishes a “lifeworld” bound to the medium of ordinary language from “systems” steered through special codes yet adaptively open to the environment’.^5 Habermas thus believes that he ‘catches’ Teubner in already admitting underhandedly that the necessity of a general language refers to a medium which is not entirely systemic, but encompasses the systems. But this line of reasoning is in turn only necessary for Habermas because he conceives of the functional systems which are differentiated by special codes very similarly (even if for him they are environmentally open) - that is, in such a way that action is also stopped in them. Any possibility of communicative practice therefore has to be transferred into the ‘life world’ and its vernacular (see further details below). Both theories grant the systems a problematic subject character. For in this manner the reification of social conditions is explained rather plausibly on the operative level. Subsequently, however, those social conditions and their actors, between whom the relations exist, are abstracted. Because finally only the product of human action is ‘observed’, but no longer the practice itself; also the mode of description is reified, the system acts. In this way the impression that the systems are completely remote and impenetrable is created. 3.4 ‘Queer Observations’ - Society without Gender^' As the theory spirits subjective practice away from society, it cannot conceive of gendering as a process that structures society. Thus, it is hardly surprising that gender relations are irrelevant in the great works of legal systems theory. The relationship of systems theory and gender studies is according to Ulrike Teubner one of mutual exclusion.137 A modest number of more recent approaches in gender studies shows that it is considered as a possible subject of discussion, and even relatively parallel to current discourse theory or interactionist feminist theoretical approaches^8 - making the fact that it is blocked out in legal systems theory all the more conspicuous.”翻译为中文","output":"这引发了进一步的反思，即对通信与意识或心理系统之间关系的思考。通信定理本身基于心理系统彻底个体化的前提。因为意识对彼此是不透明的，因此产生了通信的功能性必要性。因此，通信是双重偶然性的基本表达单位。但是这种通信就个别意识而言具有了自己的生命——这也是为什么“具体的人类主体”和通过交流构建的人物不应等同的原因。“心理系统”仅参与交流而不创造它，正是因为交流已经相对于那些个体变得自我参照地独立；在其“新兴秩序”中，心理仅仅是参与： 人类主体不是社会的一部分，而是以不可逾越的分离面对社会，这有一个不可避免的后果。社会和意识/身体对彼此来说在交流上是无法达到的。后者分别是独立的、自给自足的（心理或有机的）过程。 尽管两者都创造了交流，但它们无法掌控它。交流变得独立于人类主体，并就个别意识创造了自己的意义世界。 尽管Teubner与Luhmann一样认为，功能分化代表社会进步，但他仍然认为现代社会的主要危险之一是他为了强调问题而称之为“匿名矩阵”的独立交流过程。例如，经济系统的矩阵可能攻击甚至破坏人类的生存。因此，“血汗工厂”是“匿名市场力量”的后果。反抗这一点的是——必须通过更新对人权的理解来适当理解的抵抗： 这是个人的身体和意识...坚持其“法前”、“政前”甚至“社前”（额外社会的）“固有权利”的领域。身体痛苦和心理痛苦必须通过将遭受痛苦的身体和灵魂的抵抗，例如以身体暴力的形式，作为代表引入交流中，从而打破它们的沉默 这种系统理论法学理论的最前沿立场的表述显示，它确实认可行动者，与后结构主义及其去中心化自主主体的意图类似。然而，与后结构主义方法不同的是，将主体分裂成三部分坚持通信之外的东西，坚持通信与“人类主体”的分离。Teubner并不捍卫现实主义立场，因此例如在他的方法中，身体不是“实际现实”。然而，他在社会一方和“人类主体”另一方之间划定了严格的界限。不同的背景在各自的边界内产生。尽管这种二元论遵循尊重各自逻辑的意图，但它导致了两个理论问题，这最终解释了排除主体的叙述。 一方面，尽管进行了后现代的去中心化，这种方法仍然停留在传统的主体范式之内。福柯正确地对抗这一观点，认为只有在现代自然科学出现时，人体才被构建为生物实体。为了质疑两性社会构建，女性主义理论家随后证明，生物性别的身体与社会性别身份的二元论最终归结为对社会状况的自然化。身体性别不应被理解为与权力（或在这里与交流）相对抗的“根本核心或惰性物质”，而是性别装置的首批结果之一。 “性别”到底是什么？它是自然的、解剖学的、染色体的还是荷尔蒙的……所谓的性别自然事实是否由服务于其他政治和社会利益的各种科学话语在话语上产生？ 因此，身体并不是一个被文化意义保持在外部的被动媒介，而是一个文化生成的产物。在这个意义上，既没有前社会的身体，也没有前社会的心理，用系统理论的术语来说，只有‘主体’。系统的交流本身产生它们最初只声称要交流的东西。 法律主体化（我稍后将根据福柯的观点展示）共同产生了作为真实生活实践的现代主体。孤立的意识，其孤立恰恰创造了交流的必要性，这里显示为人类主体的历史特定形式，并失去了人类学基础的特征。 另一方面，通信与意识的二元论夸大了系统/矩阵的独立性。一个合适的观察是，资本主义社会的特征是“交流语境与其有机和心理基础设施、人类生活和意识相距甚远”。但由此得出人类主体不再是社会的一部分的结论过于夸张了。正是它们的社会（交流）实践首先带来了这个社会（交流）。正如马克思所展示的，它们与它们相对独立。因此，即使它们的独立存在必须在日常活动中每天被重新生产，它们也没有与之分离。创造“血汗工厂”的不人道现实不是匿名市场力量，而是那些战略性行动并为自己采用资本主义商品形式的人。虽然他们必须接受它们的“法律”，但他们通过为自己的利益声张它们，或相反，通过大规模质疑它们，在行动中再现它们。 因此，系统的独立性必须通过实践，可以通过实践被质疑和移动/转移。因此，我稍后将争论的是，这不是一个二元论的问题，而是实践及其效应的二元性问题。 这种划界，这种二元论，总的来说在双方都创造了对立，然后必须付出巨大努力来打破它们。因为社会被从个体中剔除，个体从社会中剔除，理论不关注社会主体的战略实践。法律系统理论不再在这个层面上对其进行分析。这就造成了系统理论无主体的印象。从这个角度看，例如基于阶级的分析必须被视为系统差异化的错误人格化并被拒绝，以展示阶级或其他社会行动者的策略是如何在系统过程中被中介、必须依靠它们并同时创造或转移它们。正是这种参与在系统层面上总是被假定的。霸权交流项目实际上是如何主张自己的，以及在哪些话语冲突中，被屏蔽了：“因为系统理论在这里没有形成任何假设，它始终基于社会事实，留下了意图的空闲问题，并专注于交流事件”。"},{"instruction":"received this as mail \\"Good morning We, the specialists of Tuatara Games, would like to provide to you an option for embedding of our video materials as a pre-roll at the beginning or in the middle of your channel on the occasion of exit of our new game - BARE BUTT BOXING on Steam.

It is a document which reflects about how the research is conducted, the care that has been exercised throughout the study and the findings in a manner that can be utilised for decision-making. It is observed that executives are rarely interested in the methodology adopted by the researcher in the investigation; they are interested only in the final results. From their viewpoint, the research report is the written presentation which the executive see about a project carried out by the researcher but initiated by the decision maker (executive) and it conveys the information desired by the decision maker in an understandable form. Report writing is an art, which must be learnt through hard work, practice and effort. The information and recommendations placed before the management are of little value unless they assist in making judgements and lead to decisions. Therefore, a report should be written very carefully so as to stimulate thought and lead to action. Report writers should concentrate on the collection of relevant data, organising the data and arriving at a conclusion. The contents of the report play a very important role in stimulating action. 12.2.2. Steps in Writing Reports The steps needed to prepare the project report are as follows: Step 1) Verifying the Sources of Data Collection: Verification of the sources of information is a fundamental task which should be carried out prior to the 238 Biostatistics & Research Methodology preparation of research report. The information can be collected from various primary and secondary sources. More important is the research issue, more is the verification needed. Step 2) Formulating a Rough Pattern: During the data collection, researcher notes down the significant and related information that can be included in the research report. As the researcher proceeds in noting down the information, he formulates a pattern to identify relevant and irrelevant information. Step 3) Formulating Final Pattern: On the basis of formulated rough pattern, the collected data is analysed. While analysing the data, the researcher might feel the need to collect more data, while some of the existing data may get rejected because of their unsuitability. By analysing collected data, gradually the final pattern of the research report is formulated which is continuously refined. Step 4) Making an Outline: After formulating the final pattern, an outline of the research report is made, where the researcher decides how to present the report. Various decisions to be made in this stage are related to problem statement, arrangement of various sections, and a logical sequencing is decided. Many times it is not needed, but it helps in finalising the structure of report. Step 5) Writing the First Draft: The next step is writing the first draft of report. It is a rough draft which is prepared by researcher at first. In this stage, the researcher is still in confusion between the notes and the outline of report. Hence, this draft needs refinement till it is finalised. Step 6) Presenting the Rough Draft: In this stage, a rough draft which is prepared in previous stage, is presented in front of the management. It is very important for a researcher to make the management understand what the report is trying to communicate. While preparing rough draft, it should be kept in mind that the language should be clear as well as appealing. The researcher should note down all the suggestions that are given for the improvement. Step 7) Refinement in Rough Draft: In this stage, all the refinements that are suggested by the management are made in the draft. The researcher also needs to carefully analyse the draft and make necessary changes such as adding important details, rearrangement of text, checking of grammar and spelling, etc. This refinement continues in a loop till the top management approves the report. Step 8) Evaluation of Report: After continuous refinement, an almost final report is prepared. In this stage, the top management evaluates the effectiveness of report. They analyse whether the research is completed as per the instructions or not. In this step, the reliability and the validity of the report is checked against set parameters. The report is effective when it is able to communicate the purpose of research clearly and comprehensively without hampering the quality of the report. Step 9) Present and Publish the Final Report: Once the report is finally approved after evaluation, the next thing is presenting it to the intended audience. The presentation should be effective enough to get the attention about the research objectives. This presentation can be enhanced with the help of diagrammatic representation and hand-outs, interaction with audience. Once, the report is successfully presented, it is the time to publish it so that general public can get to know about the research. Organisations can inform the common public with the help of various techniques, such as, bulletin boards, newsletters, etc. Designing the Methodology (Chapter 12) 239 12.2.3. Importance of Report Writing Project report serves many purposes for the organisation and plays a crucial role in management. Preparing a report is important due to following reasons: 1 ) Communicates the Information: Research report can be used as means of communicating facts and information to the top management or executives in the organisation. With the help of reports, ideas, suggestions, and concepts of the organisations are conveyed to their shareholders, customers, general public, top management executives, etc. Communicating information through reports allow the managers to make efficient decisions. 2) Helps in Evaluation: Research report helps the managers to re-evaluate their prevailing problem as well as to plan for future efficiently. Research reports also help various departments to co-ordinate and control their activities. Research reports assist general public in finding probable suggestions regarding their problems. 3) Facilitates Measuring Performance: Research reports can also help in evaluating performance of a particular department/organisation, town, district, state, or country. It provides relevant and complete information about the performance which in turn helps in finding out the ways for betterment. 4) Predicts Future Trends: Research reports contain the facts and figures related to some crucial incidents or occurrence that help in predicting the future occurrences. It can forecast the changing trends of consumer buying, upcoming variation in the market or economy, or need of technical advancement. 5) Helps in Making Desirable Changes: Report helps in making desirable changes in a department, organisation, market, or economy, by understanding its consequences and giving valuable suggestions. It identifies the factors responsible for poor performance of a particular plan, policy, scheme, or organisation and provides ideas or solutions to eliminate those factors so that positive changes could be implemented.","output":"The project report is a key document that communicates the outcomes of research, demonstrating the methodology, diligence, and findings in a utilizable manner for decision-making purposes. Executives, often the initiators of such projects, mainly focus on the results rather than the research methodology. The art of report writing necessitates hard work, practice, and effort, aiming to present information and recommendations that facilitate judgement and prompt action. Effective report writing involves collecting relevant data, organizing it, and deriving conclusions to stimulate action. The process of writing a project report involves several steps: 1. **Verification of Data Sources**: Ensuring the reliability of information sources is crucial. 2. **Formulating a Rough Pattern**: Noting down significant information during data collection. 3. **Formulating Final Pattern**: Analyzing data to refine the report's structure. 4. **Making an Outline**: Deciding on the report's presentation and structure. 5. **Writing the First Draft**: Preparing an initial version of the report. 6. **Presenting the Rough Draft**: Sharing the draft with management for feedback. 7. **Refinement**: Incorporating feedback and refining the draft. 8. **Evaluation of Report**: Management evaluates the nearly final report's effectiveness. 9. **Present and Publish the Final Report**: Sharing the approved report with the intended audience and the public. The importance of report writing extends across several areas: - **Communication**: It serves as a means to convey information and ideas to stakeholders. - **Evaluation**: Reports allow for the re-assessment of issues and planning. - **Performance Measurement**: They facilitate the evaluation of performance and identification of improvement areas. - **Future Trends Prediction**: Reports can forecast market or economic trends based on past and current data. - **Facilitating Change**: They offer insights and suggestions for implementing positive changes. In essence, a well-crafted project report is crucial for communicating research findings, supporting decision-making, evaluating performance, predicting trends, and facilitating organizational changes."},{"instruction":"PRESENTATION OF DATA The data that we collected are in the form of disorder. Disorderly information is obviously difficult to understand. After data classification, it becomes important that data are to be presented. The presentation of data means exhibition of the data in such a clear and attractive manner that these are easily understood and analysed. There are following methods of presentation: 1) Textual presentation, 2) Tabulation/ Tabular presentation 3) Graphical presentation 12.3.1. Textual Presentation In textual presentation the data art presented in the form of paragraph. This method is not more impressive. It is not a very effective method. It is complex for a user to single out individual figure given in a mixed way in the text and the information has to be read again and again to understand the information. The statements with numerals are described by Textual presentation. It is used to describe the data purposely to get attention to some significant data. Therefore it contians data in expository form. It is suitable for the inadequate data. Though, when many facts are involved, then this method would not be applied only, because of the problems in analysis and integrating list of facts and figures. 240 Biostatistics & Research Methodology Example 2:The 150 person interviewed, and then following complaints were noted: 1) 27 for lack of books in the library, 2) 25 for dirty play area, 3) 20 for lack of workshop apparatus, 4) 17 for a not well maintained campus structures, 5) 17 complained of unsanitary cafeteria 6) 13 complained that the food in the cafeteria is not enough, 7) 10 perceived that the teachers are not friendly, and 8) 5 complained for lack of resting place. 12.3.2. Tabulation (Tabular Presentation of Data) Tabulation is a method of presenting the data in the form of tables so that the results can be interpreted easily. The purpose of tabulation is to present maximum possible information in minimum possible space. In tabulation, the data are represented in a compact form in such a way, that the quality and utility of information is not lost. Tabulation is the final stage of data processing which provides the data for further analysis. It serves the purpose of presenting the data to the client in an aesthetic and easily understandable format. Tabulation is a kind of visual representation that aids the researchers in further analysis and interpretation as well as presentation of data in final stage. Types of Tables These tables are categorised based on the number of characters used to classify the data, and are of two types: 1) Simple Table or One-Way Table: In a one-way table, the classification is made on the basis of only one character. Since, it is the simplest form of table, hence it is also called “simple table”. For example, following table shows number of students in a particular course in a university: Students Total Students MBA 200 PGDBM 100 Total 300 2) Complex Tables: When a table is prepared on the basis of more than one characteristic, it is known as “complex table”. In such tables, more than one classification is represented. In higher level tables both the rows and columns are included. Here, the column represents the category of the item and row represents value of the item. Generally complex tables are of following types: i) Two-Way Table: Two-way tables are made with two characteristics to classify the data. It is also called “double tabulation”. Two-way tables are constructed with the help of one-way table. It is much easier to analyse a two-way table compared to one-way table. For example, following table shows the number of students in a college as per the year in the different courses: Table 12.1: No. of Students in a College (As Per the Year in the Different Course) Name of Courses No. of Students Total 2 Students nd r Year 1 Year MBA 120 80 200 PGDBM 64 36 100 Total 184 116 300 ii) Three-Way Table: When a table is constructed with the help of three interrelated characteristics, it is known as “three-way table” or “treble tabulation”. Designing the Methodology (Chapter 12) 241 By showing three characteristics at a time, a three-way table shows more information regarding a particular phenomenon compared to one-way and twoway tables. For example, following table shows the number of students in a college according to North and South region, the course, and the year of the course: North Region South Region Total Courses Students 2 nd Year 2 nd 1 Year st Year Is' Year MBA 80 60 40 20 200 PGDBM 40 12 24 24 100 Total 120 72 64 44 300 Multiple-Way Table: A multiple-way table is constructed in the same way as one-way, two-way, and three-way tables are constructed. But the difference here is that there are multiple characteristics which are used to tabulate the data. Usually these types of tables are constructed while collecting census data. These are also known as “manifold tables”. For example, following table categorises four characteristics, which are courses, graduation stream of the students, north and south region, and year: Courses Graduation Stream North Region South Region Total Students Is* Year 2 nd Year l 5 ' Year 2 nd Year MBA Arts 20 15 20 5 60 Science 30 25 10 5 70 Commerce 20 10 5 5 40 BBA 10 10 5 5 30 PGDBM Arts 10 2 6 4 22 Science 10 6 6 8 30 Commerce 10 0 6 8 24 BBA 10 4 6 4 24 Grand Total 120 72 64 44 300 As the number of characteristics increase, the complexity of tabulation also increases. It is not advisable to include more than four characteristics as the table becomes very complex and in turn creates confusion. When more than four characteristics are to be used, then more than one table can be constructed by the researcher, to reduce the complexity. 12.3.3. Graphical Presentation of Data A graph is a visual form of presentation of statistical data. A graph is more attractive than a table of figure. Even a common man can understand the message of data from the graph. Comparisons can be made between two or more phenomena very easily with the help of a graph. In a graphic mode of presentation the points or lines of various kinds are used to represent data. The most commonly used graphs for charting a frequency distribution for the general understanding of the details of the data are as follows: 1) BarCharts 2) Line Charts 3) Frequency Curve 242 Biostatistics & Research Methodology 12.3.3.1. BarCharts Bar charts are used to present the comparison of various categories in the form of horizontal and vertical bars. It is also known as bar diagrams or bar graph. Using the bar chart, one can do the comparison of various items. A bar graph contains the axis, scales, labels and bars. It is best way for the comparison of two or more values. It is used to show any kind of information, like number of employees in the last few years, number of boys and girls in a college, sales of a company, etc. Few bar graphs are clustered in various groups (these clusters have two or more than two bars), and some bar graphs show bars which are divided in various subparts to display the total effect. Example 3:Represent the following data by a bar diagram: Year Production (in tonnes) 2006 45 2007 40 2008 42 2009 55 2010 50 On x-axis: 1.5cm = 1 year On y-axis: 1 cm = 10 tonnes Year wise Distribution of Production inTonnes Solution: 60 50- •s 40- !IH20- 10 - 2006 T 2007 1 T T 2008 2009 2010 Year 12.3.3.2. Line Charts The line chart consists of numerous points interconnected through straight lines. Generally, line charts are used to denote the fluctuation in data over a given time period. It can be said that a line chart/plot/ represents the given information in form of response points connected through straight lines. It is one of the most frequently used types of graph which is used in several areas. It is quite alike a scatter diagram with the only difference of the points (generally those lying on x axis) being joined through straight lines. As the purpose of a line chart is to display the pattern over a given time period, it is drawn in chronological order. Collection of data from experiments is generally viewed through graphs, particularly in experimental sciences. For example, in case the speed of car has to be plotted for given time intervals, it can be viewed through the following data ( table below). Table Speed (ms ‘ Elapsed Time (s) ) 0 0 1 3 2 7 Designing the Methodology (Chapter 12) 243 3 12 4 20 5 30 6 45.6 Although tabular representation of data is a wonderful way to find the accurate values, yet it fails to display the emerging patterns represented through the values. For this reason, it can lead to lack of clarity on part of mixing of data. However, a tabular representation can be clearer, if it is supported with a line graph. For example, speed/time as given below: 40 | 30 1C/3 20 10 1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0 6.0 Time (s) Figure 12.2: Graph of Speed versus Time 12.3.3.3. Frequency Curve If the middle point of the upper boundaries of the rectangles of a histogram is corrected by a smooth freehand curve, then that diagram is called frequency curve. The curve should begin and end at the base line. Example 4: Draw a frequency curve from the following frequency distribution: Scores Frequency 140 - 144 2 135 - 139 2 130 - 134 2 125 - 129 4 120 - 124 5 115 - 119 9 110 - 114 6 105 - 109 4 100 - 104 3 95 -99 2 90 -94 Solution:The following step is involved for construction of graph: 1) The class groups are given in the descending order. So, if the graph is plotted ‘ as it is’, the advantage of the ‘continuity and order’ may be seriously hampered Moreover, in that case, the frequency curve would be ‘unrepresentative’. Therefore, in this case, the groups are re-written in a proper and systematic form as: Scores Frequency 90 - 94 I 95 -99 2 100 - 104 3 105 - 109 4 244 Biostatistics & Research Methodology 110 - 114 6 115 - 119 9 120 - 124 5 125 - 129 4 130 - 134 2 135 - 139 2 140 - 144 2 2) The scores (as the groups) are represented on the OX-axis. In this particular case, the scale is taken as 1 cm. = 5 group (score). Y 9 / ^ 6 5 4 3 2 1 °0 90-94 140 X -144 Frequency Curve 3) The frequencies are represented, as a variable factor, on the OY-axis. The scale is taken as 1 cm = 1 unit of frequency. 4) The rectangles are first drawn on the basis of the values given and taking into consideration the scales adjusted. 5) Then the upper-end mid-points are plotted. 6) Finally, considering all these, a freehand curve is drawn. The curve so obtained is known as the frequency curve. It is very commonly used in the study of various subjects.","output":"**Data Presentation Techniques** **Overview:** Data presentation aims to display collected information in a clear, attractive, and analyzable manner. This can be achieved through different methods, including textual presentation, tabulation, and graphical presentation, each serving specific purposes and audiences. **1. Textual Presentation:** Text presentation involves describing data in paragraph form. While this method can highlight specific important data points, it is generally less effective for analysis due to difficulty in isolating individual figures and requires multiple readings to understand fully. **Example Use:** - Highlighting specific findings or numbers within text to draw attention to them. **2. Tabulation (Tabular Presentation):** Tabulation organizes data into tables, providing a compact yet detailed presentation of information without losing quality or utility. It categorizes data based on characteristics, facilitating analysis and interpretation. **Types of Tables:** - **Simple Table (One-Way Table):** Based on one characteristic. - **Complex Tables:** - **Two-Way Table:** Incorporates two characteristics. - **Three-Way Table:** Utilizes three interrelated characteristics. - **Multiple-Way Table:** Uses more than three characteristics for highly detailed data organization. Note, however, that tables with more than four characteristics can become overly complex. **3. Graphical Presentation:** Graphical presentation uses visual elements like bars, lines, or curves to represent data, making it accessible and understandable even to those not specialized in data analysis. It's particularly effective for showing comparisons, trends, and patterns. **Types of Graphs:** - **Bar Charts:** Compare different categories using horizontal or vertical bars. - **Line Charts:** Demonstrate fluctuations in data over time, connecting data points with straight lines. - **Frequency Curve:** A smooth curve connecting the mid-points of histogram bars, useful for showing distribution tendencies. **Importance:** Effective data presentation is crucial for making informed decisions and conveying findings in an impactful manner. Each method has its strengths and should be chosen based on the dataset's nature and the audience's needs for clarity, detail, and accessibility. **Conclusion:** Choosing the right data presentation technique, whether textual, tabular, or graphical, depends on the specific goals of data analysis and the intended audience. The key is to present data in a manner that is both comprehensible and engaging, facilitating insights and decisions from the presented information."},{"instruction":"PROTOCOL 12.4. 1. Introduction A protocol is the summarising statement related to the problem, the objective of study and methodology to be followed. The protocol supports the study of all steps under execution. The main focus to study the protocol is to state the problem, objective and suggestions. According to a protocol or an action plan, clinical research is conducted.

Introduction The word ‘cohort’ is obtained from the Latin word cohors’ which means an enclosure, company or crowd. In Roman times, a cohort was a body of 300-600 infantry. In epidemiological, the cohort is defined as a group of people having something common, an exposure or involvement in population group. The cohort study is a study design in which one or more samples (called cohorts) evaluate the future and subsequent condition in relation to a disease or outcome that determine the initial participants’ risks (risk Factors) are associated with it. As the study is in progress, results from participants in every cohort are measured and relationships between their features are determined. In cohort study, a group of respondents who experience the same events during a same time interval are observed. Rather than measuring the same people, it seeks to observe different categories of people. The group of respondents should belong to the same group who experience the same. This research is “explicitly macro-analytical” in nature, which implies that the researcher considers the whole category for observing the features. An example of cohort study is measuring the changes in voter opinions during polls. One or more groups of subjects are included in a cohort study which is defined by their exposure condition and being followed through time to identify a result of disease. Their objectives are to determine whether initial exposure condition effects risk of consequential disease. 12.5.2. Concept of a Cohort Study Tracking the study population over a period of time is included in the cohort study and a feature reflected in three synonyms for this design: 1) Follow-Up, 2) Longitudinal and 3) Prospective.

Health result or health change data are obtained in the same person at the same time, and not just once as in cross-sectional studies. This is the hallmark of this design. This is related to one or more characteristics that study the risk factors or portions of the natural history of diseases in individuals. For example, future outcomes like exercise, coronary heart disease (figure 12.3 and 12.4). Two groups are identified in the base population (all ellipses) as shown in figure 12.3. Those who exercise (elliptically marked E) and those who do not (marked as NE). These groups are followed periodically to find out the number of new cases of coronary heart disease (CHD) from which time of incidence rate of the disease can be calculated. Data are collected for the creation of sampling frames and the assignment of exposure conditions and hence this is applied to retrospective cohorts too. In relation to the natural history of the disease, cohort studies are future oriented as shown in Figure 12.4. Explores natural history including disease outcomes Past Now / Future Exposure is known, outcome will be explored Figure 12.4: Natural History of Disease and Cohort Studies Within the cohort, comparisons groups are identities (e.g., people who smoke or do not smoke) but sometimes individual cohorts are initially established at the outset. The cohort study is usually searching for a specific hypothesis, which determines the nature of the comparison group. Cohort studies starts by collecting basic baseline data, usually from a cross-sectional study, or by extraction of baseline data from the census. Such cohorts are rare. For example, a regular information system such as a birth register. 12.5.3. Framework or Design of a Cohort Study Follow-up or incident studies are the other names of cohort studies. This study starts with the group of people who are free from disease and are divided into sub-groups according to possible cause of illness or results (figure 12.5). Variations of interest are defined and measured by following the whole cohort to determine how the later development of new cases of the disease varies between groups before and after exposure. Cohort studies are longitudinal, such as case-control studies as the data of exposure and disease vary at point to point in time. 250 Biostatistics & Research Methodology Time Direction of inquiry r - ] Disease i I - * [ Exposed | » --J -- ] No Disease ] People without the disease Population - 1 NE r _ ! Disease - Not Exposed p ~ [ -- I No Disease I Figure 12.5: Design of a Cohort Study 12.5.4. Types of Cohort Study According to point in time when exposure information was collected, there were following main types of cohort studies are defined: 1) Prospective Cohort Study (Concurrent or Longitudinal Cohort Study), 2) Retrospective Cohort Study (Historical Cohort or Non-Concurrent Prospective Cohort), and 3) Combination of Prospective and Retrospective Cohort Study 12.5.4.1. Prospective Cohort Study (Concurrent or Longitudinal Cohort Study) Once the study population defined, data on exposure is collect in prospective cohort studies. For example, it is possible to use the most updated methods of exposure so that bias in exposure classification can be minimized. The major drawback of this cohort study is that the time from exposure to onset of disease may be very long. The major benefits of this study are that the exposure can be determined and how it is measured can also be find out. Procedures allowing future detection and tracking of changes to be applied. If and when change in exposure status is measured. The nature of outcome measures can be found out. 12.5.4.2. Retrospective Cohort Study (Historical Cohort or Nonconcurrent Prospective Cohort) Retrospective Cohort Study is useful for situations with long induction periods, is to focus on exposure measurements made several years before the study was established and that may be available from employment, medical, or other records. Using data from existing records, the time to wait for the risk of any effect on disease can be significantly reduced or eliminated. Such type of cohort study is known as retrospective / historical cohort study. A retrospective study will: 1 ) Rely on when sufficient record are available on the exposure status and is able to find out the present disease status; 2) Identifying cohort subjects on national disease registers and may need to consider whether information about changes in exposure status is available; and what data is available on other risk factors for the disease related to the risk status, i.e. confounding factors. Designing the Methodology (Chapter 12) 251 Historical cohort studies have several disadvantages also. In past records the available exposure data are less precise and have more detailed than if they were collected prospectively. For example in historical occupational cohorts previous exposure measurements made in the working environment are rarely available and hence variables such as work project or professional society are generally used to categorize individual exposure. In previous exposure measurement this process reduces inaccuracies, but the stability of the biological marker during long periods of storage is often unknown and the number of such biological sample banks is limited.

Combination of Prospective and Retrospective Cohort Study In this, the representation of a combination of prospective and retrospective cohorts have been designed and utilized. According to Hennekens and Buring this mixture of prospective and retrospective cohort as occurring in ambidirection. This means that the data are collected both prior to and following an exposure of interest. The ability to explore both the possible short-and long-term effects of an exposure is the main benefit of hybrid cohort study design. These are the combinations of both retrospective and prospective elements. The date of the outcome is assessed by identifying the cohort from previous records and then followed up in the future for further assessment of the result, for example, Court -Brown and Doll in the study of radiation effects. In year 1955, they assembled a cohort consisting of 13,352 patients who received large doses of radiation therapy between 1934 and 1954 for ankylosing spondylitis. The result was death from leukemia or aplastic anemia. 12.5.5. Steps in Planning a Cohort Study The steps to conduct cohort study are given below: 1) Selection of Subjects (Source of the Study Population ): The choice of subjects is determined by the repetition of exposure and the requirement to obtain complete and important information about both exposure and result on entire the study subjects. 252 Biostatistics & Research Methodology Sufficient numbers of subjects may be enrolled from various sources for relatively common exposures such as cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, bottle feeding, etc. In the case of rare exposures, specific groups may need to be considered, for example, exposure to radiation or industrial toxins, etc. These exposure cohorts allow assessment of rare conditions. 2) Selection of Comparison Groups: When the source of the exposed subjects is determined, the other step is to choose a suitable comparison group of unexposed individuals. This step is most important in the design of a cohort study. The unexposed group must be equal to the exposure group with respect to the distribution of all factors, except for the exposures under analysis. The following are the two main types of comparison group that may be used in a cohort study: i) Internal Comparison Group: Using an internal comparison group, members of the general population can be classified into other exposure categories because general population cohorts are heterogeneous in relation to multiple exposures. This means that the experience of members of the cohort who are either unexposed or exposed to low levels can be used as a comparison group. ii) External Comparison Group: In the case of exposure to the suspected component when the cohort is essentially equal, a similar but unexposed cohort, or some other standard of comparison, is required to evaluate the exposed group.For example, it is not possible to identify a subgroup of cohorts in some occupational groups that may be considered to be 'unexposed' for comparison. In this example, an external comparison group must be used. 3) Measurement of Exposure: This is an important aspect in the design of a cohort study. The pattern of exposures (intermittently vs. stable), and changes over time and the dates on which the exposure began and stopped, are the information that must be first obtained in the exposure. The amount of detail may not be sufficient for the study nor are the details of potential confounding factors likely to be adequately recorded. But the use or pre-existing record saves time and cost. In most situations, details obtained from pre-existing records should be supplemented by interviews, questionnaires, physical exams and laboratory tests. The information gathered at the time of enrolment about changes in employment, work patterns, life-style, diet and so on, needs to be updated at each follow-up. 4) Measurement of Confounding Variables: Participants are not randomly allocated to different exposure categories because cohort studies are observational studies. This can cause differences among groups in terms of risks other than being studied. This only matters if these other risks under study are also risk factors for the particular disease (or other outcome), that is, if these exposures are varying. Thus, if an occupational risk is studied in relation to lung cancer, it is essential to ensure that the ‘exposed’ and ‘unpublished’ groups have a similar smoking history. 5) Measurement of Outcome(s): To obtain complete and unbiased information about the result in every subject is the main goal of all cohort studies. The common methods of recording outcomes are like hospital records, physical examination, laboratory tests, questionnaires and interviews. The main issue is that the procedures used for recording results should be applied homogenously to all groups. One main advantage of cohort studies is that one can examine the effect of a specific exposure on multiple results. Several cohort studies use existing routine monitoring systems to detect results of interest. Such systems include cancer registries, death certificates, and others. They Designing the Methodology (Chapter 12) 253 allow monitoring of the subjects of the study and do so at a much lower cost than tracing their results if it is necessary to contact the subjects. However, it is possible to examine the results of only those types that have been routinely recorded by these systems and the way they are coded. This is essential in studies lasting several decades, as major changes can be introduced during the study to detect diseases can be determined by these surveillance systems. 6) Follow-up: Methods should be determined at the beginning of the study to ensure adequate adherence to the subjects studied. In general, this includes periodic contacts with individuals such as home visits, telephone calls or mailed questionnaires. Costudy of conditions with a long induction period is necessary to follow a large number of subjects over several years. This is clearly a very large and expensive enterprise. To reduce these difficulties, many groups are defined as membership of a particular group (occupational body, occupational pension scheme, association, health insurance scheme, college alumni), with more ease of study population Can be followed. For example, if the death is the result, then all cohort members can know the important status on that date. All subjects of interest whose vital status is known at that date must contribute the person-time at risk by that date. Those whose vital status is not known at that date should be considered as lost in follow-up’ and the last date for which their vital status was known was taken as the person at risk. 7) Analysis (Attributable Risk, Relative Risk, and Population Attributable Risk): Measuring the incidence of disease in exposed and unexposed exposure and comparing them is the first step of analysis of a cohort study. Researchers typically seek to compare frequency of disease in two or more diseases, which differ for some potential risk factor. Several measures of the relationship between risk and disease are used to compare risks. These measures of effect are as follows: i) Attributable Risk (AR): AR is the risk difference, which measure the answer to the question “What is the additional risk following exposure that experienced by people who are not exposed?” AR = Incidence in Exposed -Incidence in Not Exposed ii) Relative Risk (RR): RR is the risk ratios which focus on the question “How many times more likely are exposed persons to get the disease relative to nonexposed persons?” This is not giving the information about the magnitude of absolute risk. In the case of uncommon diseases, the value of absolute risk may be very small for a large RR. Incidence in Exposed RR = Incidence in Non - Exposed AR is a more meaningful measure of risk in most clinical situations because it represents a real additional likelihood of the disease in people being exposed. iii) Population Attributable Risk: This is measure that focus on the question “How much does a risk factor contribute to the overall rates of disease in a population?” Such information is useful in deciding which risk factors are necessary and which are feasible for public health. 254 Biostatistics & Research Methodology Population Attributable Risk = AR x Prevalence of Risk Factor in the Population under Study Population attribute risk is a measure of excess frequency of disease in a group related with the frequency of a risk factor. Population Attributable fraction is a fraction of the incidence of disease that is related with a particular risk factor. Population Attributable Fraction = PopulationAttributable Risk TotalIncidenceof Diseasein the Population In case, all cohort members were following the same period of time, then risk can be determined as the measure of incidence of disease in each group (table 12.3 a). For example, in case of the period of five years, the five year risk can be determined separately for the exposed and unexposed groups. The calculation of Risk ratio and risk difference can be done as measures the relative and absolute effect, respectively. In case, the study subjects have unequal periods then this must be taken into consideration in the analysis. The follow-up period may vary in case, subjects were recruited into the study population for long time or in case, some were lost to follow-up during the study (e.g., exiting from the area). The method to handle variable follow-up periods is to determine the rates that use person-years at risk as a denominator (Table 12.3 b). With this method, each subject contributes to the population at risk only as several years of observation as anyone actually observed. Hence in case, the subject leaves after 1 year, one contributes 1 person-year; in case after 8, 8 person-years.

Advantages of a Cohort Study Following are the various advantages of cohort study: 1) With the help of cohort study, subject can be matched and which limit the effect of the confounding variable. 2) With cohort study, it is possible to standardize the outcome. Designing the Methodology (Chapter 12) 255 3) This study is simple and affordable than a Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT). 4) In case the study groups have been selected in suitable manner they allow direct calculation of incidence rather than an odds ratio. For measuring incidence, cohort designs can be considered as a powerful strategy. 5) It is the best available observational studies as replaces the true experimental studies. 12.5.7. Disadvantages of a Cohort Study Following are the various disadvantages of cohort study: 1) In case the result is unique; a huge number of people must enter the study and be followed for a long time before results come. This has implications for costs with regard to staff, transportation and time. Cohort studies are more efficient for general results, and not for rare diseases. 2) Initially the conditions may be present but, asymptomatic and clinically undiagnosed. 3) There is no randomness in the cohort study which means that imbalances in patient characteristics may exist. 4) In this study, blinding / masking are difficult. 5) In a cohort study, result of interest may take long time to occur","output":"# Summary of Cohort Studies Introduction to Cohort Studies - Origin: The term \\"cohort\\" stems from Latin \\"cohors,\\" meaning a group with common characteristics. - Definition: A cohort study follows groups (cohorts) over time to investigate how certain factors affect disease outcomes. - Purpose: Identifies and analyzes relationships between risk factors and disease by observing varied groups. Concept and Design - Nature: Prospective, follows a population over time to study the development of outcomes relative to exposures or characteristics. - Key Features: Follow-up, longitudinal, and prospective studies tracking population to reveal relationships between exposures and outcomes. Types of Cohort Studies 1. **Prospective Cohort Study**: Monitors a group following the identification of exposure up to the outcome manifesting, characterized by direct current data collection. 2. **Retrospective Cohort Study**: Utilizes historical data to examine exposures and subsequent outcomes, often relying on existing records. 3. **Combination of Prospective and Retrospective**: Incorporates elements from both, allowing study of short-and long-term exposure effects.

Introduction The method involving the systematic recording and assessment of behavioural forms of a particular individual (or group of individual), object or event so as to collect desired information about a research problem without any personal communication is called ‘Observation’ . Here, the observer observes the object from a suitable distance or through audio-video recordings. The information is recorded for future use. The respondents may be observed in their natural environment or a contrived environment is designed for the purpose. The approach for observation may be direct or indirect, structured or unstructured. The observation method is very popular for behavioural science researches. Every individual observes certain things around him/her but it cannot be termed as scientific observation. Scientific observation is the observation where a particular research problem is the focus of the observation. A systematic planning and controlling is required for recording such observations. Different validity and reliability check measures are used here so as to collect accurate information. 12.6.2. Types of Observation: Observational Methods Types of observations are as follows: 1) Participation and Non-participation Observation: This classification is based on the type of role played by the observer/researcher as a particular or non-participant in the process of observation. At one end is the complete participant, moving to the participant-as-observer, then to the observer-as-participant, and finally to the complete observer (non-participant observer). The move is from complete participation or attachment to complete non-participation or detachment. Participation and non-participation observation can take following forms: i) Participant-As-Observer: As a participant-as-observer, the researcher would take a more participatory role in the organisation’s activities. This role might be an established one, e.g., as an employee within the organisation. 256 Biostatistics & Research Methodology ii) Observer-As-Participant: Further along the dimension, at the point when an observer starts to act as d participant, there would be more interaction with those being researched. It is likely that the observations would be carried out in a naturalistic selling and the participants would be aware that they were being observed. iii) Full -Observer: As a full-observer, the researcher will have minimal contact, or no contact at all, with the research participants. This would apply, e.g., to psychology laboratory research where there would be limited interaction between the experimenter and participants. 2) Structured and Unstructured Observation: Structured observation is used when the research problem has been formulated precisely and the researcher is told to observe the area of study. The researchers are asked to record their observations. In structured observation the problem has been clearly defined, hence the behaviour to be observed and the method by which it will be measured is specified in detail. On the other hand unstructured observation implies that the researchers are free to observe whatever they feel relevant and judicious. In unstructured analysis is used in situations where the problem has not been clearly defined hence it cannot be pre specified whatever we have to specified. It involves researchers watching participants and recording behaviours they feel are relevant to the study being conducted. 3) Disguised and Undisguised Observation: With the disguised observation approach, participants do not know they are being observed. This can be done through video cameras, one-way mirrors, electronic measures such as website cookies, or even human observers who look and act like another customer or perhaps one of the employees. Here, the subject or informants do not know that they are being observed. In disguised observation the respondents are unaware that they are being observed. Their behaviour is observed using one way mirrors, hidden cameras or other devices. In Undisguised observation the respondents are aware that they being observed. This approach may help encourage the customer to act normally and not be affected by the researcher’ s presence, though some individuals may alter their behaviour or chokes specifically because they know they are being watched. 4) Observation under Natural Setting and Laboratory Setting: Observations in field studies are in their natural setting and are studied in extremely realistic conditions. Sometimes, an experimental manipulation may be introduced in a field study. The primary advantage of using a natural setting is that researchers do not interfere with customers and thus observations are natural reactions. Even if consumers know they are being watched, they will still tend to act more naturally than they may in a laboratory or contrived setting. Observation in a laboratory setting, on the other hand, enables the observer to control extraneous variables, which influence the behaviour of people. Observational studies in laboratory settings have certain advantages over field studies. They enable the collection of data promptly and economically and in addition, permit the use of more objective measurements. 5) Direct and Indirect Observation: In direct observation, the behaviour of a person is observed. Most observation research is direct observation, which involves researchers watching participants as the behaviour is taking place. This approach allows researchers to observe not only the behaviour, but also any words spoken and even body language. For example, for observing purchase behaviour of shopper for a tea packet, a researcher can stand in a big grocery store just aside the shelf that contains tea packets. He can systematically record the behaviour of flue shoppers Designing the Methodology (Chapter 12) 257 such as their first pick (choice) from the shelf, their preference for the hard pack, jar pack, or poly pack; their inclination for a particular brand; impact of price (as the shopper picks a pack and places it back on the shelf after seeing the price), and so on. On the other hand indirect observation implies that same record of past behaviour is observed, the behaviour is not observed, and rather its effects are observed. Here the observer engaged in indirect observation generally looks for physical traces of behaviour or occurrence of an event. In indirect observation, the researcher observes outcome of behaviour rather than observing the behaviour. For example, a researcher can count the number of cups in which tea is consumed in a product demonstration to note the consumer preference for a particular brand or taste. 6) Human-Mechanical Observation: Here observations are done by manually or by machines. Most of the studies in marketing research are based on human observation where in trained observers are required to observe and faithfully record their observations. Humans have the advantage of being able to observe another person’s entire repertoire of behaviours from actions to body language to words spoken. Significant data could be missed if a mechanical device were used. However, that ability to fully observe could also result in failure to accurately notice various behaviours if the actions occur too rapidly or the researcher is distracted by another person, the environment, or even the subject' s actions that are not part of the study. In some cases, mechanical devices such as eye cameras and audiometers are used for observation. One of the major advantages of electrical/ mechanical devices is that their recordings are free from subjective bias. As against this advantage, such observations may be less valid than human observations. This is because the observer’s power of integration can lead to a more valid evaluation of the observation. 12.6.3. Process of Conducting Observation The researchers need to employ observation in a scientific way since it is used as a research technique or a data collection tool which enables them to find out the answers for the various research questions. In order to accomplish this objective, the following steps are required to be adopted by the researchers or observers: Step 1: Planning for Observation: The first and foremost step in the process of observation is planning. One should not conduct any observation activity in a hasty or unplanned manner. This activity should be planned with care and complete analysis should be done before implementing it. In order to conduct the various activities as planned, the questions such as who, how, when, what, why and where related to the observation activities must be replied by the researcher. By giving concern to the above mentioned issues, a researcher can formulate an appropriate plan which will help him in executing the observational activities. Following factors must be taken care by the researchers (as advised by Sukhia et.al.) while using observational method as a tool of research: 1) All the particular behaviours or activities which are to be observed should be defined clearly. 2) Group or cluster of subjects to be observed should be defined. 3) Scope of the method should be defined, i.e., either individual or group. 4) Number of observation sessions, duration of observation sessions and the time lag between two different observation sessions should be determined. 5) Also the position of the observer, the instrument used and the recording format should be determined. 258 Biostatistics & Research Methodology 6) Certain special conditions which may be necessary for the subjects should be defined. 7) In order to record the observations, suitable tools should be designed. 8) Required training should be acquired to be an expert observer. Step 2: Execution and Recording of Observation: Whatever planning was done in the first step is now required to be executed in appropriate manner. Efficient execution and recording activities undertaken by the observer becomes the key for successful observation. In order to accomplish this objective, below mentioned points must be taken care of: 1) Based on the setting of observation, i.e., natural or artificial environment, the factors and situations concerning the subject should be determined. No specific setting is required for observation in natural environment, whereas, various factors and situations need to be designed for observing the subject in the artificial environment. Some of the examples of such activities can be creating rapport with the subjects, favourable encouraging environment, seating arrangement for the subjects, and so on. 2) In order to record the on-going activities of the observation, it is important for the observer to be careful, alert and attentive. The various things which are to be observed must be recorded properly by arranging suitable tools. If during the observation, one is not in condition to record the observed points, then these points should be remembered and noted down as soon as possible after the observation. 3) Higher level of objectivity has to be maintained by the observer while observing, classifying and recording the things and events. This can be achieved by minimising the impacts put on by observer’s personal values, biases, attitudes, likes and dislikes on the outcomes of the observation. 4) The following methods are mainly used by observers for recording the observations: i) Utilising rating scales, observation schedule, checklists, blank forms and score cards. ii) Use of narratives, i.e., using own words for elaborating the things which are being observed. iii) Using various technological and mechanical devices such as mechanical counters, audio and videotape recorders, video tapes, stopwatches, one way mirror rooms ( so that observers can see the subjects without being noticed by them), concealed microphones and video tapes, motion pictures or films, computer technology, binoculars, audiometer, camera, etc. Step 3: Interpretation of the Observed Results or Findings: In this step, the interpretation of recorded and categorised observation data is done so that the various research questions can be answered. In deriving suitable and valid conclusions and inferences from the observations which are recorded, special cautions must be taken by the observers. The obtained conclusions and inferences should have objectivity, validity and reliability on part of the observer/researcher. In order to generate the appropriate and genuine interpretations of the observation, the researcher should not have any kind of confusion, prejudices,subjectivity biases or rigidity. 12.6.4. Significance of Observ ation Following points highlight the significance of observation method: 1) Suitable for Non-verbal Behaviour: Generally,survey method is used to collect the verbal information from different respondents, but in case of collecting information through non-verbal behaviour, observation method is useful. In-depth information about the respondent can be collected through observing his/her behaviour. 2) In-depth Information: Due to prolonged closeness between the observer and the respondent, a healthy and informal relationship is developed between them. The closeness increases with the time. It leads to exploration of in-depth and private information from the respondent. Designing the Methodology (Chapter 12) 259 3) Free from Biasness: As the behaviour of the respondent is observed in natural setting, it is free from biasness. Genuine and reliable information is generated through observation method. 4) Useful in Longitudinal Analysis: Observation method is very useful for longitudinal analysis as the observation may be continued to prolonged period. 12.6.5. Limitations of Observation Different limitations of observation method are as follows: 1) Lack of Control: In observation method, the most critical point is the nature of control. It is not possible for the observer to control the natural variables affecting the behaviour of the respondent. 2) Difficulties of Quantification: Another limitation of observation method is the absence of quantification of data. The behaviours of respondents cannot be quantified, only the nature of their behaviour may be described for research purpose. 3) Small Sample: Observation method is based on small samples, thus, these may not be the representative of the total population. 4) Costly: In order to observe large samples, more observers need to be assigned. As the observation method is time-taking, more remuneration is required to pay for observers. 5) Difficult to Obtain Permission: In cases, where the observer is required to observe a particular institution or organisation, permission is to be taken from the administrator. It is not easy to get permission in such cases.","output":"**Summary of Observational Studies** # Introduction Observational studies involve the systematic recording of behaviors, events, or conditions without direct interaction with the subjects.

Here's how you can update your code to incorporate a validation set: 1. **Modify \`data_generator\` to accept and handle splitting:** Update the \`data_generator\` function to include a new parameter, \`mode\`, which determines whether the generator yields training or validation data. Then, use a portion of each chunk for validation based on a specified split ratio. 2. **Split data in generator:** Within the modified \`data_generator\`, use a simple method to split the chunk into training and validation data. 3. **Adjust model fitting to include validation data:** Update the \`model.fit()\` call to include validation data by creating a separate generator instance for validation.

Here's a breakdown of how this system classifies planets, their seas, special traits, and the aerosol classification system for gaseous planets: # Type of Planets: 1. **Rocky (Selenian):** These are planets with a solid surface, similar to Earth's moon or Mercury. 2. **Terramare (Earth-like, \\"land-sea\\"):** Planets with significant amounts of both land and water, similar to Earth. 3. **Ocean:** Worlds covered entirely by oceans, without visible land. 4. **Desert (Martian):** Planets with dry, desert-like conditions, comparable to Mars. 5. **Gaseous (Jovian):** Large planets composed mostly of gas, like Jupiter and Saturn. 6. **Ice:** Planets where the surface is predominantly ice. # Types of Seas: These are variations based on the composition of seas on Terramare and Ice planets, ranging from water (H2O) to exotic substances like neon (Ne) and helium (He). # Special Traits of Planet: - **Cytherean:** Similar to Venus, with greenhouse effects and obscured vision due to clouds. - **Europan:** Possibly alluding to worlds with subsurface oceans, similar to Jupiter's moon Europa. - **Nyctonian:** Imagines starless Terramare planets with ecosystems existing without sunlight. - **Chthonian:** Typically refers to a planet that has lost its gaseous outer layers, often through close proximity to its star, exposing a rocky core. # Aerosol Classification System: This system categorizes gaseous planets based on the composition of their clouds or hazes. Each category, represented by a letter, denotes a specific type of aerosol, from clear and pristine clouds (Frigidian) to complex hazes of sulfur and organosulfur (Thiosulfian), and further to unique compositions involving silica, refractory metals, and soot. The colors associated with each classification offer a visual cue to what one might observe when viewing these planets from a distance. This detail adds another layer to the scientific study and popular understanding of extraterrestrial weather patterns and atmospheric compositions. Lastly, the \\"Climatonomic classification system\\" provides insight into the behavior of clouds or hazes relative to the temperature ranges on gaseous planets, distinguishing between those that are permanently in place without raining, those that do precipitate, and those existing above typical temperature ranges without rainfall.
