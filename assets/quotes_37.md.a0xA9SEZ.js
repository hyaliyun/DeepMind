But in this case in San Diego, California, scientists for the first time recorded the utterances, did an acoustic analysis and were surprised to find a rhythm similar to that of human speech, Sam Ridgway of the National Marine Mammal Foundation reported on Monday.  The sounds marking is quite special : Whales make sounds through the system of the nose, unlike people, who use their throat. So this particular with whale had to make some tricky  muscular and blowhole adjustments. \\"Such obvious effort suggests motivation for relatin\\", said Ridway, the main author of a study featured in the journal Current Biology. \\"The sounds we heard were clearly an example of vocal learning by the white whale.\\" The wale, named Noc, died five years ago. Ridgway says that back in 1984, he and others started hearing sounds near the whale and dolphin enclosure that recalled two people speaking in the distance, too far away to be understood. The sounds were later traced to one particular white whale when a diver in its tank came to the surface because he thought he heard colleagues tell him to do so. Noc had lived among dolphins and other white whales and had often been in the presence of humans. The whale made human-like sounds for around four years until it reached the age of sexual maturity, Ridgway said. What would be the best title for the text?

A:","output":"Bob Dylan, born Robert Allen Zimmerman on May 24, 1941, in Duluth, Minnesota, is an American singer-songwriter, author, and visual artist, whose career spans over six decades. Widely regarded as one of the greatest songwriters of all time, Dylan is known for his poetic lyrics, unique voice, and his blending of various music genres. He is primarily associated with folk, rock, blues, and country music, but his repertoire expands beyond those genres as well. Dylan's songs often touch on themes like social issues, politics, and philosophical ideas. Throughout his career, Bob Dylan has released numerous studio albums, each with its unique collection of songs and themes. Some of his most iconic songs include: 1. \\"Blowin' in the Wind\\" (1963): This song is a social commentary on the civil rights movement, war, and human rights. It was released on his second album, \\"The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan.\\" 2. \\"The Times They Are a-Changin'\\" (1964): Another politically charged anthem that captures the spirit of change and social upheaval during the 1960s. 3. \\"A Hard Rain's a-Gonna Fall\\" (1963): A protest song dealing with the Cold War fears, critique of society, and the potential for nuclear war. 4. \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\" (1965): One of Dylan's greatest achievements, this song marked his transition from acoustic folk music to a more rock-oriented sound. 5. \\"Mr. Tambourine Man\\" (1965): A song that is often interpreted as a reflection on artistic inspiration and the desire for escape from everyday life. 6. \\"Tangled Up in Blue\\" (1975): From his critically acclaimed album \\"Blood on the Tracks,\\" this song explores themes of nostalgia, memory, and the complexity of relationships. 7. \\"Hurricane\\" (1976): This song follows the story of the boxer Rubin \\"Hurricane\\" Carter, who was wrongfully accused of murder, highlighting issues of racial injustice and prejudice in the American justice system. 8. \\"Knockin' on Heaven's Door\\" (1973): Originally composed for the film \\"Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid,\\" this song deals with themes of mortality, spirituality, and the search for solace amidst personal hardship. 9. \\"Subterranean Homesick Blues\\" (1965): A fast-paced song showcasing Dylan's wordplay, wit, and his unique lyrical style influenced by beat poetry and the blues. 10. \\"Don't Think Twice, It's All Right\\" (1963): A bittersweet breakup song characterized by its introspective lyrics and poignant melody. Apart from singing his own songs, Bob Dylan is also well-known for covering songs by other artists, which allowed him to showcase his versatility and pay homage to his musical influences. Some of these covers include \\"House of the Rising Sun\\" (a traditional folk song), \\"All Along the Watchtower\\" (originally by Jimi Hendrix), and \\"Make You Feel My Love\\" (popularly covered by Adele). In conclusion, Bob Dylan's singing career touches on a vast array of topics, styles, and themes, making it challenging to summarize his entire repertoire succinctly. Nonetheless, his powerful lyrics, distinctive voice, and ability to evolve musically over time continue to resonate with audiences worldwide, solidifying his status as one of the most influential artists in modern music history."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Choices:  - confusion - anger - sadness - loss of innocence - frustration  The rationale to choose \\"confusion\\" as the answer is that: Answer:","output":"Confusion is the most accurate choice among the options provided as a problem that children may face when learning about the world. The rationale for choosing \\"confusion\\" is based on the following factors: 1. Cognitive development: Children's cognitive abilities are constantly developing, and their understanding of complex concepts is often limited. This can lead to confusion when they encounter new or challenging information about the world. Their brain is yet to develop a complete understanding of abstract thinking, logic, and reasoning. 2. Limited knowledge and experience: Children have limited knowledge and experience compared to adults, so they may not fully comprehend the intricacies and complexity of the world around them. This can make certain aspects of learning confusing and overwhelming, as they're often exposed to an immense amount of new information. 3. Ineffective communication: Sometimes, children might become confused if the information presented to them is unclear, contradictory, or too difficult to understand. This can be due to the way the information is conveyed, differences in language, or cultural barriers. 4. Emotional reactions: Children may experience a range of emotions while learning about the world, and these emotions can contribute to confusion. Feeling overwhelmed, anxious, or insecure might affect their ability to process new information effectively. 5. Social influences: The opinions and attitudes of peers and authority figures can influence a child's learning process. If there are mixed or conflicting messages coming from different sources, it can be confusing for the child to discern which information is accurate or relevant. While anger, sadness, loss of innocence, and frustration may be experienced by children when learning about the world, confusion stands as the most common and overarching issue among them. It encompasses their cognitive limitations, lack of knowledge and experience, communication barriers, emotional reactions, and the influence of external factors on their understanding of the world."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Tell them what you are sick with, the flu or whatever other illness it may be. Also let them know you are intending to come to work, but will take precautions to limit spreading the disease.  Letting your boss and coworkers know you are sick can also help them take measures to protect themselves. This is also a good time to ask if you can take the day off. Try saying something like, “I don’t want to get my coworkers sick and I don’t think that I will be at my best today. Is it okay if I stay home to rest and recover from this illness?” If you must go to work, then it is important to cover your mouth when you cough. Turning away to avoid coughing on another worker or covering it up with your hands is a good idea. Have tissues nearby or on your person to cover up your cough. If you can get antibacterial tissues do so. Dispose of any used tissues immediately and take care they don’t come in contact with other surfaces. If you’re in close quarters try to aim your cough at empty space or a wall. The same goes for sneezing. Your hands are one of the easiest ways you can contaminate surfaces or other workers. You’ll need to wash your hands more frequently, and thoroughly while sick at work with the flu or similar illnesses. Go to your workplace’s bathroom or wash station and run your hands under warm water and soap for 20 seconds each time. If soap is not available then have soap-less (usually alcohol based) hand sanitizer with you at all times and use it often. Use it especially before and after making hand to hand contact with another person. Having a spray can of disinfectant can help protect coworkers from contamination via surfaces. Spray handles, desk areas, seats, and if safe to do so, electronic peripherals (like a keyboard or mouse) that you might share with other coworkers. Spray down restroom surfaces in the workplace you touch too. There are any number of disinfectant sprays you can get in a store. Have one at your work station, desk, and bathroom so you can spray any surfaces you touch. This includes tools, computers, and even food. In cases where you store food at work you might want to put a note that you are sick so others know not to make contact with your food containers or mix up items you need to help your recovery. If your boss is wary of you spraying electronics with disinfectant then you might ask if the ones you touch can be isolated. This way only you are touching potentially contaminated surfaces. This applies to any other tools you may use on the job. If you are coughing and sneezing then you might ask to be allowed to work in a separate area of the office or workplace so you aren’t in close proximity to other employees. Ask your boss if you can take breaks at different times or locations so you don’t expose coworkers to your germs. If you can limit the time your coworkers and you are in the same place while you are contagious then you will reduce their exposure to your illness. Avoiding contact with others is the best way to prevent your infecting them with the flu or other illness. If you must go to work then in addition to disinfecting items and quarantining them you can alter your schedule if workflow permits so your coworkers aren’t physically close to you while you are ill. This can also allow more time to disinfect break room surfaces by you or any cleaning staff. Take advantage of separate break times to recover more of the energy you might be losing due to the illness. Summary:","output":"When you're sick, let your boss and coworkers know, try to stay home or take precautions at work like covering coughs, washing hands, and disinfecting surfaces to avoid spreading germs."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What should we not think about in college? What do you think about college?","output":"No, the following two questions are not the same: 1. What should we not think about in college? 2. What do you think about college? The first question, \\"What should we not think about in college?\\" is asking for advice on what topics or concerns might be detrimental or counterproductive to focus on while attending college. This question assumes that there are certain thoughts or concerns that would negatively impact a student's experience in college and seeks guidance on which issues to avoid. The answer to this question might discuss several aspects: - Avoiding unhealthy distractions: Students should try to maintain a balance between academic work, extracurricular activities, social life, and self-care. Getting too caught up in personal drama, excessive partying, or over-involvement in non-academic activities can compromise a student's academic success. - Minimizing negative self-talk: Negative self-talk, such as generalizing failures, overemphasizing negative outcomes, or frequently feeling overwhelmed, can be detrimental to a student's mental health and academic performance. Students should try to focus on fostering a growth mindset and seek support when needed. - Avoiding unnecessary stressors: College is already demanding, so excessive worries about future career prospects or dwelling too much on past mistakes can impair a student's ability to focus on the present and perform well in their studies. - Not obsessing over grades: College is not only about achieving perfect grades. Students should also focus on developing skills, networking, exploring interests, and enriching their overall educational experience. The second question, \\"What do you think about college?\\" is asking for an individual's opinion or perspective on college in general. This question is broader, encompassing personal experiences, ideals, or broader concepts related to college. An answer to this question might entail: - The purpose or value of attending college: Some people view college as an essential step for gaining knowledge, developing critical thinking skills, or obtaining qualifications, while others may see it as more optional, depending on one's career path and interests. - Personal experience and satisfaction: Depending on an individual's perspective, they may have had positive, negative, or mixed experiences when it comes to college. Some may find it academically fulfilling and transformative, while others may struggle with the demanding workload, social aspects, or financial burden. - A reflection on the college system: This might involve discussing the pros and cons of various aspects of college, such as the traditional lecture-style teaching, the cost of tuition, the availability of resources, and the role of colleges in addressing societal needs or inequalities. - The role of college in today's society: An individual could discuss how the perception and importance of college have changed over time and whether it remains a valuable investment given the rising costs and evolving job market. In conclusion, the two questions are not the same as the first one addresses concerns or thoughts to avoid while attending college, while the second one seeks to gather a broader perspective on college in general from an individual's point of view."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Please briefly summarize this news article: John McAfee Returns to US, Admits Playing 'Crazy Card' John McAfee's month-long international run from police through two Central American nations ended with a flight to Miami, where the businessman who says he abandoned his fortune admitted to playing the \\"crazy card.\\" As a gaggle of media waited near several exit doors at the airport Wednesday night, federal authorities whisked the founder of McAfee anti-virus software off the plane and into a van. \\"They said, 'Mr. McAfee, please step forward,'\\" McAfee, 67, later told ABC News exclusively overnight at a Miami Beach hotel. \\"I was met by a dozen or maybe fewer officers. I said, 'Am I arrested?' They said, 'No, sir, I am here to help you.' That felt the best of all.\\" He eventually snuck out of the airport in a cab and headed to South Beach. After walking down famed Ocean Drive to the bewilderment of tourists and eating sushi, his first meal in three days, he sat down with ABC News and admitted to playing the \\"crazy card\\" and says he is broke. \\"I have nothing now,\\" McAfee said. He claims he left everything behind in Belize, including 20 million in investments and about 15 properties. \\"I've got a pair of clothes and shoes, my friend dropped off some cash.\\" Just hours earlier, the self-made millionaire was deported by Guatemalan police who forced him aboard his U.S.-bound flight away from the home and the two women he said he loves. After he arrived on South Beach, he said, a mysterious \\"Canadian friend\\" ordered another man he'd never met to drop off a wad of fresh 5 bills that McAfee later displayed to ABC News, pulling them from his coat pocket. He says he left his fortune, including a beachfront compound, behind after his neighbor Greg Faull was found shot to death in Belize on Nov. 10. John McAfee Collapses at Detention Center After Arrest John McAfee Arrested in Guatemala Overnight Belize officials said he isn't a suspect, but when they asked to question him, McAfee disguised himself and ran. After three weeks ducking authorities in Belize, by hiding in attics, in the jungle and in dingy hotels, he turned up in Guatemala Dec. 3. Barely a day later he was detained for entering the country illegally. As Guatemala officials grappled with how to handle his request for asylum and the Belize government's demand for his deportation, McAfee fell ill. The mysterious illness, described by his attorney alternately as a heart ailment or a nervous breakdown, led to a scene with reporters chasing his ambulance down the narrow streets of Guatemala City and right into the emergency room, where McAfee appeared unresponsive. He now says it was all a ruse: \\"It was a deception but who did it hurt? I look pretty healthy, don't I?\\" He says he faked the illness in order to buy some time for a judge to hear his case and stay his deportation to Belize, a government he believes wants him dead. When asked whether he believes Belize officials where inept, he didn't mince words. \\"I was on the run with a 20-year-old girl for three and a half weeks inside their borders and everyone was looking for me, and they did not catch me,\\" he said. \\"I escaped, was captured and they tried to send me back. Now I'm sitting in Miami. There had to be some ineptness.\\" The man who many believe only wants attention answered critics who called his month-long odyssey and blog posts a publicity stunt by simply saying, \\"What's a better story, millionaire mad man on the run. You [the media] saved my ass. Because you paid attention to the story. As long as you are reporting, it is hard to whack somebody that the world is watching.\\" He denies any involvement in his neighbor's death but adds that he is not particularly concerned about clearing his name. He is focused on getting his 20-year-old and 17-year-old girlfriends out of Belize and says he has no idea what he'll do next, where he'll live or how he'll support himself.

When Namkhai Norbu Rinpoche escaped Tibet in 1959, he settled in Italy, where he married and had two children, of which Yeshi was the first. Yeshi was recognized as the reincarnation of Rinpoche's uncle, a renowned Dzogchen master, who had died after the Chinese invaded Tibet. Yeshi grew up in Italy and wanted nothing to do with this legacy. He had no interest in being a teacher like his father. Nor did he want to return to Tibet and the monastery of Rinpoche's uncle to meet the students waiting for him since his birth – something that his father continually admonished him to do. Instead, he dreamed of a normal life, away from the hordes of devoted students that always surrounded his father. Through intimate scenes Yeshi is shown growing from 18 years old to 39 years old and maturity, and his father who begins the story in his 50-year-old prime ages to 70 years and his senior years. As the story unravels, what is at stake for Namkhai Norbu Rinpoche is his spiritual tradition, for Yeshi it is his own identity. Will Yeshi's Western lifestyle replace his family tradition and his spiritual roots? Will his father succeed at transplanting the vanishing Tibetan heritage to the Western world? As time moves forward, both father and son begin to change. The image of water and swimming, Namkhai Norbu's beloved pastime, is used as a repetitive thematic pillar through the film as a representation of his teachings of integration and emptiness. The natural sounds of chanting and song, combined with added effects and carefully scored music, is used to express a non-verbal sense of the spiritual world Norbu Rinpoche seeks to transmit to his son, and to the West.

Article: Opposition is growing to the Berlin Zoo's plans to find a new home for Knut, the moneymaking celebrity polar bear whose popularity has been exploited by environmentalists and even Canadian tourism promoters. No longer cute, and just days before his second birthday, Knut will be given a new home that is expected to include a potential mating partner. The Berlin Zoo, facing the global economic crisis, can't afford the estimated  13 million it would take to acquire a female and a new home for them to share. \\"It's time for him to go--the sooner he gets a new home the better,\\" said senior bear keeper Heiner Kloes. But some Berliners are beginning a campaign, collecting petition   signatures and arguing that he's a tourist draw and a symbol as important as the Brandenburg Gate. \\"He means a lot to many people. When you're with him you forget your problems,\\" Hartmut Wiedenroth, co-founder of the campaign, told Spiegel Online. Knut became an international celebrity in 2007, drawing huge crowds to his cage and _ sales of thousands of Knut toys and Knut-shaped candies. The Vancouver-based Canadian Tourism Commission made Knut a major part of its \\"Canada--Keep Exploring\\" campaign to draw tourists to the country-- and especially to polar bear country in northern Manitoba to see them in their natural habitat. Environmentalists also used the bear to promote the fight against global warming. But Knut's popularity diminished as his size increased to 210 kilograms, He was photographed at one point snapping   at a child near his cage. In September his keeper, Thomas Doerflein, died of a heart attack. Doerflein, who became a celebrity himself after nursing the tiny ball of white fur when Knut's mother rejected him, had been re-assigned shortly after Knut's first birthday. Some animal rights critics said Knut has been showing unusually aggressive behavior because of his unnatural upbringing.

Dogs with only DEA 4 or DEA 6 can thus serve as blood donors for the majority of the canine population. Any of these DEA types may stimulate an immune response in a recipient of a blood transfusion, but reactions to DEA 1.1+ are the most severe. Is this statement correct \\"do dogs all have the same blood type\\"?","output":"No, the statement \\"do dogs all have the same blood type\\" is incorrect. Dogs have multiple blood types, and there are over 13 known canine blood groups. Eight Dog Erythrocyte Antigen (DEA) types are recognized as international standards, and these DEA types include DEA 1.1, DEA 1.2, DEA 3, DEA 4, DEA 5, DEA 6, DEA 7, and DEA 8. Each of these blood types has different antigens present on the surface of their red blood cells. Among the various DEA types, DEA 4 and DEA 6 appear on the red blood cells in around 98% of dogs, making them the most prevalent blood types. Dogs with DEA 4 or DEA 6 blood types can serve as blood donors for the majority of the canine population because they are less likely to cause severe immune reactions during blood transfusions. However, it is still essential to match the blood type between the donor and the recipient to minimize the risk of any adverse reaction. One of the critical blood types in dogs is DEA 1.1. Dogs can be either DEA 1.1 positive or negative. The immunological reactions to DEA 1.1 positive blood are the most severe, and thus, it is crucial to avoid transfusing DEA 1.1 positive blood to a DEA 1.1 negative recipient. In conclusion, dogs do not all have the same blood type, and there are multiple blood types recognized in dogs. These different blood types play an essential role in blood transfusions and must be carefully considered to avoid severe immune reactions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Unusual Weather Hits Most of Country A fluctuation in the jet stream unusual for mid-winter has created a wild range of weather. Tornado watches have been issued for parts of Oklahoma, Texas, Kansas, Missouri and Arkansas, and April-like thunderstorms are expected in Chicago. Other states from Texas to Florida, Kansas and parts of the Midwest and Northeast are experiencing record heat. Record warmth is expected today ahead of the storms, with record highs possible in Chicago, St. Louis and Tampa that could reach 60 degrees or more, 73 degrees and 83 degrees, respectively. Additionally, a powerful cold front will slam into the mid-Mississippi Valley today, producing tornadoes and gusty winds near 80 mph. The biggest chance for tornadoes is from Little Rock, Ark., to Memphis, Tenn., but the entire area from Dallas to Houston, New Orleans, Chicago, Indianapolis and St. Louis could see tornadoes and damaging winds. The storms will also create flooding from the Midwest to the Northeast, with some areas getting as much as three inches of rain. The unusual weather will linger through this evening. Areas most at risk for tornadoes include southern Illinois, southwest Indiana, western Kentucky, northern Louisiana, Mississippi, southeast Oklahoma, western Tennessee and northeast Texas, according to NOAA’s Storm Prediction Center. Behind the flooding rain and record warmth, cold air is expected to move in this week. Already in the West, 18 states from Michigan to New Mexico and up to Washington have winter weather warnings and advisories. Blizzard-like conditions might develop on Thursday for places including Des Moines, Iowa; Rochester, Minn.; Eau Clair, Wis., and Green Bay, Wis. These areas will see as much as eight inches of snow, with gusty winds near 35 to 45 mph. The combination could create white-out conditions. The weather will shift dramatically in Chicago by Thursday, dropping from the record high of more than 60 degrees today to 17. Sub-zero wind chill temperatures are likely for most of the Midwest. Along the East Coast, warm air is moving in. Highs will approach 50 degrees today in New York City, with a high of 60 possible Wednesday. Washington, D.C., will approach the mid- to upper-60s Wednesday. The cold air will finally arrive in the Northeast and the East Coast by Friday, blasting the areas with frigid temperatures for the weekend, sweeping in from D.C. to Boston.

Plot title: Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles Movie plot: In modern-day San Francisco, reporter Daniel Molloy (Christian Slater) interviews Louis de Pointe du Lac (Brad Pitt), who claims to be a vampire. Louis begins by describing his human life as a wealthy plantation owner in 1791 Spanish Louisiana. He had lost the will to live following the death of his wife and infant child; one night he is attacked by the vampire Lestat de Lioncourt (Tom Cruise) while drunkenly wandering the waterfront of New Orleans. Lestat senses Louis' dissatisfaction with life and offers to turn him into a vampire. Louis accepts and is transformed, but he rebels against killing humans, drinking animal blood to sustain himself. He is disgusted by Lestat's pleasure in killing and comes to suffer tremendously as a vampire. Louis finally succumbs to his hunger and kills his faithful house slave Yvette (Thandie Newton). Guilt-ridden, he tries to kill himself by setting fire to his house, but Lestat rescues him and they flee. Wandering the streets of New Orleans, amid an outbreak of plague, Louis finds an ill little girl in a house who has not realized her mother is dead. He bites the girl, Claudia (Kirsten Dunst), whom Lestat later transforms into a vampire \\"daughter\\". Lestat hopes that Claudia's transformation will discourage Louis from leaving. As thirty years pass, Claudia matures psychologically but still remains a little girl in appearance. She has become a sadistic killer who closely bonds with Louis. When she finally realizes she will never grow up and have an adult body of her own, thus being trapped in the form of a child forever, she is furious with Lestat and finds herself deeply hating him for making her a vampire. She tricks him into drinking the blood of twin boys she killed by overdosing them with laudanum, knowing that blood from a corpse is fatal to vampires. This weakens him, and she slits his throat. Claudia and Louis dump Lestat's body in a swamp and the two plan a voyage to Europe. However Lestat returns on the night of their departure, having drained the blood of swamp...

Aaron is a little wary of Ethan, who has not been seen since the surrender of the Confederate Army, but his children -- Lucy, Ben and Debbie -- are all overjoyed to see him. So is Martha (Dorothy Jordan), Aaron's wife; she and Ethan clearly are in love though they cannot act on it. Aaron and Martha's adopted quarter Cherokee son Martin arrives for dinner.

He goes to off to bed as do the other kids, and Aaron and Martha soon discover that Ethan is in possession of newly minted Northern money. Aaron agrees to hide the money for Ethan and tells him he is free to stay as long as he likes. Ethan knows his welcome is tenuous, however, and after everyone else goes to bed, sits alone on the porch.The next morning, the Reverend Captain Samuel Clayton (Ward Bond), the area's minister and captain of the Texas Rangers, comes with a posse to the farm. Someone has run off Lars Jorgensen's (John Qualen) cattle. Clayton deputizes Aaron and Martin to join the Rangers' posse. Ethan tells Aaron he is not to go but instead to stay close to home in case the cattle rustling was in fact a diversionary ploy by aggressive Native Americans. Clayton is glad to see his former compatriot in the Confederate Army but also mentions that Ethan matches the description of a lot of wanted criminals. Ethan agrees to go with the Rangers to search for the cattle but refuses to swear an oath to the state of Texas, believing that his oath to the Confederacy is sufficient.They ride off and follow the trail and it isn't long before Marty tries to share his concerns about what they are following with Ethan, but Ethan is...

Pick your answer from:  (A). unacceptable;  (B). acceptable;","output":"(A). unacceptable The sentence provided, \\"The lady singing with a boy is a genius, isn't he?\\" would be considered unacceptable by the strictest standards of a linguist for a couple of reasons. Firstly, the sentence demonstrates a pronoun-antecedent disagreement. The subject of the sentence, \\"the lady,\\" is a feminine noun that requires a corresponding feminine pronoun. However, the pronoun used in the sentence, \\"he,\\" is masculine. The correct pronoun to describe the female subject should be the feminine \\"she.\\" Additionally, the question tag at the end of the sentence should be written as \\"isn't she?\\" to maintain agreement with the gender of the subject. Secondly, the sentence's structure may lead to confusion since \\"singing with a boy\\" is an example of a reduced relative clause. Due to the position of the clause in the sentence, it can be difficult to determine whether it modifies \\"the lady,\\" \\"a genius,\\" or both. While it's likely that the intended meaning is \\"The lady who is singing with a boy is a genius,\\" the ambiguous phrasing leaves room for misinterpretation. Thus, the revised sentence that would be grammatically correct and conform to the standards of a linguist should be: \\"The lady singing with a boy is a genius, isn't she?\\" This revised sentence not only corrects the pronoun-antecedent disagreement but also ensures that the question tag at the end agrees with the gender of the subject."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Why do brittle materials have ultimate tensile strength and not yield strength? What is meant by average and a minimum tensile strength of a material? Multi-choice problem: Would you say that these questions are the same? Select from: [A]. no; [B]. yes;","output":"To answer these questions, let's first understand the key terms and concepts involved: 1. Brittle Materials: These are materials that do not undergo significant deformation or plastic flow before breaking. They fracture at relatively low stress levels and often show no sign of yielding before failure. 2. Ultimate Tensile Strength (UTS): The maximum stress that a material can withstand while being stretched or pulled before breaking. 3. Yield Strength: The stress level at which a material undergoes a permanent deformation, i.e., the material transitions from elastic deformation to plastic deformation. Now, let's address each question step-by-step: Question 1: Why do brittle materials have ultimate tensile strength and not yield strength? Brittle materials have ultimate tensile strength because they do not exhibit significant plastic deformation before breaking. In other words, they do not display a clear yield point, and their elastic behavior ends with failure at the ultimate tensile strength. Since yield strength is used to describe the transition between elastic and plastic deformation, and brittle materials do not undergo plastic deformation, it is not applicable to brittle materials. Question 2: What is meant by average and a minimum tensile strength of a material? Average Tensile Strength: This is the mean value of tensile strength obtained from a series of tests on a material. It represents the strength that is expected on average, considering a large number of samples. Minimum Tensile Strength: This is the lowest value of tensile strength that a material can possess while still being considered to meet specific performance criteria or standards. The minimum tensile strength is important because it ensures the reliability and safety of the material in practical applications. Multi-choice problem: Would you say that these questions are the same? Comparing the questions asked about brittle materials and tensile strength, I would choose the following answer: [A]. no; The questions are not the same, as they address different aspects of material properties and behavior. The first question focuses on understanding why brittle materials have ultimate tensile strength and not yield strength, while the second question deals with the definition and significance of average and minimum tensile strengths."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

But one day, something strange happened: Joanne found herself in a fight with her 58-year-old neighbor, Gary Jones - they were fighting over their bins! That's right, their trash cans! Though Joanne was kind and tried to talk to Gary politely about the problem, Gary decided to be very childish about the situation. Instead of fixing the problem, he pulled silly pranks on Joanne, making her very sad and upset. The battle of the bins got even worse when Gary did something very yucky; he threw half of a cake he had eaten into Joanne's bin! Joanne didn't like that, so she decided to throw the cake back on his doorstep. Gary got very angry, and he did a very bad thing; he went into Joanne's house and attacked her. That's something that no one should ever do. So, what happened after that? Well, the grownups in charge decided that Gary shouldn't be allowed near Joanne and her family for a very long time, specifically three years! They put an order called a ban, and Gary has to follow it, or he might get into even more trouble. And now, Joanne and her family can finally live in peace, knowing that the silly bin battle is over and Gary won't be bothering them any further."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write highlights for this article: He looked delighted when he was presented with a traditional black and white sombrero vueltiao hat during a visit to an organic fair on Wednesday. Now, Prince Charles has two after he was given another while inspecting the treasure at the Museo del Oro Zenu in Cartagena. The Prince, clearly delighted with his duplicate gift, swiftly donned the hat and encouraged the Duchess of Cornwall to do the same with hers - much to the delight of local well-wishers. Sombrero vueltiao hats are made from cane fibre and are a symbol of Colombia, as well as the northern Caribbean region in which the city of Cartagena is located. Scroll down for video. Looking good: Prince Charles was given his second sombrero vueltiao hat of the week during a visit to a museum in Cartagena. Suits you sir: Charles looked delighted with his second hat - and the Duchess of Cornwall appeared to like hers too. Culture: The couple were at the Museo del Oro (Gold Museum) in Cartagena with First Lady María Clemencia Rodríguez de Santos. Popular: Charles got his first hat while visiting an organic food fair at the British Ambassador's residence in Bogota on Tuesday. Originally worn by peasants, the hats have become an enormously popular fashion accessory and are loved by everyone from cowboys to presidents, and now, princes. Charles and Camilla are on the last leg of an eventful four-day visit to the South American country, which has seen the Prince speak of his anguish following the death of his uncle, Lord Mountbatten, as well as a passionate intervention from the Duchess on the subject of sexual violence. This morning, however, most of the drama came from a flamboyantly-dressed dancer who met the couple outside the museum, although the impressive impressive collection of fabulous gold treasures dating from the mediaeval period came a close second. A huge crowd of people, many of whom carried Union flags, had gathered outside the museum to see the couple arrive, with Prince Charles taking the opportunity to share a joke with some of the locals during a walkabout. He also tried his hand at playing the drum and appeared to be enjoying himself, even if those listening were less than enamoured with his musical talents. Following the visit to the museum, the couple continued on to the Naval Academy, where they got an insight into the country's infamous drug problem courtesy of a haul of submarines confiscated from drug gangs and now displayed outside the school. Not sure: At first, Camilla looked a little wary about trying on her black and white sombrero vueltiao hat. This is how you do it: An obliging local man then showed her how to put on and wear the hat. What do you think: The pair then looked to the Prince of Wales to see what he thought of the Duchess' new look. Success! Clearly delighted with Charles' verdict, Camilla beamed for the cameras as María Clemencia Rodríguez de Santos looked on. Afterwards, Charles and Camilla will continue on to a war memorial dedicated to the British soldiers who died during an attempt to take the city's Fort of San Felipe in 1741 before attending the Health of the Oceans conference where the Prince will make a speech. The event, which will also see a speech from Colombia's President Santos, has been organised by the Presidential Co-operation Agency and the Prince's International Sustainability Unit, and will promote sustainability in the development of marine economies. Finally, the couple will wave goodbye to Colombia during a sunset ceremony on board HMS Argyll, a Type 23 'Duke' class frigate, which is currently moored in Cartagena. The tour of Colombia began on Tuesday with a rainy welcome on the tarmac at Bogota airport ahead of a formal welcome - which included taking a salute from a guard of honour - the following day. After an encounter with ballet dancer Fernando Montaño during the state dinner that evening, the royal couple then went on to spend yesterday focusing on the real theme of the tour - promoting peace and combating sexual violence. New talent: The couple were also presented with a traditional drum, which Prince Charles couldn't resist trying out. Not so good: The Prince of Wales burst into laughter following his attempt to play the drum - along with Camilla and Cartagena locals. All smiles: The couple appeared to enjoy their visit to the museum, during which they were shown its collection of gold treasure. Charles also spoke movingly about the loss of his great-uncle Lord Mountbatten, when he visited Bogota's Centre for Peace, Memory and Reconciliation which commemorates those killed and displaced during five decades of violence in the fight against guerillas and drug cartels. In a speech about how he had 'experienced the intense despair caused by the consequences of violence' and stress, he added: 'Many of you will probably not know that my own much-loved great-uncle, Lord Mountbatten, and members of his family ... were murdered in Northern Ireland, just over 30 years ago. 'So I feel I do understand something of the bewildering and soul-destroying anguish that so many of you have had to endure.' Charles was extremely close to his uncle, who died in a terrorist bombing in August 1979. Indeed he viewed the Queen’s second cousin and former Viceroy of India as a second father and mentor. Mountbatten, 79, was assassinated by the Provisional IRA, who planted a bomb in his boat in Co Sligo, in the Irish Republic, during a family fishing trip. One of his twin grandsons, Nicholas Knatchbull, 14, lost his life, along with a local boat boy, 15-year-old Paul Maxwell. Another passenger on the boat, the Dowager Lady Brabourne, 82, died in hospital the day after the attack. Big arrival: The couple arrived in Cartagena, on Colombia's Caribbean coastline, after spending three days in Bogota. Colourful: The couple were met by a flamboyantly dressed traditional dancer outside the Museo del Oro Zenu. Wonderful: Charles and Camilla looked on in delight as the dancer twirled her multicoloured skirts during the dance. Magical: This is the second time the couple have encountered Colombia's flamboyant Caribbean dancers, the first time earlier this week. The only person convicted for the murders, Thomas McMahon, an experienced IRA bomb-maker, was released from jail under the Good Friday peace agreement after serving 18 years in jail. A second man was acquitted. Colombia itself is only just emerging from the longest running civil war in the world which began in 1956 and has so far claimed an estimated 250,000 lives, while displacing more than five million people. Rape and other forms of sexual violence are also widespread, with one woman raped every 15 minutes according to government estimates. The Duchess, who met with a group of brave rape victims, told MailOnline of her admiration for their courage and vowed to speak out and bring the issue of sexual violence 'into the light'. 'I was humbled by the courage of the Colombian women I met today,' she added, 'who had been raped like so many others, in horrendous circumstances, and I salute their determination to bring rape and sexual abuse out of the shadows into the light.' Later, the royal couple went their separate ways with Camilla staying in Bogota and Prince Charles travelling to La Macarena to see Cano Cristales - a river that has been dubbed the liquid rainbow thanks to its propensity for changing colour. Good work: After the dance, the couple congratulated the dancer before meeting a group of excited locals. Nice to meet you: Even more excited was the crowd of locals who had waited outside the museum to see the royal couple. Entertaining: Prince Charles, who was on jolly form, shared a joke with one delighted-looking lady. All together now: The royal couple and Colombia's First Lady also stopped for a glamorous group photo with a group of dancers. The  impressive sight is the result of algae on the riverbed changing its colour at different times of the year, from green and yellow to blue and black and, famously, red. Cano Cristales, south of the capital Bogota and once part of a FARC rebel controlled area, is close to the town of La Macarena and its residents and other groups are attempting to develop a sustainable tourism programme so local people benefit from foreign visitors and the environment is protected. Julia Miranda, director of Colombia's national park service, hosted Charles' visit to the natural wonder and said, after the royal had left, that the visit had been 'marvellous', adding: 'The red colour of the waters was very intense. 'He was really happy to be here and he asked many questions and seemed really interested in the geography of the area.' Charles was also joined during his visit by Colombia's President Juan Manuel Santos who has been instrumental in helping to preserve Colombia's Amazon region. He joked to Charles' entourage that the picturesque spot was known as the FARC country club where a guerrilla general would bring his partner and they would swim in the waters. Before leaving the region Charles visited the quiet settlement and toured a local church built by guerrilla fighters which has a mural painted above the altar showing Jesus with his 12 disciples, who are depicted as Colombian peasants. During the visit, the Prince chatted to members of the local community and looked utterly delighted when one excited little schoolgirl planted a kiss on his cheek. Touching: In La Macarena yesterday, Prince Charles found himself on the receiving end of a kiss from one excited little schoolgirl. Striking: Charles also visited Cano Cristales, a river dubbed 'the liquid rainbow' thanks to its propensity to change colour. Emotional: Charles spoke of his anguish at the loss of his uncle Lord Mountbatten during a speech in Bogota yesterday. Beautiful: Camilla, who was dressed in a pistachio ensemble, spent yesterday afternoon at the Quinta Bolivar museum in Bogota. Important work: The Duchess, who met rape survivors yesterday morning, told MailOnline that she was left 'humbled' by the experience.

Movie title: Green Lantern: First Flight Context: Before any other sentient beings existed in the universe, a race of beings calling themselves the Guardians of the Universe harnessed the power of the green element, the greatest power in the universe, to create the Green Lantern battery. However, the battery was vulnerable to the color yellow, the one part of the light spectrum that could resist green. The Guardians hid the most concentrated source of yellow energy, the yellow element, to prevent others from using it against them. After the death of Abin Sur, several Green Lanterns arrive to take Ferris Aircraft's test pilot Hal Jordan (Christopher Meloni) to the Green Lantern Corps on Oa. He is placed under the supervision of respected senior officer Sinestro (Victor Garber), who is investigating Abin's murder. While undercover on the ship of Kanjar Ro (Kurtwood Smith) searching for the whereabouts of the stolen yellow element, Abin had come under attack. Fleeing to Earth, he had his ring find his successor and died of his injury shortly after. Unbeknownst to the other Green Lanterns, Sinestro had provided Kanjar with the location of the element in order to have it fashioned into a weapon of comparable power to the Green Lantern battery. Jordan quickly comes to understand that Sinestro's beliefs are not in line with those of the Guardians: Sinestro believes that the Guardians have reduced the Corps to merely picking up the messes criminals create as opposed to proactively dealing with the problem. During a mission to capture Kanjar Ro, Jordan is knocked unconscious by Kanjar's energy staff. Sinestro comes in and kills Kanjar, pinning the blame on Jordan. As punishment, the Guardians strip Jordan of his ring. While Jordan waits to be taken home, Sinestro uses his ring to temporarily animate Kanjar's corpse, allowing him to learn the location of Qward where the yellow element weapon is being fashioned. Jordan convinces fellow Lanterns Boodikka (Tricia Helfer) and Kilowog (Michael Madsen) that Sinestro is not what he seems. When they catch Sinestro enacting...

However, the backcountry's untamed wilderness and potential rough conditions have enhanced the risk that these extreme winter athletes face when conquering its mountains. In this thrilling narrative, we will recount the harrowing story of an American professional skier who had a near-death experience when she tumbled down one of these majestic Alaskan mountains. Prelude to the Incident: As preparations reached their peak for the ski season, the athlete decided to push her limits once more, this time embarking on a trip to Alaska. After weeks of intense training with her team, they picked a challenging route on one of the Alaskan mountain ranges, renowned for its technical difficulty and demanding backcountry skiing. Excitement blended with anxiety as the team made their way towards the slopes, unaware of the life-threatening ordeal that awaited them. The Fateful Descent: On the fateful morning, the sky presented the picture-perfect setting for an adrenaline-pumping descent. The crisp Alaskan air invigorated the team as they donned their ski gear and strapped on their helmets, ready for the thrill of a lifetime. As the professional skier descended the treacherous slope, she effortlessly tackled moguls and out-of-bounds chutes at a dizzying speed. Unbeknownst to her, however, the mountain had a formidable challenge brewing ahead. A Lucky Escape: Midway down the slope, the skier encountered an unexpected patch of loose snow that sent her careening off-balance at high speed. In these agonizing seconds, as gravity relentlessly pulled her to the unforgiving ground, the skier found herself in a life-or-death struggle for control. She tumbled helplessly through the air, catching glimpses of the rocks and cliffs below. Her heart raced as she careened closer to the jagged edge, beyond which lay only a freefall into the ravine. It was then that she miraculously found her footing and with all her might, managed to direct her skis away from the edge. But her trials were far from over. In the minutes that followed, she continued her arduous descent, an intense harrowing mix of sliding and stumbling down the icy mountainside. Against all odds, she survived the horrifying ordeal, stopping at the bottom, breathless and battered, yet alive. The Aftermath: The chilling account of her near-death experience served as a potent reminder of the sheer enormity of risks and dangers often faced by professional skiers in the pursuit of their passion. In the aftermath, the athlete made a decision to work diligently on honing her skills in perilous terrains, acknowledging the need for greater awareness and preparation. She expressed her gratitude to her rigorous training and innate self-preservation instincts, which played a huge role in her miraculous escape. Conclusion: Alaska's rugged beauty may captivate the hearts of thrill-seekers around the globe, but as this professional skier's lucky escape proves, these mountainous terrains demand nothing less than the utmost respect, skill, and preparation. Let this extraordinary story serve as a reminder to budding athletes and seasoned professionals alike that the rewards of the backcountry come hand in hand with potential heart-stopping perils, and the mountain will always have the final say."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Abduraheem's family;  (C). not enough information;  (D). The pastor of the church; Given those answer options, answer the question: Six weeks after arriving in the United States, Hassan Abduraheem takes a seat in the back pew of Tar Wallet Baptist Church. Tucked into the woods along a country road in rural Virginia, the church holds about 50 worshippers. On this cold November Sunday, Abduraheem and his family of eight noticeably increase the congregation's size. They do their best to follow the unfamiliar English of the old Baptist hymns, which are very familiar to their new neighbors. And they share the hymns from their former home — Sudan. Standing in a single line in front of the altar, the family fills the church with Arabic song. \\"Unbelievable,\\" Abduraheem says repeatedly, as he describes his journey from a crowded prison cell in Sudan to a fixed-up house on the farm of his new pastor. \\"Unbelievable\\" seems like the only word that could describe the turn his life took, thanks to a Facebook post and a U.S. congressman. Abduraheem's work as a former pastor is not outlawed in his native Sudan, but Christians are a minority in a diverse country that has suffered through multiple civil wars. According to the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom, there has been \\"an escalation in the Sudanese government's persecution of Christians,” since the 2011 secession of South Sudan. Abduraheem says his work was spreading the gospel; the Sudanese government accused him of espionage, and he was detained along with two other pastors in December 2015. \\"The first day when they took us to the prison, they beat us,” he says softly.  Abduraheem was shifted from prison to prison. For five months, he wore the same clothes he was wearing when he was arrested. His eyes became damaged from the harsh prison light.

How do you do this: In order to put shingles on a roof,","output":"Installing shingles on a roof is an essential process for ensuring a durable and weather-resistant roof. Below are the steps to properly put shingles on a roof: 1. Assess and prepare the roof: - Inspect the roof condition to identify any damage, rot, or sagging areas. - Remove existing shingles, underlayment, and other materials, if applicable. - If necessary, repair any damage and ensure the roof structure is solid, level, and ready for the new shingles. 2. Gather necessary tools and materials: - Roofing shingles - Roofing underlayment (usually #15 or #30 felt) - Roofing nails - Hammer - Utility knife - Roofing cement (if needed) - Chalk line - Tape measure - Ladder and/or scaffolding 3. Install the roofing underlayment: - Install the underlayment over the entire roof, starting at the bottom edge and moving upward. This provides a waterproof barrier beneath the shingles. - Overlap each consecutive layer by at least 2 inches to prevent water leakage. - Secure the underlayment with roofing nails. 4. Determine and mark shingle rows: - Measure the length of a shingle and use a chalk line to mark horizontal rows on the underlayment, accordingly. - Mark a vertical chalk line along the center of the roof to guide shingle alignment. 5. Install roofing shingles: - Start laying shingles at the bottom edge of the roof, overlapping the eave (the bottom edge that overhangs the house sidewalls). This ensures water does not penetrate the roof. - Align the first shingle with the vertical chalk line and nail it in place using 4-6 roofing nails per shingle. - Continue laying shingles along the length of the roof, following the horizontal chalk guidelines. - When a row is complete, move up to the next row, aligning the shingle with the lower edge of the underlying row. Be sure to stagger the seams between the shingles in each row to prevent water infiltration. - Trim the excess shingle materials using a utility knife when needed, such as to accommodate vents or roof projections. 6. Install ridge cap shingles: - Cut standard shingles into three equal pieces, creating ridge cap shingles. - Place the first ridge cap shingle on the ridge, making sure it overlaps both sides of the roof. - Work along the ridge, nailing each ridge cap shingle into place, while overlapping the previous one. - The final ridge cap shingle should cover the entire ridge and overlap the previous shingle to ensure proper water shedding. 7. Inspect the roof: - Check the shingles for proper alignment, nailing, and overlaps. - Ensure all vents, flashings, and other projections are covered and sealed correctly. - Look for any debris or leftover materials that need to be removed from the roof. By following this process, you will have successfully installed shingles on a roof, providing a robust, durable, and weather-resistant surface. Remember always to follow safety guidelines while working at heights and to consult professional roofers if any concerns or questions arise throughout the process."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

So what can you do to ensure your fridge---and your food in it---is not a health threat? For starters, clean the fridge weekly---wipe it and repeat. Make sure your fridge is at the correct temperature for storing food, between 0 and 5 degrees centigrade. Your freezer should be below-18 degrees centigrade. You can use fridge and freezer thermeters to make sure this is the case. Some modern fridges have zones to store different types of food ,such as meat and vegetables. Make sure you don\`t store meat in the vegetable zone, as the temperature there might be higher. Make sure you don not leave the door open too long as the temperature in the fridge will quickly rise, creating a breeding  ground for bacteria. Cover food that has not been finished, and eat it within a couple of days. Keep bottles and jars closed. Keep raw meat away from cooked meat. Both should be well covered to prevent pollution. Store raw meat at the bottom of the fridge to stop juices dripping onto other foods. Finally, use common sense, and throw away old food. Question: The purpose of this text is to  _  .

The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who first commissioned the dredging of a canal, and Silver Springs Creek was narrowed between Big Spring and Elixir Spring, which created Big Spring Lake? , can you please find it?   Monte Ne was entirely conceived and funded by William \\"Coin\\" Hope Harvey, a well-known businessman, politician, lecturer and author during the 1890s. Although Harvey was financially successful at silver mining in Colorado, Monte Ne seems to have been funded mostly by the sales of Harvey's writings which dealt with the subject of free silver. His most popular pamphlet, entitled Coin's Financial School, was published in 1893. Sales were buoyed by Harvey's involvement in the 1896 presidential campaign of William Jennings Bryan, and it sold two million copies. Though Bryan lost his bid for President, Harvey had become so important to the campaign that he was made chairman of the Democratic Ways & Means Committee to collect money for the 1900 campaign. However, as a result of an argument before the campaign, he resigned.After Bryan lost his bid for President, Harvey retreated to the Ozark mountains of Northwest Arkansas. In October 1900 he purchased 320 acres (130 ha) of land in Silver Springs (close to present day Rogers) from Reverend Bailey. From that time on he lived in Arkansas, and claimed that he preferred the state because it had no large cities or extremely wealthy people. Leaving his family behind in Chicago, Harvey moved into Reverend Bailey's run-down log house. Harvey's son Tom joined him shortly thereafter to help prepare the house for the rest of the family. They were joined later by Harvey's wife Anna and their children, Annette and Hal. The house burned down a few months after they took up residence, and all of the family's possessions, including Harvey's large library, were lost. Harvey carried no insurance on the house, and after its destruction Anna went back to Chicago, returning to Arkansas only a few times thereafter for brief visits.Harvey's land purchase in Silver Springs coincided with a desire by the local postmaster to change the name of the area, because it was often confused with Siloam Springs, Arkansas. Harvey chose the name Monte Ne, which supposedly combined the Spanish and Omaha...

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis you mentioned, \\"less roots breaking up rocks,\\" seems unrelated to the process of oxygen delivery to the bloodstream. The process you described involves respiration, which is the inhalation of oxygen and the exhalation of carbon dioxide. Plant roots breaking up rocks are part of a geological process, and do not have a direct impact on the oxygen delivery to the human bloodstream. However, an indirect effect could be considered, as plants produce oxygen through photosynthesis. If there is a reduction in the growth of plant roots, this could lead to fewer plants being present overall, potentially decreasing the total oxygen produced in the environment. However, plants produce a relatively small percentage of the global oxygen, with the majority produced by algae and other microorganisms.

Q:I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: Which puppy runs into the forest and needs rescued? ?  One foggy night in Devon, Gail, a working border collie Herding dog, gives birth to a litter of three puppies, cozy in a barn on Borough Farm. As she lies quietly with her newborn litter, her father, Sir Gregory, walks inside, not realizing she had her puppies until she summons his attention and he spots them curled up next to her. She has already named two of them Storm and Drift but she thinks Sir Gregory should name the third. He looks out of the window and names her Mist after the \\"misty\\" night she was born. All the other dogs, Swift, her son Ernie, and Jake, are delighted to meet the puppies at last but Fern doesn't seem to like puppies and is not happy to be their auntie. When the puppies realize they can finally see things, Mist looks out of a nearby window and sees a flock of sheep pass by, but does not exactly know what they are. She points them out to Storm and Drift, but by the time they come to the window, the sheep are gone. They think Mist is making it up, and they playfully tease and wrestle each other around the barn. This soon tires them out, and they slowly fall asleep side by side. Mist seems to like the idea of working the flock more than her brother and sister. Later that day, Sir Gregory talks with Gail about how well Mist is doing compared to Storm and Drift. Gail realises it is finally time to choose which of the puppies will stay on Borough Farm to be trained as a working sheepdog, and which have to leave. One day the puppies are playing in the yard when two different families come to take Storm and Drift away. They are placed in the cars and Gail sadly watches them drive away. Winter arrives at Borough Farm, but Fern has still not warmed up to Mist.

After the war Hong Kong island was ceded to Britain under the Treaty of Nanking and the Chinese market opened to the opium traders of Britain and other nations. The Jardines and Apcar and Company dominated the trade, although P&O also tried to take a share. A Second Opium War fought by Britain and France against China lasted from 1856 until 1860 and led to the Treaty of Tientsin, which legalised the importation of opium. Legalisation stimulated domestic Chinese opium production and increased the importation of opium from Turkey and Persia. This increased competition for the Chinese market led to India reducing its opium output and diversifying its exports.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Here is a question about this article: Due to its location at the South Pole, Antarctica receives relatively little solar radiation. This means that it is a very cold continent where water is mostly in the form of ice. Precipitation is low (most of Antarctica is a desert) and almost always in the form of snow, which accumulates and forms a giant ice sheet which covers the land. Parts of this ice sheet form moving glaciers known as ice streams, which flow towards the edges of the continent. Next to the continental shore are many ice shelves. These are floating extensions of outflowing glaciers from the continental ice mass. Offshore, temperatures are also low enough that ice is formed from seawater through most of the year. It is important to understand the various types of Antarctic ice to understand possible effects on sea levels and the implications of global cooling. What is the answer to this question: What location means that Antarctica get little solar radiation?","output":"Antarctica's location at the South Pole is the primary reason it receives relatively little solar radiation. Being situated at the Earth's southernmost point, the continent experiences extreme tilt and long periods of darkness during the winter months. During the summer, although sunlight is available for longer durations, the angle at which the sun's rays strike the Earth's surface is still oblique. This results in a significant reduction in the intensity of solar radiation absorbed by the continent, leading to its extremely cold temperature, largely frozen water, and overall frigid environment. Consequently, understanding the diverse types of Antarctic ice is crucial to assess potential impacts on sea levels and the broader implications of global cooling."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Information:  - Digimon World DS , known in Japan as Digimon Story (  Dejimon Sutr ) , is a role - playing video game and the first Digimon game for the Nintendo DS. It is not part of the Digimon World series , as suggested by its localized title , but the game does bears a resemblance to Digimon World 3 . In the game , the player assumes the role of a Digimon tamer and embarks on a journey to discover , tame , raise , train and command more than 230 unique Digimon . The player can build Digi - Farms to raise , evolve and communicate with the Digimon .

Many role-playing video games have origins in pen-and-paper role-playing games (Including \\"Dungeons & Dragons\\") and use much of the same , settings and game mechanics. Other major similarities with pen-and-paper games include developed story-telling and narrative elements, player character development, complexity, as well as replayability and immersion. The electronic medium removes the necessity for a gamemaster and increases combat resolution speed. RPGs have evolved from simple text-based console-window games into visually rich 3D experiences. Since the 1980s, Role-playing is the most commercially viable video game genre in Japan, and has more market share of any other genre in the japanese gaming industry, although in the 2010s first-person shooters and western iOS and Android games were becoming rapidly and increasingly popular in that country.  - Sony Corporation is the electronics business unit and the parent company of the Sony Group, which is engaged in business through its four operating components  electronics (video games, network services and medical business), motion pictures, music and financial services.

Answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the name of the foundation that donated to complete construction work at the college?  The Second World War meant that construction work on the main college buildings could not begin until 21 April 1949, when the foundation stone was laid; work on the warden's residence had begun in October 1948. Before the buildings were erected, the college operated from rented houses elsewhere in Oxford, on Banbury Road and Woodstock Road. There were further changes to Harrison's second design, as not only had inflation between 1937 and 1949 reduced the value of Nuffield's original donation, but additional savings had to be made in the difficult post-war economic situation. A scale model, created in 1949 as work started, showed the alterations: a shortened tower, a plainer main entrance, and no arcades within the quadrangles. Further changes were made once work was under way, including the indefinite postponement of construction of the institute opposite the college. The plans of the tower were altered so that it would hold a library, instead of being purely ornamental, windows were added at regular intervals, and it was topped by a copper flèche, or small spire.A further delay in construction was announced in 1951, when labour and materials were restricted because of a government rearmament drive. Work to complete the quadrangle, including a hall, kitchen and the library tower, began in 1955 at a cost of £200,000. This money was donated to the college by the Nuffield Foundation upon Lord Nuffield's recommendation. Until it was required for books, the fellows of the college used the upper floor as a Senior Common Room. The tower was completed in 1956, and the college as a whole (without the institute on the site opposite, which is now used as a car park) was finished in 1960. Work was still under way when the college was incorporated by royal charter in 1958, thereby becoming a self-governing entity. The charter was presented to the college by the Duke of Edinburgh on 6 June 1958, at the first lunch to be served in the hall.Colvin commented that, apart from the flèche which was similar to the initial plan,...

Thomas Edward Lawrence was born on 16 August 1888 in Tremadog, Carnarvonshire (now Gwynedd), Wales in a house named Gorphwysfa, now known as Snowdon Lodge. His Anglo-Irish father Thomas Chapman had left his wife Edith after he fell in love and had a son with Sarah Junner, a young Scotswoman who had been engaged as governess to his daughters. Sarah was the daughter of Elizabeth Junner and John Lawrence, who worked as a ship's carpenter and was a son of the household in which Elizabeth had been a servant. She was dismissed four months before Sarah was born. The chief elements of the Arab strategy, developed chiefly by Faisal and Lawrence, were firstly to avoid capturing Medina, and secondly to extend northwards through Maan and Deraa to Damascus and beyond. The Emir Faisal wanted to lead regular attacks against the Ottomans, which Lawrence persuaded him to drop. Lawrence wrote about the Bedouin as a fighting force:  \\"The value of the tribes is defensive only and their real sphere is guerilla warfare. They are intelligent, and very lively, almost reckless, but too individualistic to endure commands, or fight in line, or to help each other. It would, I think, be possible to make an organized force out of them...The Hejaz war is one of dervishes against regular forces-and we are on the side of the dervishes. Our text-books do not apply to its conditions at all\\".  Medina was an attractive target for the revolt as Islam's second-holiest site, and because its Ottoman garrison was weakened by disease and isolation. It became clear that it was advantageous to leave it there rather than try to capture it, while continually attacking, but not permanently breaking, the Hejaz railway south from Damascus. This prevented the Ottomans from making effective use of their troops at Medina, and forced them to dedicate many resources to defending and repairing the railway line.  The movement north to Damascus and eventually Aleppo is interesting in the context of the Sykes-Picot agreement. While it is not known when Lawrence learned the details of Sykes-Picot, nor if or when he briefed Faisal on what he knew, there is good reason to think that both these things happened, and earlier rather than later. In particular, the Arab strategy of northward extension makes perfect sense given the Sykes-Picot language that spoke of an independent Arab entity in Syria, which would only be granted if the Arabs liberated the territory themselves. The French, and some of their British Liaison officers, were specifically uncomfortable about the northward movement, as it would weaken French colonial claims. Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Why did their enemies want to capture Medina?","output":"As mentioned in the text provided: \\"Medina was an attractive target for the revolt as Islam's second-holiest site, and because its Ottoman garrison was weakened by disease and isolation.\\" The enemies, in this case, the Arab forces, wanted to capture Medina due to its religious significance and the vulnerable state of the Ottoman garrison defending it."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Place the tooth under your pillow: Before going to bed, place the wrapped or contained tooth underneath your pillow. This is the traditional spot where children leave their lost teeth for the tooth fairy. 5. Write a note (optional): To make this experience even more personal and memorable, you can write a short note or letter to the tooth fairy, expressing your gratitude for their visit and asking any questions you might have. Place this note next to the tooth under your pillow. 6. Go to sleep: Now that you have completed all the necessary preparations, it's time to go to bed! Close your eyes, relax, and fall asleep, knowing that the tooth fairy will visit while you rest. 7. Tooth fairy's visit: While you are asleep, the tooth fairy will visit your room to collect your lost tooth from under your pillow. In exchange for your tooth, the tooth fairy typically leaves a small gift or money for you to discover when you wake up. 8. Wake up and check: When you wake up the following morning, don't forget to check under your pillow for the gift or money left by the tooth fairy. Share your exciting discovery with your family and celebrate this unique ritual of childhood. In conclusion, to get the tooth fairy to come after losing a tooth, placing the lost tooth underneath your pillow before you go to bed is the most effective and widely accepted method. By following the steps mentioned above, you can ensure a memorable and magical experience for yourself or your child while keeping this age-old tradition alive."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The premise explicitly states that \\"Of the Italian paintings, Bellini's L'Ivresse de Noè (The Drunkenness of Noah) and Giordano's Philosophe Cynique are outstanding.\\" This statement indicates that both Bellini's L'Ivresse de Noè (The Drunkenness of Noah) and Giordano's Philosophe Cynique are indeed Italian paintings, as they are being described as outstanding examples within the context of Italian artwork. To further analyze the hypothesis and premise, let us examine the artists and their paintings individually. 1. Bellini's L'Ivresse de Noè (The Drunkenness of Noah) Giovanni Bellini (circa 1430-1516) was a prominent Venetian painter during the Renaissance era in Italy. He is known for his contributions to the Venetian school of painting, which emphasized the use of color and atmosphere in tandem with the general concepts of the Italian Renaissance. L'Ivresse de Noè, or The Drunkenness of Noah, is a painting by Bellini that depicts the biblical story of Noah becoming drunk after the flood and his subsequent humiliation. According to the premise, this painting is considered an outstanding example of an Italian painting, which directly contradicts the hypothesis suggesting that it is not an Italian painting. 2. Giordano's Philosophe Cynique Luca Giordano (1634-1705) was an Italian painter and printmaker who worked in a late Baroque style. Born in Naples, he is known for his prolific and diverse artistic output that includes frescoes, altarpieces, and easel paintings. Philosophe Cynique is one of Giordano's works, showcasing his talent for painting, and is explicitly mentioned as an outstanding Italian painting within the premise. In conclusion, the hypothesis \\"The Drunkenness of Noah is not an Italian painting\\" is false when considered in relation to the given premise. Both Bellini's L'Ivresse de Noè (The Drunkenness of Noah) and Giordano's Philosophe Cynique are noted as outstanding examples of Italian paintings, confirming their status as works of Italian art."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Time and time again, it seems that the comedic actors of Hollywood are surprising me with their talents as dramatic performers: first it was Robin Williams {'One Hour Photo (2002)'}, then it was Jim Carrey {'Eternal Sunshine (2004)' being one example}, then Will Ferrell {'Stranger than Fiction (2006)'} and now Adam Sandler. Yes, that's absolutely right: the guy who has based an entire career on making brainless, goofball comedies {I'm not complaining; I've always been a fan} has finally given me a performance of which he can be proud. Of course, some readers may be wondering whatever happened to 'Punch-Drunk Love (2002),' but I can only assure you that it's a film I'm currently taking measures to see as soon as possible, since I've heard it's terrific. My first film from director Mike Binder, 'Reign Over Me,' is an intelligent and respectful exploration of grief and friendship. Though it does occasionally stray into all-too-familiar territory, the somewhat predictable storyline proves surprisingly deep and moving, with both Sandler and Don Cheadle giving memorable performances. Alan Johnson (Cheadle) is a successful dentist with a good family, though he finds himself unable to communicate adequately with his wife (Jada Pinkett Smith) and so his marriage is a little shaky. Charlie Fineman (Adam Sandler) is Alan's ex-college roommate, a man who lost his entire family in the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and who is still confronting his overwhelming feelings of grief. A disheveled figure with messy hair and downcast eyes {often likened in appearance to Bob Dylan}, Charlie has abandoned his career in dentistry, and spends his time in solitude: listening to music with headphones that cut out all sound from the outside world, driving around Manhattan in his motorised scooter, immersing himself in fantastical video games and repeatedly redecorating his apartment kitchen in accordance with his deceased wife's final wishes. When Alan and Charlie meet for the first time in years, the latter doesn't even recognise an old friend, having completely abandoned any memories prior to his life-crippling experience. Indeed, at first he doesn't even acknowledge the existence of his family, and abruptly loses his temper whenever anybody suggests that he seek counselling. Initially, it may seem a bit exploitative for the filmmakers to be using the September 11 attacks as a storytelling device. Afterall, wouldn't it be just as devastating if Charlie's family had died in an ordinary, everyday car accident? However, if you consider that the director's intention was to demonstrate the enormous pain caused to ordinary citizens by the tragedy, then 'Reign Over Me' does a very good job. It's easy to get so caught up in meaningless statistics that you neglect the emotional costs of the terrorist attacks; this is the first 9/11-orientated film I've seen that truly dealt with the suffering of those who weren't even involved, whose only anguish was caused through losing those whom they loved. Adam Sandler shows surprising range in a difficult role, one which would have crumbled to pieces had he not been up to the task. Snapping instantly between cheerfulness, anger and depression, Charlie Fineman is a man with whom we can deeply sympathise, a hollow soul who, thanks to the companionship of an old friend, can finally glimpse light at the end of a dark, bleak tunnel. What is the sentiment of this review?","output":"The sentiment of this review is primarily positive. It appreciates the film 'Reign Over Me' for its intelligent and respectful exploration of grief and friendship, highlighting the impressive performances by Adam Sandler and Don Cheadle. While acknowledging that the story occasionally strays into familiar territory and could be viewed as potentially exploitative regarding the September 11 attacks, the reviewer believes the film effectively portrays the emotional cost of the tragedy to ordinary citizens.

Now, even art museums and galleries  are collecting the works of street artists. People have different thoughts about street art. Some think street art is bad, but others see this art as a rich form of non-traditional cultural expression. Street art began in New York City in the 1960s. Young adults would use paint in special cans to spray  their \\"tag\\" on walls and train cars around the city. This tag was a name they created to show off themselves and their artwork. This style of drawing and writing became known as graffiti . Graffiti art showed that young people wanted to rebel  against the rules.

Jeffrey was being helped by Dennis through the grieving process for","output":"his beloved dog, Sparky. After ten wonderful years together, Sparky's passing had left an unfillable void in Jeffrey's life. Dennis, being his childhood best friend and a grief counselor, insisted on helping Jeffrey to cope with his pain. Step 1: Identify emotions and accept the feeling of loss Dennis began by encouraging Jeffrey to express his emotions openly. \\"It's normal to feel sad, angry, or even guilty when losing a loved one,\\" Dennis reassured him. By discussing these feelings and accepting the emotional pain, Jeffrey would be able to begin moving through the grieving process.  Step 2: Share memories through storytelling Dennis knew that retelling stories and recalling shared memories could bring comfort during difficult times. He encouraged Jeffrey to spend time reminiscing about the adventures he and Sparky had experienced together. This storytelling allowed Jeffrey to relive and cherish the special bond he had with Sparky while giving him an opportunity to truly celebrate his dog's life. Step 3: Create a memorial Dennis suggested that creating a memorial for Sparky could help immensely with the grieving process. Whether it was a photo album, a special spot in the garden, or a piece of art, having a memorial would give Jeffrey a regular reminder of the love they shared and the timeless connection between them. Jeffrey decided to create a small corner in his living room dedicated to Sparky, where he placed photographs, Sparky's favorite toys, and heartfelt letters expressing his love and gratitude for their time together. Step 4: Join a support group Knowing that others were going through similar experiences, Dennis encouraged Jeffrey to attend a pet loss support group in their community. This group allowed Jeffrey to connect with other grieving pet owners, opening a safe space for sharing emotions, stories, and coping strategies. The support and guidance from fellow pet lovers helped Jeffrey feel understood and less isolated as he learned to deal with his grief. Step 5: Allow time to heal Dennis reminded Jeffrey not to rush through his grieving process. Healing and acceptance take time, and everyone grieves at their own pace. Instead of forcing himself to move on, Jeffrey needed to give himself ample time and space to process his emotions and find a new sense of normalcy. Step 6: Explore new ways to channel feelings As Jeffrey began to heal, Dennis urged him to find new ways to channel his feelings of love and compassion for Sparky. One option was to volunteer at a local animal shelter, dedicating time and energy to helping animals in need. By giving back in Sparky's memory, Jeffrey could honor his beloved companion while finding solace and purpose in a new endeavor. Over the next few months, Jeffrey diligently worked through each of these steps under Dennis's guidance. Gradually, he came to terms with his loss and was able to remember Sparky with more joy than sorrow. While his love for Sparky would never fade, Jeffrey began to understand that it was possible to move forward and cherish the memories they had shared."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Background: Law enforcement officers are often unfamiliar with information technology, and so lack the skills and interest in pursuing attackers. There are also budgetary constraints. It has been argued that the high cost of technology, such as DNA testing, and improved forensics mean less money for other kinds of law enforcement, so the overall rate of criminals not getting dealt with goes up as the cost of the technology increases. In addition, the identification of attackers across a network may require logs from various points in the network and in many countries, the release of these records to law enforcement (with the exception of being voluntarily surrendered by a network administrator or a system administrator) requires a search warrant and, depending on the circumstances, the legal proceedings required can be drawn out to the point where the records are either regularly destroyed, or the information is no longer relevant.

Which pack had more difficulty targeting prey animals?  Two packs of lions were hunting large herbivores.  The Simba pack was ambushing wounded individual prey animals, while the Mobutu pack followed large groups of zebras and other grazers.  Hint: Individuals living in large groups may be safer from attack because the predator may be confused by the large group size. As the group moves, the predator has greater difficulty targeting an individual prey animal. The zebra has been suggested by the zoologist Martin Stevens and his colleagues as an example of this. When stationary, a single zebra stands out because of its large size. To reduce the risk of attack, zebras often travel in herds. The striped patterns of all the zebras in the herd may confuse the predator, making it harder for the predator to focus in on an individual zebra. Furthermore, when moving rapidly, the zebra stripes create a confusing, flickering motion dazzle effect in the eye of the predator.

Context: SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear agreement is not expected to derail diplomatic momentum to reach a deal to end North Korea’s nuclear weapons program, but it could complicate the negotiation process, analysts say. Trump on Tuesday announced that the United States is ending its participation in the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) that lifted sanctions on Iran in exchange for Tehran limiting its nuclear program, and would re-impose U.S. economic sanctions on Iran. The agreement was negotiated by the administration of Trump’s predecessor, President Barack Obama, and involved five other world powers; Great Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia. Trump’s National Security Adviser John Bolton said the U.S. decision to re-impose sanctions on Iran will set a higher standard for North Korea nuclear talks by sending, “a very clear signal that the United States will not accept inadequate deals.” The U.S. policy reversal on Iran should not seriously impede diplomatic progress underway with North Korea, said Victor Cha, a noted Korea scholar with the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “In terms of how the North Koreans would take it, I don’t think they’d take it one way or the other. I don’t think they’d see it as negative or positive because they think they’re different from anybody else anyway. They think they’re a very special case,” Cha said at a CSIS conference this week. While the Iran deal limited that country’s efforts to develop a nuclear bomb, North Korea already possesses 20 to 60 nuclear warheads, according assessments by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency, and between 40 to 100 nuclear development facilities, according a report from the RAND Corporation security research organization.

Information:  - The Roman Empire (Koine and Medieval Greek:   , tr. ) was the post-Roman Republic period of the ancient Roman civilization, characterized by government headed by emperors and large territorial holdings around the Mediterranean Sea in Europe, Africa and Asia. The city of Rome was the largest city in the world BC AD, with Constantinople (New Rome) becoming the largest around 500 AD, and the Empire's populace grew to an estimated 50 to 90 million inhabitants (roughly 20% of the world's population at the time). The 500-year-old republic which preceded it was severely destabilized in a series of civil wars and political conflict, during which Julius Caesar was appointed as perpetual dictator and then assassinated in 44 BC. Civil wars and executions continued, culminating in the victory of Octavian, Caesar's adopted son, over Mark Antony and Cleopatra at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC and the annexation of Egypt. Octavian's power was then unassailable and in 27 BC the Roman Senate formally granted him overarching power and the new title \\"Augustus\\", effectively marking the end of the Roman Republic.  - Gaius Julius Caesar (13 July 100 BC  15 March 44 BC), known as Julius Caesar, was a Roman politician, general, and notable author of Latin prose. He played a critical role in the events that led to the demise of the Roman Republic and the rise of the Roman Empire.  - Opera (English plural: \\"operas\\"; Italian plural: \\"opere\\" ) is an art form in which singers and musicians perform a dramatic work combining text (libretto) and musical score, usually in a theatrical setting. In traditional opera, singers do two types of singing: recitative, a speech-inflected style and arias, a more melodic style. Opera incorporates many of the elements of spoken theatre, such as acting, scenery, and costumes and sometimes includes dance.

The history of European comics is often traced to Rodolphe Töpffer's cartoon strips of the 1830s, and became popular following the success in the 1930s of strips and books such as \\"The Adventures of Tintin\\". American comics emerged as a mass medium in the early 20th century with the advent of newspaper comic strips; magazine-style comic books followed in the 1930s, in which the superhero genre became prominent after Superman appeared in 1938. Histories of Japanese comics and cartooning (\\"\\") propose origins as early as the 12th century.

Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. A:","output":"No, the provided answer is not directly answering the question about where translation on DNA happens. The answer explains the difference between prokaryotic and eukaryotic ribosomes and their significance concerning antibiotic function. However, it does not specify where the translation process occurs.  To correctly answer the question, \\"Where does translation on DNA happen?\\":  Translation is the process of synthesizing proteins from the information encoded in the messenger RNA (mRNA), which is transcribed from DNA. This process occurs in cellular structures called ribosomes. In both prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells, translation takes place in the cytoplasm, where ribosomes are present.  In prokaryotic cells (e.g., bacteria), translation starts while the mRNA is still being transcribed because prokaryotes lack a membrane-bound nucleus and their genetic material floats freely in the cytoplasm. This means that transcription and translation processes can occur simultaneously. In eukaryotic cells (e.g., plants, animals), transcription occurs in the nucleus, where DNA is located. After transcription, the mRNA is processed and transported out of the nucleus and into the cytoplasm. Once in the cytoplasm, the mRNA associates with ribosomes, and the translation process begins. In summary, the correct answer to the question is that translation on DNA happens in the cytoplasm of the cell. Although prokaryotic and eukaryotic ribosomes differ in structure, the location of translation within the cell remains the same."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

His fellow officer, Rafael Ramos, was killed alongside Liu by a man who had previously posted online content expressing anti-police sentiments. Liu had been married for less than three months when his life was violently cut short. His wife, Sanny Liu, however, ensured that her husband's legacy would live on by making a special request on the night of his death. Through a remarkable combination of love, determination, and scientific advancement, Officer Liu became a father more than two years after his death, as Sanny gave birth to their healthy baby girl, Angelina, in New York City. In an unprecedented turn of events, sperm from the fallen officer was retrieved and frozen on the very night of his death, following the request made by his grieving widow. With the help of in-vitro fertilization (IVF), Sanny Liu gave birth to her daughter Angelina on a Tuesday, as reported by ABC 7. This remarkable achievement demonstrates the incredible advances made in modern medicine and the power of love to overcome even the most tragic of circumstances. Maria Dziergowski, a close friend, shared that Liu's parents had arrived at the hospital within hours of the birth to meet their new granddaughter. The grandparents were tearful and emotional as they held Angelina in their arms. \\"The parents were very emotional, crying and holding the baby,\\" she told the New York Post. According to NBC New York, Sanny Liu recalled a dream she had the night after her husband was killed in his patrol car, in which he appeared to her, handing her a baby girl. Buoyed by this vivid experience, Sanny remained convinced throughout her pregnancy that she would be giving birth to a daughter. \\"I told my friend, 'It's going to be a baby girl.'

Furthermore, Mrs. Liu intends to introduce little Angelina to the NYPD, her \\"big blue family.\\" Members of the NYPD had shown solidarity and sorrow for their fallen comrade at his funeral, where many officers turned their backs on Mayor Bill de Blasio in a powerful expression of unity amidst heartbreak.

I was victimised by a gang of bent police men, who arrested me and set me up to get charged with something that I did not do which I believe was connected to other criminals who live in my area, who I believe were connected to a gang of DJ’s who were involved stealing intellectual and copyright works from me (likely their party organisers and drug dealer buddies). I was sent to court and found guilty based on no evidence by a magistrate court judge who was later struck off for corruption after defrauding an old lady of over a million pounds! I was not put in prison for this minor offense but did receive a minor criminal record. This criminal records the same DJ’s and bent ex-police have used to ruin my reputation and career. One of the bent policemen, who incidentally had already been thrown out of the police force for car insurance fraud, even turned up at the uni I went to and spread vicious slander to ruin me there, and in the area that I lived at the time. I was then victimised by the people at the famous college that I went to and all my intellectual and copyright works stolen. Which I note, generated millions for others. Once they made their money and gained credibility on the back of my hard work, innovation and some may say genius, the thieves then did all they could to ruin my reputation in the entertainment industry and in the area that I live.

When we combine them, we get: -28d + 19d = -9d (because -28 + 19 = -9) Now the equation is: 0 = -9d + 72 Step 2: Isolate the variable 'd' To find the value of 'd', we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. In our case, we need to move the 72 to the other side of the equation. To do this, subtract 72 from both sides of the equation: 0 - 72 = -9d + 72 - 72 Which simplifies to: -72 = -9d Step 3: Solve for 'd' Now, we just have to solve for 'd' by dividing both sides of the equation by -9: -72 / -9 = -9d / -9 Which simplifies to: 8 = d So, the value of 'd' that satisfies the equation 0 = -28d + 19d + 72 is d = 8."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: This article: The traditions of the local peoples are unanimous in affirming that the oldest inhabitants of Casamance are the Bainuk people and that the left bank of the mouth of the river was first populated by the Jola. Portuguese sailors reached the west African coast in the 15th century, and in the 16th century, Portuguese traders became active in the Casamance region, mostly in search of wax, ivory, and slaves. They did not linger on \\"Mosquito Island\\", instead founding their first trading post at Ziguinchor in 1645.In the late 1820s, a mulatto trader from Gorée, Pierre Baudin, moved to Itou and began planting rice and producing lime by crushing the shells of mangrove oysters and cooking them in lime kilns. The French administration treated Baudin as their representative on the island and did not send others because few of the French wanted to live on the island. Being wet and marshy, Carabane had a reputation for its poor sanitation. The local economy was based mainly on weedy rice, which was sold in Ziguinchor or to the British in The Gambia. The Baudin family used slaves to produce the rice and, despite the declaration of its official abolition in the French colonial empire in 1848, slavery continued on the island until the early 20th century.The colonial administration wanted to expand its influence around the river, particularly because the inhabitants of Gorée were threatened with losing part of their resources with the imminent demise of the slave trade, and also because of their competition with Saint-Louis. On January 9, 1836, Lieutenant Malavois, who was in charge of Gorée, left for Casamance in search of a site for a trading post. The tip of Diogue, on the north shore, was first considered, but at the refusal of the Jola, it was the opposite bank which was eventually accepted. contains an answer for the question: What was the name of the person was in charge of Gorée?, what is it ?

Read this and answer the question The early Manchu rulers also established two foundations of legitimacy which help to explain the stability of their dynasty. The first was the bureaucratic institutions and the neo-Confucian culture which they adopted from earlier dynasties. Manchu rulers and Han Chinese scholar-official elites gradually came to terms with each other. The examination system offered a path for ethnic Han to become officials. Imperial patronage of Kangxi Dictionary demonstrated respect for Confucian learning, while the Sacred Edict of 1670 effectively extolled Confucian family values. The second major source of stability was the Central Asian aspect of their Manchu identity which allowed them to appeal to Mongol, Tibetan and Uighur constituents. The Qing used the title of Emperor (Huangdi) in Chinese while among Mongols the Qing monarch was referred to as Bogda khan (wise Khan), and referred to as Gong Ma in Tibet. Qianlong propagated the image of himself as Buddhist sage rulers, patrons of Tibetan Buddhism. In the Manchu language, the Qing monarch was alternately referred to as either Huwangdi (Emperor) or Khan with no special distinction between the two usages. The Kangxi Emperor also welcomed to his court Jesuit missionaries, who had first come to China under the Ming. Missionaries including Tomás Pereira, Martino Martini, Johann Adam Schall von Bell, Ferdinand Verbiest and Antoine Thomas held significant positions as military weapons experts, mathematicians, cartographers, astronomers and advisers to the emperor.

Do these sentences mean the same thing? OPT: (1). no; (2). yes;","output":"Option (1). No, the two sentences do not mean the same thing. In the first sentence, it states that a council of several American Indian tribes from the Detroit region listened to a speech from the Ottawa leader Pontiac. This implies that the council was held in the Detroit region, and the leader giving the speech was an Ottawa tribe leader named Pontiac. In contrast, the second sentence says that a council of several Indian tribes from the Ottawa region heard a speech from the Detroit leader Pontiac. This suggests that the council took place in the Ottawa region and that the leader giving the speech, Pontiac, was a leader from the Detroit region. The key difference lies in the origin of the Indian tribes and the leader Pontiac. The first sentence places the tribes in the Detroit region and Pontiac as an Ottawa leader, while the second sentence positions the tribes in the Ottawa region and Pontiac as a Detroit leader.

In a microbial culture, a growth medium is provided for a specific agent. A sample taken from potentially diseased tissue or fluid is then tested for the presence of an infectious agent able to grow within that medium. Most pathogenic bacteria are easily grown on nutrient agar, a form of solid medium that supplies carbohydrates and proteins necessary for growth of a bacterium, along with copious amounts of water. A single bacterium will grow into a visible mound on the surface of the plate called a colony, which may be separated from other colonies or melded together into a \\"lawn\\". The size, color, shape and form of a colony is characteristic of the bacterial species, its specific genetic makeup (its strain), and the environment that supports its growth. Other ingredients are often added to the plate to aid in identification. Plates may contain substances that permit the growth of some bacteria and not others, or that change color in response to certain bacteria and not others. Bacteriological plates such as these are commonly used in the clinical identification of infectious bacterium. Microbial culture may also be used in the identification of viruses: the medium in this case being cells grown in culture that the virus can infect, and then alter or kill. In the case of viral identification, a region of dead cells results from viral growth, and is called a \\"plaque\\".

Here's why: In the context, it says Christine Jones was born in either 1964 or 1965. If we imagine we are in the year 2014, we can find out how old she is: If she was born in 1964: 2014 (the year we are imagining) minus 1964 (the year she might have been born) equals 50 years old. If she was born in 1965: 2014 (the year we are imagining) minus 1965 (the year she might have been born) equals 49 years old. From the context, Christine Jones would be either 49 or 50 years old in 2014, not 14 years old."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Shelby has problems with the bank about the bowling alley she inherited when her mother died and still believes that she and Mike are still an item. After the football game Mike and Elizabeth decide to go to Shelby's bowling alley. When Shelby sees Mike she kisses him, but Mike tells her that he has a new girlfriend. Shelby befriends Elizabeth and after a few tequila shots, a drunk Elizabeth says she is going to meet Mike's parents after. Shelby then tells her that Mike's parents are over judgmental, making Elizabeth nervous. Wanting to give a good first impression to Mike's parents, Elizabeth decides to go to a motel and sleep her intoxication off, so gets driven to the nearest one from Mike's policeman cousin Billy. As she arrives at check-in, the man behind the counter tells her that there are not any rooms left because of the homecoming football games and the nearest motel is four miles away. Mike goes home to see his mother, who tells him that one of her friends said his new girlfriend got drunk at the alley.

Premise: \\"yeah i could i could probably go half a pound\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"Possibly I could go half a pound.\\" true?","output":"Based on the given premise, \\"yeah I could I could probably go half a pound,\\" it is reasonable to infer that the hypothesis \\"Possibly I could go half a pound\\" is true. Let's break down why this conclusion can be made. Initially, we need to understand the meaning of both the premise and hypothesis statements. Premise: \\"yeah I could I could probably go half a pound.\\" This statement has a sense of affirmation given by the word \\"yeah,\\" and a measure of probability is indicated by the term \\"probably.\\" The speaker is stating that they are confident in their ability to take on half a pound, although they do not guarantee it with absolute certainty. The repetition of the phrase \\"I could\\" adds a slight emphasis to their confidence. Hypothesis: \\"Possibly I could go half a pound.\\" The word \\"possibly\\" adds a layer of uncertainty to the statement, implying that the speaker believes there is a chance they could handle half a pound. It is important to note that the hypothesis isn't refuting the possibility of going half a pound, but rather it accepts the potential for that outcome without asserting it as a certainty. When comparing the two statements, we find some common ground in both. They both reflect the speaker's potential to handle half a pound. The premise provides more confidence in the ability to achieve this, while the hypothesis provides a more cautious, uncertain approach.  Considering these parallel themes and their overlapping nature, it is plausible to conclude that the hypothesis \\"Possibly I could go half a pound\\" is true when taking into account the premise \\"yeah I could I could probably go half a pound.\\" The statements are not contradictory, and the hypothesis aligns with the premise in terms of the mentioned possibility."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

View, Interrupted: The Spoiling of Manhattan’s Skyline MANHATTAN is an island of serious wealth, endless ambition and impossibly expensive real estate. It is also an actual island, which means that some people are priced out for a variety of reasons and leave at the end of the day. That would include me. That means a bridge, a tunnel or a helicopter. (Then again, if you have enough money for a chopper, you can probably live where you like.) In my case, I live in northern New Jersey and commute through the Lincoln Tunnel, either by bus or by car, traveling on the so-called helix. When it is not under construction, which is frequently, the helix is an engineering marvel, a nearly circular switchback straight out of the roller-coaster school of architecture that allows cars and buses to descend from the bluffs above to the shoreline below, and reverse in ascent. There are a lot of us at the Lincoln Tunnel: Every weekday, over 100,000 cars, buses and trucks pay a significant toll in time and treasure to gain access from New Jersey to Manhattan, and then line up to flee at the end of the night. Two apartment buildings under construction in Weehawken, N.J., steal a momentary pleasure once afforded to commuters. Credit By David Carr and Robin Lindsay on Publish Date May 31, 2014 Credit Suzanne DeChillo/The New York Times It can be brutal. After a day of fighting for a place to stand on the island to get business done amid a thicket of self-important people in a hurry, we are again back in the queue, waiting our turn. But halfway up the helix, the city we just left roars into view in side profile. Big on top (Midtown), thinner in the middle (Chelsea and Greenwich Village) and big on the bottom (Downtown), the city is irresistible, a sexy colossus in Rubenesque recline. For a few brief seconds, we all stare at what many believe is the greatest city in the world. It is, I have found, an easier place to love at this distance. Climbing the helix each evening used to be an ideal time to assess my day of scurrying about at the feet of those majestic behemoths. Twinkling against a glowing sky, the city said goodbye in its own way and I returned the favor. If on that day the city opened up before me like a giant, improbable rose — it happens — I would blow it a kiss. If, on the other hand, the city had had its way with me, punishing without mercy, I deployed one of my fingers as a gesture of rebuke. Most often, though, the city had both punished and uplifted. On those days, I still used the finger, but gave the finger a kiss as I did it. The hybrid gesture, weird I know, was an acknowledgment that even though the city or some of its inhabitants may not have been kind to me, I still loved it anyway. New York doesn’t beg for forgiveness, but I and many others offer it unbidden. Even if I don’t own a piece of it, it owns a piece of me — while I am happy most nights to leave it, I never imagine saying farewell for good. But that reverie has been reframed and mostly ruined. For the past several months, two new apartment buildings have been creeping up over the lip of the helix on the New Jersey side, obscuring what was once a million-dollar view. The buildings are ungainly in their nascent state and very much in the way. Regardless of how they will look once they are finished in shiny skin, they will be solid and opaque, stationed between the helix and Midtown across the river, smack dab in the way of New Jersey commuters who have, for decades, greeted the city in the morning or waved goodbye at night. The Estuary Luxury apartment buildings in Weehawken will rise to 90 feet, according to an article in The Star-Ledger, enough to block the view for many precious seconds but lower than the 160-foot office-and-apartment proposal that was floated back in 1999. I’m sure it will be a lovely place to live, with amenities that include a rooftop deck, a golf simulator, a yoga room and a fire pit. And there is, of course, that incredible view. I don’t mention any of this in the belief that the township of Weehawken or the developers will come to their senses and stop in mid-hammer swing. What’s done is done. (Speaking of which, after coming down the helix and seeing Downtown on fire after the attacks of Sept. 11, I have watched the city rebuild, a time-lapse of recovery the new buildings won’t erase.) But something glorious, a view held in common by thousands of people who come to New York for the same reasons people always have, will now belong to a precious few. It’s not only a perfect metaphor for our times, but a cold fact that I stare at every day. I often mutter oaths, not at the men and women building it — everyone has to work at something — but at the people who decided that a view that is the visual equivalent of Wagnerian opera was something to be auctioned off. Weehawken’s mayor, Richard Turner, told The Star-Ledger that some of the view will be preserved and that for those who want the full expanse, “My answer always is, move here.\\" I’d prefer to stay put. And I will continue the slog into the city, but there will be something missing from my ride. There’s still a brief interlude of New York cityscape I can see from my bus or car seat if I pay attention, but I don’t look that way so much anymore. When I look toward the city, I don’t see the glorious handiwork of human hands — I see what happens when those hands don’t know when to quit. I keep my own hands in my lap and my kisses to myself.

Question: The empty cement truck weighed less than the full cement truck so it was _____ when it was accelerating (A) faster (B) slower Answer:","output":"The empty cement truck weighed less than the full cement truck, so it was (A) faster when it was accelerating. A detailed explanation for the answer: In the context of this question, it is important to consider the key factors that affect the acceleration of a vehicle, such as mass and force. The main difference between an empty cement truck and a full cement truck is the mass of each vehicle. An empty cement truck has a significantly lower mass compared to its full counterpart due to the absence of cement in the mixer drum.  According to Newton's second law of motion, the acceleration of an object is directly proportional to the net force acting on it and inversely proportional to its mass. Mathematically, this can be represented by the formula: Acceleration (a) = Net Force (F) / Mass (m) As the mass of the empty cement truck is lower than that of the full cement truck, the denominator in the equation becomes smaller, provided that the net force acting on both vehicles is the same. Consequently, when the mass decreases, the acceleration increases following the inverse proportionality rule. Additionally, the engine power and torque play significant roles in a vehicle's acceleration. However, when comparing an empty cement truck with a full cement truck, the engine power and torque remain constant, as they are intrinsic properties of the engine itself rather than dependent on the amount of cement in the mixer drum. Hence, keeping factors like engine power and torque constant, and considering the difference in mass between an empty and full cement truck, the empty cement truck will have a greater acceleration when compared to the full cement truck. Finally, in practical scenarios, there are other factors that can affect acceleration, such as tire grip, road conditions, and aerodynamics. Nonetheless, in this particular context, with an explicit focus on mass as the major differentiating factor, the empty cement truck will have a faster acceleration as per Newton's second law of motion."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Lawrence suggests it could be a result of the \\"sins of the father\\".[2] Johns suspects the young man was an associate of gangster Vic Brady (Timothy Farrell).[2]The Gregor siblings return home and Don immediately heads for the liquor cabinet in the living room, pouring himself a drink. He then reminds Marilyn that he is a legal adult, and claims to know what he in doing. Both statements aim to prevent Marilyn from lecturing him on his behavior. They briefly argue and she breaks his glass. Afterwards, Don opens a book safe and retrieves a hidden revolver. As he prepares to leave, Don has a chance encounter with his father Dr. Boris Gregor (Herbert Rawlinson) at the front door. The son exits into the night, while the father enters the home.[2] As his daughter pours a drink for him, the Doctor reveals that he is already aware of Don's association with Vic Brady and his recent arrest. Inspector Johns had notified him with a phone call. But he is not particularly worried, feeling that everything will work out in the end. He blames Don's current behavior on the premature death of Mrs. Gregor and his own upbringing having had the unintentional effect of spoiling the boy.[2]While Marilyn expresses concern over the influence of Brady on Don, her father continues to drink. He then heads for the book safe and discovers that the revolver is missing. He seems aware of his son's secrets, despite his apparent denial concerning his criminal tendencies.[2] The scene shifts to the Hunters' Inn, a bar in Temple City, California, where Don and Brady meet. Don receives his share of the money for his role in a recent robbery. They are then joined by Johns and Lawrence, and briefly \\"cops\\" and \\"crooks\\" (as they call each other) drink together. The policemen provoke Don into a confrontation, and he knocks over Johns' drink. As the officers intended, this gives them the excuse to frisk him. They fail to find the revolver, as he had earlier offered it to Brady for safekeeping. John orders both criminals to leave the bar and they obey.[2]Outside the bar, Brady chastises Don for his impulsive behavior with the officers. Don wants revenge against Johns, but Brady dismisses the idea and reminds his partner that they have other plans. They are going to rob the payroll of the Monterey Theatre, though Don has his doubts about the plan.[2] At the Gregor House, Marilyn has changed into her nightgown while her father sleeps in an armchair, probably drunk. She wakes him up to discuss their concern over Don's nocturnal activities. The father states that he can't see his own son as a wrongdoer. But he also expresses guilt over his own failure as a father.[2] In the theatre, Cotton Watts performs in blackface. After his act, which involves comedy, dancing, and orchestra music, the theatre closes for the night. Brady and Don break into the closed theatre and ambush the nightwatchman (Bud Osborne).[2]The nightwatchman is forced at gunpoint to open the safe for the criminals. At this point Miss Willis (Mona McKinnon), a bookkeeper, end her shift and attempts to leave the building. She startles the criminals, and the robbery starts having casualties. Don shoots and kills the nightwatchman, while Brady shoots the fleeing woman in the back. Afterwards Brady collects their loot while Don seems to be in shock over his own actions. The two criminals flee while police sirens are heard approaching the theatre. A car chase scene follows, with the driving Brady managing to lead their car to safety.[2] At the theatre, a doctor examines the wounded Willis, while Johns receives the basic information on the case: robbery, murder, and attempted murder. The nightwatchman is identified as a recently retired veteran of the police force, who took his last the job just to relieve his boredom. The officers decide to treat this case as one involving cop killers.[2] The press has already arrived at the murder scene, in the person of a female reporter (Regina Claire) and her photographer.[2]Brady leads Don to the residence of his gun moll, Loretta (Tedi Thurman). While he explains their situation to her, Don leaves unnoticed. When Loretta notices his absence, Brady decides to search for him.[2] The following night, Don wanders the streets until deciding to visit his father's office. He confesses the murder to his father, and the doctor urges him to surrender to the police. The guilt-ridden Don agrees to do so eventually, but wishes for more time to think things through. His father helps him escape the arriving police. While fleeing Don is captured by Brady, who drives him back to Loretta's residence. The three of them listen to the radio, where the case of Paul McKenna (the nightwatchman)'s murder is covered and both their names are announced as murder suspects. Also mentioned in the broadcast is that Don is the son of a famous plastic surgeon.[2] Don repeatedly expresses his decision to surrender and face the consequences of his actions. Fearing for his own safety, Brady kills his partner. The corpse is temporarily stored behind a curtain.[2]An argument between Brady and Loretta follows. She accuses him of destroying everything and everybody that comes in contact with him, while Brady reminds her that he once rescued her from the gutter. He insists that she should stay by his side to the end. The two end the argument in an embrace. At this point, Brady conceives a plan to elude the police by undergoing plastic surgery.[2] He contacts Dr. Gregor, claiming that he is holding Don hostage until plastic surgery is completed. The doctor decides to have Marilyn assist him, since she is a trained nurse.[2]Days later, Lawrence attempt to romance Marilyn, with the ulterior motive of seeking further information on Don. She coldly turns him down. Later than night, Brady, the doctor, Loretta, and Marilyn gather in preparation of the operation. Brady expresses his distrust of the Gregors and has to be convinced that anesthesia is necessary. With Brady sedated, Don searches Loretta's residence for a water basin. He finds it, but also finds Don's stored corpse. He keeps this a secret and maintains a facade of calmness while performing and completing the operation. He claims that the bandages covering Brady's face have to stay on for two weeks. The necessity of a second visit saves his life and that of his daughter, as Loretta had orders to kill them both once the operation was over.[2]Two weeks later, Brady and Loretta arrive to the Gregor residence on schedule. But so do Johns and Lawrence, who were both summoned by the doctor. They want to know who the bandaged man is. When Brady's bandages are removed, his new face is revealed to be modeled after that of Don. Besides the Doctor, everyone else considers him to be the wanted murderer. And the Doctor claims that the man is his son. A horrified Brady attempts to flee and is killed in a shootout with the police. His dying body falls into a swimming pool.[2] A:","output":"Question: In which city does the police car move through the streets? Answer: Alhambra, California. Question: Why was Don Gregor arrested?

Ten years later, on the day before Thanksgiving, prominent private practice Manhattan child psychiatrist, Dr. Nathan R. Conrad (Michael Douglas), is invited by his friend and former colleague, Dr. Louis Sachs (Oliver Platt), to examine a disturbed young lady named Elisabeth Burrows (Brittany Murphy) at the state sanatorium. Having been released from prison on November 4, Patrick and the remaining gang members break into an apartment which overlooks Nathan's apartment, where he lives with his wife Aggie (Famke Janssen) and daughter Jessie (Skye McCole Bartusiak). That evening, Patrick kidnaps the psychiatrist's daughter as a means of forcing him to acquire a six-digit number from Elisabeth's memory. As Nathan visits Elisabeth, she is reluctant at first, but he gains her trust laterâespecially when he reveals that his daughter has been kidnapped and will be killed if he doesn't get the number they want. Dr. Sachs admits to Nathan that the gang who kidnapped Jessie also kidnapped his girlfriend to force him to acquire the number from Elisabeth. Sachs is then visited by Detective Sandra Cassidy (Jennifer Esposito) who reveals to him that his girlfriend has been found dead.

The kidnappers send one of them to kill Aggie while the others escape with Jessie, but Aggie sets an ambush and kills him. After Nathan takes Elisabeth out of the sanatorium, she remembers certain events regarding the gang. It is revealed that Elisabeth's dad was a member of the gang that committed the robbery ten years prior and that he double-crossed them and took the stolen gem.

Two neighboring dairy farms produced milk for half the state.  Berry farm produced conventional milk, while Rose farm produced organic milk.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which farm had milk production which reduced leaching of nitrates?  Hint: Compared to conventional milk production, organic milk production tends to have lower eutrophication potential per ton of milk or per hectare of farmland, because it potentially reduces leaching of nitrates (NO3−) and phosphates (PO4−) due to lower fertilizer application rates. Because organic milk production reduces pesticides utilization, it increases land use per ton of milk due to decreased crop yields per hectare. Mainly due to the lower level of concentrates given to cows in organic herds, organic dairy farms generally produce less milk per cow than conventional dairy farms. Because of the increased use of roughage and the, on-average, lower milk production level per cow, some research has connected organic milk production with increases in the emission of methane.Animal welfare issues vary among dairy farms and are not necessarily related to the way of producing milk (organically or conventionally).

Summarize this article: Former schoolteacher Mary Kay Letourneau and husband Vili Fualaau, with whom she began a sexual relationship when he was her sixth-grade student in Seattle in 1996, have legally separated and a reconciliation seems unlikely, PEOPLE confirms.      “They’ve been having issues for a while now,” says a source close to the couple. “They tried to work through them, but it didn’t work. They’re still committed to being good parents to their children.”      There is no third party involved in the relationship, the source says.      Letourneau’s friend and former attorney David Gehrke says it was Fualaau who filed for separation.      “She could try to contest it, but that’s legally tough to do,” he says. “Perhaps if they want to figure out about the children and child support, but their kids are getting pretty old now.”      “When one person is unhappy in the relationship, the other person can’t be happy either,” he continues. “And there are two people in this relationship.”      Their initial affair — which began while Letourneau was a 34-year-old mother of four and Fualaau was 12 — ignited national controversy and revulsion, particularly after she defied a court order to stay away from Fualaau. “The two of them want to be together,” a friend of Letourneau’s told PEOPLE in a 1998 cover story. “They’re drawn together like magnets.”      Prosecutors took a different view, arguing at the time that Letourneau “doesn’t believe she did anything wrong.”      After the relationship was revealed, she pleaded guilty to two counts of second-degree child rape and was sentenced to seven and a half years in prison.      She and Fualaau married in May 2005 after she was released, and they have two children.      “I’m convinced they were totally in love,” Gehrke says.

Fualaau, then 22, said he sometimes wondered about the past.      “I think, What would my life have been like if I had never made a move on Mary?” he said. “What if I had kept it as a crush and left it at that? Where would I be and where would she be — what would life be like?”      But he said he didn’t see an answer to such speculation. “I can never see more than the question.”      • Want to keep up with the latest crime coverage?

Do you think the right answer to the question \\"what do cancer cells produce?\\" is \\"direct energy\\", given that  cancer cells produce antibodies? Answer:","output":"No, the right answer to the question \\"what do cancer cells produce?\\" is not \\"direct energy\\". Cancer cells have multiple properties and functions that distinguish them from normal cells. While they may produce some proteins or molecules, their primary characteristic is uncontrolled and rapid growth. Cancer cells do not typically produce antibodies. Antibodies are proteins produced by the immune system, specifically by B cells (a type of white blood cell), to bind and neutralize foreign substances or pathogens. Although cancer cells can evade the immune system and may induce abnormal immune responses, they do not produce antibodies themselves. Instead, cancer cells produce various substances as a result of their unregulated growth and altered metabolism. For example, they can secrete growth factors to promote their own growth and survival, enzymes to degrade the extracellular matrix and facilitate invasion, and angiogenic factors to stimulate new blood vessel formation, which supports their nutrient and oxygen requirements. It is through their altered metabolism that cancer cells generate energy for their growth and survival, primarily through a process known as aerobic glycolysis or the Warburg effect. Despite the availability of oxygen, cancer cells preferentially use glycolysis to produce energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) from glucose, at a higher rate than normal cells. This phenomenon allows cancer cells to support their rapid proliferation but is less efficient in terms of ATP production compared to oxidative phosphorylation, which is the primary mode of energy production in normal cells. In conclusion, cancer cells do not produce \\"direct energy\\" or antibodies. They generate energy through altered metabolic processes, primarily aerobic glycolysis, and are characterized by uncontrolled growth and invasion."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Canadian world number 48 is suing the USTA for damages after suffering concussion at the Grand Slam in New York in September. The USTA claim Bouchard should not have gone into the treatment room without \\"express consent of, or accompaniment of, authorised personnel\\". Bouchard, 21, is seeking compensation for lost income and medical costs. She withdrew from the US Open prior to a fourth-round match after the fall and pulled out of her comeback event at the China Open on 5 October because of dizziness. The lawsuit alleges Bouchard slipped on \\"a foreign and dangerous substance\\" in New York and also claims that the injury has damaged her quality of life. However, in its legal response to Bouchard's claims, the USTA claims that \\"as a highly ranked and/or seeded professional tennis player, the plaintiff was experienced and well-versed in the procedures and protocols of the women's tour\\" and \\"knew or should have known the procedures and protocol as they related to the operation of the physiotherapy room\\". It also disputes Bouchard's claim that the physiotherapy room was dark, insisting that even with the main lights turned off, \\"twilight lighting\\" remains on at the Flushing Meadows venue. The USTA add that any suggestion that Bouchard would have won titles in Tokyo - a tournament from which she withdrew - and Beijing - where she retired from her first-round match when trailing Andrea Petkovic - had she not suffered her fall were \\"entirely speculative and uncertain\\". It also claims that Bouchard left the New York venue without taking up offers of medical help after her fall. Bouchard's lawyer Benedict Morelli told the New York Times in October that they could be seeking damages worth \\"millions and millions\\". The case is now set to be heard by a jury. What is a summary of this text?","output":"The Canadian tennis player, Eugenie Bouchard, ranked 48th in the world, is currently in a legal dispute with the United States Tennis Association (USTA). Bouchard's lawsuit comes as a result of a concussion she suffered during the Grand Slam event in New York in September, for which she blames the USTA.  Claiming that she slipped on a \\"foreign and dangerous substance\\" in a treatment room, Bouchard is seeking compensation for the income she lost and the medical expenses she incurred due to the injury. The concussion led Bouchard to withdraw from the US Open prior to a fourth-round match, and later forced her to pull out of the China Open where she experienced dizziness. Bouchard's lawsuit suggests that this incident not only caused her physical harm, but greatly affected her quality of life. However, the USTA has contested these claims, arguing that as a professional tennis player, Bouchard should have known better than to enter the treatment room unescorted by authorised personnel. The USTA also refutes Bouchard's claim that the room was dark at the time of the incident, stating that \\"twilight lighting\\" is always on at the Flushing Meadows location. In addition, the USTA argues that any speculation that Bouchard would have won titles at subsequent tournaments in Tokyo and Beijing had she not been injured is uncertain and purely conjecture. The association maintains that Bouchard declined offers for medical assistance after her fall in New York.

Melancholia is a term that historically referred to an emotional state of deep sadness or overwhelming gloominess. It is seen as a negative emotional state one would prefer to avoid. As such, a sentence that indicates someone is causing another person to enter a state of melancholia would also be seen as negative. Combining these two elements - Friel's manipulative actions and Williams' melancholic state - the overall sentiment of the sentence is perceived as negative. The sentence suggests that Friel is contributing to Williams' negative feelings, either intentionally or unintentionally, which generates a sense of sympathy for Williams and possibly disapproval for Friel's actions, further reinforcing the negative sentiment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Given the question: What do you put around a garden to keep animals out? Choose the most suitable option to answer the above question. Options：  A. park  B. fence  C. ground  D. vines  E. full bloom The answer is:","output":"B. fence To protect your garden from unwanted animals, the most suitable option among the choices provided is to install a fence around it. A fence serves as a physical barrier that not only deters animals from entering your garden but also helps to prevent them from causing damage to your plants, flowers, and vegetables. There are various types of fences that can be used to keep animals away from your garden, and the kind of fence you choose depends on which animals you want to keep out. Here is a rundown of some fencing options and the animals they are most effective against: 1. Wire mesh fencing: This type of fencing is comprised of a fine mesh made from galvanized wire which is ideal for keeping out small animals such as rabbits and rodents. The small gaps in the mesh make it difficult for these animals to squeeze through the fence. 2. Picket fencing: Picket fences are a classic garden fencing option that consists of evenly spaced vertical wooden boards. While not as effective as wire mesh in keeping out smaller animals, they are ideal for preventing larger animals like deer from entering your garden. 3. Electric fencing: Electric fences deliver a mild, non-lethal electric shock when touched, deterring animals from attempting to breach the fence. This type of fencing is particularly effective against larger animals like deer, raccoons, and squirrels, and can be used in conjunction with other fence types for added protection. 4. Chicken wire: This type of fencing is made of thin, flexible wire shaped into a hexagonal pattern resembling the appearance of chicken wire. It is less sturdy than wire mesh fencing but can be effective in warding off small animals if properly installed. 5. Fencing with natural materials: If you prefer a more natural approach, consider constructing a fence from materials like bamboo, willow, or brushwood. These types of fences can still provide an effective barrier against various animals while blending in seamlessly with your garden's surroundings. In summary, a fence is the most effective option for protecting your garden from animals. Depending on the type of animals you are attempting to keep out, you should choose a fencing option that best meets your specific needs. By properly installing and maintaining your fence, you can enjoy a thriving garden, free from the threat posed by unwanted animal intruders."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question \\"What will happen to Taylor?\\", is \\"punish Skylar\\" a valid answer? Answer:","output":"No, \\"punish Skylar\\" is not a valid answer to the question \\"What will happen to Taylor?\\" as it does not directly address the consequences or outcomes that Taylor might face. Instead, the answer focuses on a potential action taken against Skylar. While it is possible that there may be some relationship or connection between Taylor's actions and any repercussions Skylar might face, the question specifically asks for the consequences pertaining to Taylor. Given the scenario, a more appropriate answer would explore the various possibilities that could arise for Taylor after restoring the power to Skylar's position. Some potential outcomes for Taylor might include: 1. Taylor could receive recognition or praise: Depending on the circumstances that led to Skylar's change in course and Taylor's role in restoring power to Skylar's position, it might be possible for Taylor to be recognized for their efforts and actions. This could result in a positive outcome for Taylor, such as getting promoted, receiving a bonus, or becoming a key member of a team. 2. Taylor could face questioning or scrutiny: Depending on the organization and the nature of Skylar's change of actions as well as the restoration of power to their position, Taylor may face questions or scrutiny from a higher authority within the organization. This may occur if the actions are considered unusual or suspicious, requiring further clarification or investigation. 3. The relationship between Taylor and Skylar could be impacted: Taylor's actions to support and restore power to Skylar's position may serve to strengthen the rapport between the two. This could lead to better collaboration or interdependence in future ventures. Conversely, if Skylar perceives Taylor's actions as interference, it might create tension or resentment between them. The impact on their relationship might also influence how others within the organization perceive or interact with Taylor. 4. Possible consequences from different stakeholders: Based on the organization's culture and the context of Taylor's actions, various stakeholders might respond differently to Taylor's decision. For instance, Taylor's colleagues might appreciate the support and restoration of power to Skylar's position, while superiors might question the rationale behind such actions. 5. Lessons learned and self-growth: Lastly, Taylor's actions could prompt introspection and self-analysis regarding the values, beliefs, and limits that led them to restore power to Skylar's position. This could lead to personal growth and modified behavior to better align with their newfound understanding of the situation. In conclusion, the answer to the question \\"What will happen to Taylor?\\" should consider the potential scenarios and future outcomes that Taylor might face, rather than focusing on the actions taken against another individual, like punishing Skylar."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

As of 2017 the village's government employed 69 people full-time, including their building department, planning board, department of public works, the recreation department, the police department, the architectural review advisory committee, and the conservation advisory council. The village government administered a 2017–18 operating budget of approximately 28 million which predominantly went towards public works, police protection, debt service, and recreational facilities and services.Briarcliff Manor maintains a voting custom that dates to at least around 1905.

The information given is: - A man is performing dangerous job duties - We are querying if this man is a tall human performing Given these data points, let's consider the statements and their implications: Statement 1: \\"A man performing dangerous job duties.\\" This statement informs us that there is an individual, identified as a man, who is performing tasks that involve risks or hazards. These tasks are part of his job. However, this statement does not provide any information about the physical characteristics of the man, such as his height or appearance. Statement 2: \\"A tall human performing.\\" This statement is a general one that describes any human, regardless of gender, who is tall and performing an activity. There is no mention of the activity being dangerous or part of a job. The primary focus of this statement is the characteristic of height. Given these two statements, it is challenging to establish a direct link between them, as they primarily focus on different aspects. The first statement concentrates on the nature of the job duties and their inherent risks, while the second statement focuses on the height of an individual engaged in some activity. By looking at these statements, we can neither confirm nor deny the possibility that the man from the first statement is, indeed, a tall human performing. There simply isn't enough information to draw a definitive conclusion. The man in the first statement could be short or tall, or even of average height. Likewise, the second statement could refer to someone performing a dangerous job or a completely unrelated activity.

Jeffrey walked his dog in the park instead of at the lake, because the","output":"park offered a safer and more diverse environment for both him and his canine companion to explore. Under the watchful eye of towering trees and amidst a symphony of songbirds, the park offered a variety of play areas, lush gardens, well-maintained trails, and opportunities for socializing with other dog owners in the designated dog zones. As opposed to the lake area, which although stunning, was much less regulated and carried a higher risk of potential dangers for his beloved pet such as pollution, wildlife threats, and insufficiently maintained trails. Additionally, the park had rules in place to enhance the experience for all visitors, including strictly enforced leash requirements, ensuring that every dog in the park was kept under safe control, reducing the risk of unexpected confrontations. The park also provided an array of wildlife observation opportunities, ranging from squirrels scurrying up trees to ducks floating gracefully on the placid pond, allowing for a tranquil escape from the urban atmosphere and a refreshing immersion into nature. Visiting the park was not only beneficial for his dog's physical health but also for Jeffrey's own well-being. Strolling around the park and observing happy, playful dogs provided a much-needed stress relief. The park's multiple benches, shaded areas, and well-maintained lawns allowed Jeffrey to take a break from his hectic life, breathe in the fresh air, and connect with others in a friendly, welcoming space. He found this quite therapeutic and made lasting connections with other dog owners while sharing their mutual love for their furry friends. Moreover, the park's dedication to dog-friendly amenities was impressive, from readily available water fountains for dogs to strategically placed waste disposal stations with doggy bags, making it convenient for Jeffrey to take care of his pet's needs while adhering to the park's cleanliness rules. On the other hand, the lake area did not have such facilities, and this concern also played a part in his decision to choose the park. In conclusion, Jeffrey's choice to walk his dog at the park instead of the lake was a well-thought-out decision, grounded in safety considerations, accessibility to pet-friendly amenities, and opportunities for relaxation, exercise, and forging connections with fellow pet owners. While the lake held its own charm, the park was a more practical and enjoyable choice for both Jeffrey and his dog, ensuring they could maximize their bonding experience in a delightful environment suited to their needs."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Though opposition to his theory continues, it is the elegant explanation of how species evolutes through natural selection that makes his 200th birthday such a major event. More than 300 celebrations have been planned in Britain alone, where Darwin's face graces  the 10-pound bill along with that of Queen Elizabeth II. Shrewsbury, the central England town where Darwin was born and raised, is holding a month-long festival for its most famous son. Down House, his former home near London, will hold a permanent exhibition recreating some of his most famous experiments. Many more events have been planned all over the world.

At one time this statement was true, but no longer. Since the 1960s, we have sent many spacecraft into space. Some are still traveling away from Earth. So it is possible to overcome gravity. Do you need a giant rocket to overcome gravity? No, you actually overcome gravity every day. Think about when you climb a set of stairs. When you do, you are overcoming gravity. What if you jump on a trampoline? You are overcoming gravity for a few seconds. Everyone can overcome gravity. You just need to apply a force larger than gravity.

One man's rate went from 9.5% to 16.99%: \\"It almost borders on loan-sharking\\" Citigroup, recipient of bailout funds, seems to be the target of most bloggers' ire. U.S. House passes \\"bill of rights\\" for customers, but legislation stalls in Senate. Citi says anyone unhappy with rate can opt out and close account when card expires. Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Title: Credit Card Changes: Understanding Interest Rates and New Rules Do you know how a credit card works? When you use a credit card, you are actually borrowing money from the bank. Just like when you borrow a toy from your friend and have to return it later, you have to return the money to the bank. But the bank also wants something in return for letting you use their money, so they charge a fee. This fee is called 'interest,' and they show it as a percentage. Now, some people are not happy because the banks have changed the interest rates on their credit cards. Imagine if your friend, who always lets you borrow toys for 3 days, suddenly says you can only borrow for 2 days. That would not be very nice, right? That's how some people are feeling right now. A man had a credit card with an interest rate of 9.5% and the bank changed it to 16.99% without asking. That's like if your ice cream cone went from costing 10 jellybeans to 17 jellybeans – a big difference! The man says it's almost like \\"loan-sharking.\\" Loan-sharking is a term people use when someone lends money but charges way too much for it. This happened with a bank called Citigroup, and a lot of people on the internet are talking about it because they are also upset. But then the U.S. House came to rescue! They passed something called a \\"bill of rights\\" for people who use credit cards. This bill of rights says that banks must be nicer and fairer to customers.  However, getting these rules to work is not so easy. The rules are stuck in a big room called the Senate. This is like when your parents say they will buy you a toy but then change their minds. The Senate needs to agree on the rules before they can become real. Citigroup, the bank we talked about earlier, said that anyone who is unhappy with the new interest rate can choose to close their account when the card expires. That means they can say \\"No, thank you\\" to the bank when their card becomes old and stops working. So, in simple words, some people are upset because their interest rates went up, but there are new rules in the works to protect customers. The important thing is that everyone should understand how their credit cards work and always be careful when borrowing money."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  After the Great War, Moore received an ex-serviceman's grant to continue his education and in 1919 he became a student at the Leeds School of Art (now Leeds College of Art), which set up a sculpture studio especially for him. At the college, he met Barbara Hepworth, a fellow student who would also become a well-known British sculptor, and began a friendship and gentle professional rivalry that lasted for many years. In Leeds, Moore also had access to the modernist works in the collection of Sir Michael Sadler, the University Vice-Chancellor, which had a pronounced effect on his development. In 1921, Moore won a scholarship to study at the Royal College of Art in London, along with Hepworth and other Yorkshire contemporaries. While in London, Moore extended his knowledge of primitive art and sculpture, studying the ethnographic collections at the Victoria and Albert Museum and the British Museum. The student sculptures of both Moore and Hepworth followed the standard romantic Victorian style, and included natural forms, landscapes and figurative modelling of animals. Moore later became uncomfortable with classically derived ideals; his later familiarity with primitivism and the influence of sculptors such as Constantin Brâncuși, Jacob Epstein, Henri Gaudier-Brzeska and Frank Dobson led him to the method of direct carving, in which imperfections in the material and marks left by tools became part of the finished sculpture. Having adopted this technique, Moore was in conflict with academic tutors who did not appreciate such a modern approach. During one exercise set by Derwent Wood (the professor of sculpture at the Royal College), Moore was asked to reproduce a marble relief of Domenico Rosselli's The Virgin and Child by first modelling the relief in plaster, then reproducing it in marble using the mechanical aid known as a \\"pointing machine\\", a technique called \\"pointing\\". Instead, he carved the relief directly, even marking the surface to simulate the prick marks that would have been left by the pointing...","output":"The individual who assigned the pointing machine assignment to the man who would later use the Chac Mool as a motif was Derwent Wood, the professor of sculpture at the Royal College of Art in London.  Derwent Wood provided the pointing machine assignment as a means to teach traditional sculpting techniques that were prevalent during the time. The assignment required the students to reproduce a marble relief of Domenico Rosselli's The Virgin and Child, initially modeling the relief in plaster and then creating it in marble using the pointing machine.  However, the man who would later incorporate the Chac Mool motif, Henry Moore, challenged the conventional methods taught by his academic tutors, including Derwent Wood. Moore had embraced modernist ideals through the influence of other sculptors, such as Constantin Brâncuși, Jacob Epstein, Henri Gaudier-Brzeska, and Frank Dobson. These artists inspired Moore to adopt the method of direct carving, a technique that deviated from classical sculpting approaches and incorporated imperfections and tool marks as part of the finished sculpture. Rather than following the specific assignment given by Derwent Wood, Moore decided to carve the relief directly using the direct carving approach he had come to appreciate. This was a bold move on his part since it was in direct conflict with the traditional techniques that his academic tutors, including Wood, expected from their students. By doing so, Moore demonstrated his commitment to modernism and direct carving, paving the way for his future work as an innovative and influential sculptor who would famously incorporate the Chac Mool motif into his art. Throughout his career, Moore would continue to push the boundaries of sculpting and inspire future generations of artists, contributing significantly to the development of modern sculpture."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

We can do this by subtracting 182 from both sides: 13*g = -182 Step 3: Finally, to find the value of g, we simply divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of g, which is 13: g = -182 / 13 Step 4: Simplify the division: g = -14 So the solution for the given linear equation is g = -14."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He is the driving force behind one of the world's biggest football clubs, Real Madrid, and reached 100 goals for Los Blancos faster than any other player in the Spanish champion's 111-year history. But the Portugal star admits that, behind the bravado and on-field posturing, he and his teammates are feeling the strain of the expectation that surrounds the Madrid club. Real's stuttering start to the season leaves them 18 points adrift of Spanish First Division leaders and archrivals Barcelona, with the club's fans now demanding coach Jose Mourinho lead Los Blancos to a record 10th triumph in Europe's premier club competition by way of compensation. Real must overcome Manchester United in their last 16 clash if they are to win the European Champions League for the first time in 11 years -- a tie which will see Ronaldo return to the club where he announced himself as a world-class talent before leaving for Madrid in 2009 in a deal worth 129 million. \\"I've been here for three-and-a-half years now,\\" the 27-year-old told FIFA's official website. \\"Everyone involved is totally focused on winning the club's 10th European Cup.

It's not going to be easy and I reckon the odds are about 50-50, but I'm still very confident.\\" However, the worry for Spanish champions Real is that their team has been relatively inconsistent this season. While Barca have notched up a record 18 wins from the same amount of games during the current campaign, Mourinho's team have lost four and drawn four of their first 19 matches. The crowd at the 85,000-seater Santiago Bernabeu stadium have targeted their frustrations at Mourinho -- a Champions League winner with both Porto and Inter Milan -- and Ronaldo. \\"We haven't started the championship very well for sure,\\" Ronaldo continued. \\"We know that La Liga's an uphill struggle for us now, but nothing's impossible in football. We're going to work hard, win games and see what happens. He added: \\"I'm able to respect those who criticize me, because I know they've got the wrong idea about me.

United manager Alex Ferguson admitted recently he would like to see Ronaldo return to Old Trafford, but the Madeira-born striker has moved to quell talk of an imminent move by saying he wishes to see out the remainder of his contract at Real, which expires in 2015. \\"I want to see out my contract at Real Madrid; I'm very clear about that,\\" he said. \\"After that, well, I don't know what'll happen in the future.\\" And head of February's contest between Real and United, Ronaldo is confidence his current club can overcome his former employers. \\"No team's unbeatable, but when we're at our best we're a really good side.

In their natural habitat, bettas live in murky, stagnant water. Although they can survive in very small, cramped tanks, it's healthier for the fish to give it a larger environment.","output":"The most logical next event after choosing a tank for your betta fish is to set up the tank to ensure it provides an ideal and healthy environment for your betta fish to thrive. Here are the steps to set up and acclimate your betta fish to their new home: 1. Clean the tank: Before adding any water or decorations, thoroughly rinse the tank with warm water to remove any dust or residue. Do not use any soap or cleaning chemicals as these can harm your betta fish. 2. Choose a location: Select a location for your tank away from direct sunlight, heat sources, and drafts. It's essential to maintain a stable water temperature for your betta, as sudden fluctuations can stress them out. 3. Add substrate: Use gravel or sand as a substrate in your betta tank, rinsing it well before adding it to the tank. A layer of about 2 to 3 inches is sufficient for most tanks. 4. Install the heater and filter: Bettas thrive in water temperatures between 76 and 82°F, so a heater and thermometer will help maintain a stable temperature. Choose a filter appropriate for your tank size that provides gentle water flow to mimic their natural environment. 5. Decorate the tank: Add silk or live plants, rocks, and other decorations to provide hiding places and enrichment opportunities for your betta. Be cautious of sharp objects that might damage the betta's delicate fins. 6. Fill the tank: Fill the tank with water and use a water conditioner to neutralize harmful substances like chlorine and heavy metals. Let the filter and heater run for at least 24 hours to stabilize water parameters. 7. Cycle the tank: Before introducing your betta, it's crucial to establish the nitrogen cycle by adding beneficial bacteria to your filter. You can do this by using a cycling product or adding some filter media from an established aquarium. This process may take a few weeks, but it's worth the wait to ensure a healthy environment for your betta. 8. Acclimate your betta: After the tank is properly set up and cycled, it's time to introduce your betta fish. Float the bag containing your betta in the tank for 15-20 minutes, so they can adjust to the tank's temperature. Then, add a small amount of tank water to the bag every 5-10 minutes for another 15-20 minutes. This will help your betta adjust to the new water parameters gradually. Finally, gently release your betta into the tank using a small net. 9. Establish a feeding schedule: Bettas are carnivorous, so choose high-quality betta-specific pellets or flakes and supplement their diet with frozen or live brine shrimp and bloodworms. Feed your betta fish once or twice daily, providing an amount they can consume within 2-3 minutes. 10. Maintain the tank: Regularly check water parameters, clean the filter, and perform partial water changes (20-25% of the tank volume) every week to maintain a healthy environment for your betta. By following these steps, you can create a comfortable home for your betta fish and improve its overall wellbeing and longevity."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What is the full name of the man who was attacked in 1679 next to the pub known for bare-knuckle fights? from the following article ?  The Covent Garden area has over 60 pubs and bars; several of them are listed buildings, with some also on CAMRA's National Inventory of Historic Pub Interiors; some, such as The Harp in Chandos Place, have received consumer awards. The Harp's awards include London Pub of the Year in 2008 by the Society for the Preservation of Beers from the Wood, and National Pub of the Year by CAMRA in 2010. It was at one time owned by the Charrington Brewery, when it was known as The Welsh Harp; in 1995 the name was abbreviated to just The Harp, before Charrington sold it to Punch Taverns in 1997. It was eventually purchased by the landlady Binnie Walsh around 2010 then subsequently sold by her to Fuller's Brewery in 2014.  It continues to win regular CAMRA pub awards under its new owners. The Lamb and Flag in Rose Street is possibly the oldest pub in the area. The first mention of a pub on the site is 1772 (when it was called the Cooper's Arms – the name changing to Lamb & Flag in 1833); the 1958 brick exterior conceals what may be an early 18th-century frame of a house replacing the original one built in 1638. The pub acquired a reputation for staging bare-knuckle prize fights during the early 19th century when it earned the nickname \\"Bucket of Blood\\". The alleyway beside the pub was the scene of an attack on John Dryden in 1679 by thugs hired by John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester, with whom he had a long-standing conflict.The Salisbury in St Martin's Lane was built as part of a six-storey block around 1899 on the site of an earlier pub that had been known under several names, including the Coach & Horses and Ben Caunt's Head; it is both Grade II listed, and on CAMRA's National Inventory, due to the quality of the etched and polished glass and the carved woodwork, summed up as \\"good fin de siècle ensemble\\".

Simone Biles, the newest Olympic all-around champion (Photo: Robert Hanashiro, USA TODAY Sports)      RIO DE JANEIRO — Ron Biles, the father of the gymnastics superstar who has taken the Rio Games by storm … graceful storm … had a short and simple response when asked how he would feel about fans naming newborn girls after his daughter Simone.      “It would make me smile,” Biles told USA TODAY Sports.      In that case, Biles can count of doing plenty of smiling in the years to come. According to two baby naming experts, the success of Simone Biles in gymnastics and Simone Manuel in the swimming pool in Rio is likely to lead to a huge spike in babies given that name this year.      “In recent times parents have liked to search for a meaning, or something inspirational in the names they give their children,” Laura Wattenberg, author of Baby Name Wizard, told USA TODAY Sports by telephone. “They want to be able to tell their children a story and not just give them a name that’s nothing more than a collection of letters.”      Current trends have leaned away from girls’ names with harder sounds, for example like Mildred or Gertrude, and towards those with softer tones, like Emma. Or Simone.      “With a pair of athletes who are not only successful but seen as great role models, combined with a softer sound, it is like hitting the jackpot,” Wattenberg added.      Combined with the release of a biopic about iconic jazz musician Nina Simone, Wattenberg said the name paints a firm picture of “a strong African American woman.”      Biles became the first black world gymnastics champion in 2013 and is in contention for a haul of five gold medals in Rio. Manuel became the first African American female gold medalist in an individual event when she won the 100-meter freestyle on Thursday night, the same day that Biles took the individual all-around.      An Olympic name that takes off in popularity has to both carry the right message, and be unusual enough to be distinctive. Michael Phelps might have enough gold to open a jewelry store but the name “Michael” is unlikely to shift in usage much as a result.      However, Nadia, Katarina, Bode, McKayla, and even Sonja have received an Olympic boost, thanks to Comaneci, Witt, Miller, Maroney and Henie, the 1920s and 30s ice skating star.      “Millennial parents are looking for something different to a long-standing traditional name,” said Julia Wang, head of digital content for pregnancy and parenting site The Bump. “When we see cultural phenomenons that affect the world stage it subconsciously affects parents. Simone Biles and Simone Manuel fit that category very strongly.”      Gymnasts have a track record of social impact. After the Magnificent Seven won team gold in Atlanta in 1996, Jaycie (Phelps) and Dominique (Moceanu and Dawes) experienced a temporary rise that and the following year, before later dropping off.      Simone was at its most popular (310th) in 1988, but has dipped recently and was the 821st most used female name in 2015. “That is definitely going to change,” Wattenberg said.      However, it should be noted that negative Olympic publicity or notoriety can destroy a name’s popularity. Tonya, once the 97th most popular girl’s name in America, has not appeared in the top 1000 since the fallout from the Tonya Harding/Nancy Kerrigan scandal.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: Whose only known architectural subject is a drawing of the interior of the Old Church  During Ruisdael's last period he began to depict mountain scenes, such as Mountainous and Wooded Landscape with a River, dateable to the late 1670s. This portrays a rugged range with the highest peak in the clouds. Ruisdael's subjects became unusually varied. The art historian Wolfgang Stechow identified thirteen themes within the Dutch Golden Age landscape genre, and Ruisdael's work encompasses all but two of them, excelling at most: forests, rivers, dunes and country roads, panoramas, imaginary landscapes, Scandinavian waterfalls, marines, beachscapes, winter scenes, town views, and nocturnes. Only the Italianate and foreign landscapes other than Scandinavian are absent from his oeuvre.The imaginary landscapes of gardens that Ruisdael painted in the 1670s actually reflect an ongoing discourse on the picturesque in circles of gardening aesthetes like Constantijn Huygens. Slive finds it appropriate that a windmill is the subject of one of Ruisdael's most famous works. Windmill at Wijk bij Duurstede, dated 1670, shows Wijk bij Duurstede, a riverside town about 20 kilometres (12 mi) from Utrecht, with a dominant cylindrical windmill. In this composition, Ruisdael united typical Dutch elements of low-lying land, water and expansive sky, so that they converge on the equally characteristic Dutch windmill. The painting's enduring popularity is evidenced by card sales in the Rijksmuseum, with the Windmill ranking third after Rembrandt's Night Watch and Vermeer's View of Delft. Windmills featured throughout Ruisdael's entire career.Various panoramic views of the Haarlem skyline and its bleaching grounds appear during this stage, a specific genre called Haerlempjes, with the clouds creating various gradations of alternating bands of light and shadow towards the horizon. The paintings are often dominated by Saint Bavo's Church, in which Ruisdael would one day be buried.While Amsterdam does feature in his work, it does so relatively rarely given that Ruisdael lived there for over 25 years.

In 1828 Henry Donnison, a Sydney merchant who had arrived with his wife and family on the brig Ellen on 29–30 July 1828, was granted an allotment on the western side of Stirling Ridge. A second grant was made to William Klensendorlffe (a German who had served in the British Navy and arrived free in the Colony in 1818), who had bought the land from John Stephen, on 7 March 1839. Donnison's land was named Yarralumla in a survey of the area conducted in 1834. Yarralumla was a name for the area used by the local people, apparently meaning \\"echo\\". An area to the west of what is now the suburb was the Yarrolumla parish.The prominent New South Wales parliamentarian Sir Terence Aubrey Murray (1810–1873) purchased Yarralumla in 1837. He lived there with his wife Mary Murray (née Gibbes, 1817–1858), the second daughter of the Collector of Customs for NSW, Colonel John George Nathaniel Gibbes (1787–1873), MLC. In 1859, Murray sold Yarralumla to his brother-in-law, Augustus Onslow Manby Gibbes (1828–1897). Later that same year, Augustus' parents came to live with him at Yarralumla homestead. Augustus Gibbes improved the estate and acquired additional land by purchase and lease. However, In 1881, he sold Yarralumla for 40,000 pounds to Frederick Campbell, a descendant of Robert Campbell, in order to travel overseas. Frederick Campbell erected a new, three-storey, brick house on the site of the former Yarralumla homestead at the beginning of the 1890s. Campbell's house would later form the basis of what is now the Governor-General of Australia's official Canberra residence, known colloquially as \\"Yarralumla\\" or \\"Government House\\". Campbell also built a large wooden woolshed nearby in 1904.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Severance guilty in three high-profile killings in Alexandria An eccentric history buff was found guilty Monday of killing three prominent Alexandria residents over the course of a decade — an outcome that solves one of the D.C. suburb’s highest-profile mysteries and will put the serial killer behind bars for the rest of his life. After deliberating for about 12 1/2 hours over three days, jurors convicted Charles S. Severance, 55, of all of the 10 counts against him. As the verdict was read, two of the victims’ relatives cried and embraced. Severance stared straight ahead and said nothing. Jurors later recommended that he be sentenced in each case to life in prison without the possibility of parole. The judge is expected to formally impose the penalty in January. Severance had been charged with murder in the February 2014 slaying of music teacher Ruthanne Lodato, the November 2013 shooting of regional transportation planner Ronald Kirby and the December 2003 killing of real estate agent Nancy Dunning. Prosecutors said bitterness over a child custody battle that he lost and a general hatred of Alexandria’s elite motivated him to shoot the victims — all apparently strangers to him — in daylight attacks at their homes. [The evidence against Charles Severance] A sense of unease descended on the city after the more recent killings; a locksmith said at the time that he was deluged with phone calls asking about the installation of peepholes. After Monday’s verdict, some relatives of those slain said they finally felt a sense of relief. Elizabeth Dunning, Nancy Dunning’s daughter, told jurors that her family “had long ago stopped believing that this day would come.” Severance’s conviction had “already given us more than we ever expected,” she said. But she urged jurors to consider that she would eventually have to tell her 2- and 6-year-old sons what had happened to their grandmother. “I want to be able to tell them, ‘The man who killed your grandmother is going to be in prison for the rest of his life. He can’t hurt you,’ ” Dunning said. “Please give me those words to say.” Alexandria Police Chief Earl L. Cook, speaking at police headquarters, said that with the conviction, “from this individual, our community has nothing else to fear.” Commonwealth’s Attorney Bryan Porter said, “The reign of the Alexandria assassin is over.” Severance remained quiet throughout Monday’s proceedings — something of a surprise, given his previous outbursts in court. His attorneys said they were considering whether to appeal. Severance’s father, Stan, issued a statement saying the family “respect[s] the verdict.” “We want to express our deepest sympathy to the Dunnings, Kirbys and Lodatos for their losses,” the family’s statement read. “There’s no words to express their loss. Our family is a strong family. We will pursue and continue on.” The verdict and sentence capped an emotional day in which the loved ones of the slain offered tearful descriptions of the pain the crimes had inflicted on them. Marilyn Kirby, Kirby’s daughter, told jurors she had lost “my hero, best friend.” She said she has thought about how her father will not be there to walk her down the aisle on her wedding day. Norman Lodato, Lodato’s widower, said he longed “for a day when the pain is not so great, but those days are few and far between.” Lucia Lodato, Lodato’s daughter, said that her sister is expecting a child in a month and that “being a grandma would have been my mom’s life’s greatest role.” Perhaps most notable, though, were the sentiments of Dunning’s relatives, who described what they had endured for the past 12 years with her murder unsolved. Investigators had long considered Dunning’s husband, former Alexandria sheriff James Dunning, one of their top suspects, though he was never charged with any crime.Patty Moran, Dunning’s sister, said the verdict “will ensure there will once again be peace in our homes and in the city of Alexandria.” He died in 2012. Elizabeth Dunning, the victim’s daughter, said the outcome was bittersweet. “Our relief today is mixed with anguish that our dad is not here standing beside us, finally feeling the weight of cruel and unfair suspicion being lifted from his shoulders,” she said. Cook said the law enforcement community was sorry it had not been able to clear James Dunning before his death. “We can’t go back,” Cook said. “We were never able to do that for him, but hopefully we’ll be able to do that for his survivors.” Porter said he was “happy that we were able to give some solace to the Dunning family and to remove that cloud of suspicion from their father forever.” “Obviously it’s posthumous,” he said. “It’s too late. It doesn’t change that he had to live the last couple years of his life in an unfortunate situation.” At the weeks-long trial, jurors learned that Severance — who watched the proceedings from a wheelchair — was a peculiar man who sometimes seemed to battle psychological demons and other times seemed to lead a normal life. The son of a two-star Navy admiral, Severance lived in various places in his youth and enjoyed traveling, history and gaming. He attended three colleges, ultimately graduating with a mechanical engineering degree from the University of Virginia, and was briefly married. In recent years, he would go over to his parents’ house weekly to watch the TV show “Survivor.” But Severance acted unusually almost throughout his life. Family members said he was vigorously opposed to smoking, even confronting his parents’ guests about it when they came for dinner. When he campaigned for political office in Alexandria in 1996 and 2000, a part of his platform was to encourage “country dancing” in the school system. When he wrote to family members, the missives were often rambling and nonsensical. An expert testified he had a personality disorder with mixed paranoid and schizotypal features. [Family members describe Charles Severance’s unusual behavior] Winning convictions on every count was hardly guaranteed. Prosecutors gave jurors Severance’s voluminous, sometimes violent writings, some of which seemed to describe his crimes. One, for example, said “Knock. Talk. Enter. Kill. Exit. Murder.” But none of the documents mentioned any of the victims by name. Prosecutors linked the three killings with ballistics: An expert testified that a particular type of ammunition was used in all three cases, and those crimes were the only ones the expert had ever seen in which that type of ammunition was used. Severance also wrote of a fondness for that ammunition. But investigators did not recover a murder weapon, and defense attorneys said the ammunition was widely available. Prosecutors had a pivotal eyewitness in the Lodato killing: Janet Dorcas Franko, a home health aide who worked in the Lodato home and who was shot and wounded at the same time Lodato was killed. She identified Severance in court as her attacker, and prosecutors buttressed her testimony with that of a woman who said she had seen him driving in the area at the time and surveillance video of what appeared to be his car. [The testimony from prosecutors’ star witness] In the other cases, the evidence was weaker. A plumber claimed to have seen Severance around Kirby’s house at about the time of his death, but he did not tell police that when he was first interviewed. Prosecutors suggested that Severance was the man caught on a surveillance video possibly following Dunning at a Target store shortly before she was killed. But several of Severance’s friends and relatives disputed that the man on the footage was Severance. After Monday’s hearing ended, the 12 jurors walked briskly from the courthouse to the parking garage, declining to be identified and saying little about how they had reached their decisions. “The verdict stands for itself,” one woman said. Chris Leibig, an attorney for Severance, said in court that although his client was found guilty of murder, jurors should not view his story as “there was an evil man and you convicted him.” He said Severance was a man “who had a lot of potential and a good family” but never got the mental health treatment he needed. “Mr. Severance,” he said, “is not a monster.” Porter said he had considered seeking the death penalty in the case, but the “mental health component” persuaded him not to. Judge Randy I. Bellows is scheduled to formally impose the life sentence, which is required by law in a capital murder case in which death is off the table, on Jan. 22.

In 1974 ministerial government was introduced to the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony through a change to the Constitution. In that year a general election was held; and a referendum was held in December 1974 to determine whether the Gilbert Islands and Ellice Islands should each have their own administration. As a consequence of the referendum, separation occurred in two stages. The Tuvaluan Order 1975, which took effect on 1 October 1975, recognised Tuvalu as a separate British dependency with its own government. The second stage occurred on 1 January 1976 when separate administrations were created out of the civil service of the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony. Try to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What document was changed to cause a change in government?","output":"The document that was changed to cause a change in government in the Gilbert and Ellice Islands Colony was the Constitution. The change in the Constitution introduced ministerial government and led to the subsequent events including a general election, a referendum, and eventually, the separation of Gilbert Islands and Ellice Islands into separate administrations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here are some concepts: abandon, building, staircase What is a sentence about these concepts?","output":"The act of abandoning a dilapidated building, with its crumbling walls and creaky, unstable staircase, may seem like the only viable option at first, but undertaking a thoughtful restoration process can breathe new life into the structure, highlighting its inherent historical value and architectural beauty. In this sentence, the concepts of abandonment, building, and staircase are woven together within the context of an old, neglected building. At first, abandoning the building seems to be the way to go, as its condition has significantly deteriorated over time, with the staircase being a poignant example of its precarious state. However, the sentence also introduces the idea of restoration as a potential solution, suggesting that the building and its architectural elements, like the staircase, can be revived and appreciated for their history and significance. This highlights the creative potential of synthesizing seemingly unrelated concepts into a meaningful idea or statement. By exploring these concepts from multiple angles and considering the implications of their integration, a more complex understanding can emerge. As a result, the sentence serves as a reminder of the rich possibilities that can arise from examining the connections between different concepts and allowing ourselves to consider alternative outcomes and perspectives."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

You must not consider any other information that is not provided in the passage while labelling True or False. Passage: Phagocytosis is an important feature of cellular innate immunity performed by cells called 'phagocytes' that engulf, or eat, pathogens or particles. Phagocytes generally patrol the body searching for pathogens, but can be called to specific locations by cytokines. Once a pathogen has been engulfed by a phagocyte, it becomes trapped in an intracellular vesicle called a phagosome, which subsequently fuses with another vesicle called a lysosome to form a phagolysosome. The pathogen is killed by the activity of digestive enzymes or following a respiratory burst that releases free radicals into the phagolysosome. Phagocytosis evolved as a means of acquiring nutrients, but this role was extended in phagocytes to include engulfment of pathogens as a defense mechanism. Phagocytosis probably represents the oldest form of host defense, as phagocytes have been identified in both vertebrate and invertebrate animals.

As if that wasn’t enough, it then came to light that they have also been tracking and storing users’ phone call and text message data, including “who contacted whom, what time, and how long the conversation was.” This is nothing new, as we can see from this 2012 “study” in which they deliberately manipulated news feeds to influence users’ emotional state. And again with their settlement with the FCC back in 2011 (that they likely violated with their recent offenses) over deceiving consumers by telling them their information was private, but then repeatedly sharing it and making it public. And then there’s The Ugly Memo, in which a FB exec justifies growth at any cost in the name of connecting people, even if that results literally in people dying: We talk about the good and the bad of our work often. I want to talk about the ugly. We connect people. That can be bad if they make it negative. Maybe it costs a life by exposing someone to bullies. Maybe someone dies in a terrorist attack coordinated on our tools. And still we connect people. The ugly truth is that we believe in connecting people so deeply that anything that allows us to connect more people more often is *de facto* good. And up until this most recent Cambridge Analytica scandal, Facebook was negotiating with various healthcare organizations to share patients’ health data with FB so they could match it up to your social circle to allegedly provide better health care.

Suddenly, I heard the children running down the stairs and shouting, \\"Freddie, Freddie.\\" _ My three-year old son Freddie was lying on his side on the ground. I cried for my husband Simon to dial 999 and within minutes the air ambulance arrived. They quickly took him in the helicopter. During the flight, Freddie was looking at me and I remember thinking was a good sign, but then his eyes began to roll. As the doctors tried to stabilize  him, I couldn't believe what was happening. When we arrived at the hospital in Portsmouth, there were some doctors and nurses waiting for us and they immediately set to work on Freddie. I was hopelessly wishing everything would be alright, but Freddie had broken his skull in two places and blood clots were forming in his brain. He needed surgery , and only a surgeon at another hospital in Bristol could do it. This meant another helicopter ride, but we couldn't go with Freddie because there was no enough space. Simon and I drove the long 130 miles from our home in north Devon in silence. Neither of us dared say what we were thinking, \\"What if we get there and he's dead?\\" \\"Is he going to be brain-damaged?\\" Freddie was just coming out of surgery when we arrived. The surgeon said it had gone well. When I finally saw him, I hardly recognize my child--he was covered in tubes and there were wires coming out of his head. On the third day, Simon went home to see our three girls and to pick up some clean clothes for us. While he was gone, the pressure in Freddie's brain suddenly increased. He was taken into theater again and this time I fell apart. Luckily, the surgery managed to stabilize Freddie. After almost a week, Freddie was finally woken up.

Given the background: One of the most adverse impacts of poor waste management, especially municipal waste, is the incidence and prevalence of diseases such as malaria and respiratory problems, as well as other illnesses through the contamination of ground water. Biomedical wastes pose great danger in Bangladesh too as a report estimated that 20% of the biomedical waste is \\"highly infectious\\" and is a hazard since it is often disposed of into the sewage system or drains.[6]  Such poor sanitation has serious consequences for the health of the residents and a report suggests that \\"most of the child mortality could be related with this problem\\".[7]  With regards to the living standards, solid waste leads to blockage in the drainage system which leads to flooding in the streets. Consequently, mosquitoes and bad odour are among the negative impacts resulted.[7]  and the situation: The hospital in Y city had a good disposal site in which they disposed of Biomedical wastes, but the hospital in the neighboring city X had big problems, because the biomedical waste contaminated the ground water and affected the population.  Answer the following question: Which city had less child mortality? The answer to this question is:","output":"Based on the background information provided, it can be assumed that City Y had less child mortality.  Step 1: Identify the factors affecting child mortality in both cities. - In City Y, the hospital has a good disposal site for biomedical wastes, which suggests proper waste management practices are in place. - In City X, the hospital has problems with biomedical waste disposal, leading to groundwater contamination and subsequent negative effects on the population's health. Step 2: Evaluate the relationship between waste management and child mortality. - Poor waste management and sanitation have been linked to an increase in child mortality rates, as mentioned in the background information. Step 3: Compare the waste management practices in both cities. - City Y practices proper disposal of biomedical wastes, making it less likely for diseases and illnesses to spread. - City X has poor waste management practices, resulting in contamination of groundwater and a higher likelihood of diseases and illnesses. Step 4: Draw a conclusion based on the comparison. - With better waste management practices in place, City Y is less likely to have high child mortality rates compared to City X, which is suffering from the adverse effects of poor waste management.

Shackleton's February 1907 announcement that he intended to base his expedition at the old Discovery headquarters was noted by Scott, whose own future Antarctic plans were at that stage unannounced. In a letter to Shackleton, Scott claimed priority rights to McMurdo Sound. \\"I feel I have a sort of right to my own field of work,\\" he wrote, adding: \\"anyone who has had to do with exploration will regard this region primarily as mine\\". He concluded by reminding Shackleton of his duty of loyalty towards his former commander.Shackleton's initial reply was accommodating: \\"I would like to fall in with your views as far as possible without creating a position that would be untenable to myself\\". Edward Wilson, asked by Shackleton to mediate, took an even tougher line than Scott. \\"I think you should retire from McMurdo Sound\\", he wrote, advising Shackleton not to make any plans to work from anywhere in the entire Ross Sea quarter until Scott decided \\"what limits he puts on his own rights\\". To this Shackleton replied: \\"There is no doubt in my mind that his rights end at the base he asked for [...] I consider I have reached my limit and I go no further\\".The matter was unresolved when Scott returned from sea duty in May 1907.

The owner of the takeaway, who heard the shots, recalled the traumatic scene as Moss entered his shop screaming \\"I've been shot, I've been shot.\\" A memorial to Sabrina Moss has been set up in Kilburn, where she lost her life. The teacher was caught in a hail of bullets from both a shotgun and a machine gun when she was tragically killed. The arrests came just five days after her funeral, which was attended by hundreds of mourners. Martell Warren, 22, from north west London, has already been charged with Moss's murder and the attempted murder of Sabrina Gachette. Warren is scheduled to appear at the Old Bailey on November 19. He also faces charges for the attempted murder of the two other men who were arrested after they went to the hospital suffering from gunshot wounds."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Tweet: @Elaine_W_84 Thanks, night and sweet dreams to you too ! See you tomorrow  Predict the sentiment of this tweet.","output":"The sentiment of this tweet appears to be positive. There are a number of elements within the tweet that suggest this. First and foremost, the user is expressing gratitude by saying \\"Thanks\\". Gratitude is generally indicative of a positive sentiment as it involves expressing appreciation or being thankful to someone. Moreover, the user is also wishing \\"night and sweet dreams\\" to Elaine, whose Twitter handle is mentioned at the beginning of the tweet. This type of sentiment usually denotes a warmness or caring attitude from the sender towards the recipient, which again correlates with positive sentiment. Additionally, the phrase \\"See you tomorrow\\" suggests that the sender is looking forward to seeing Elaine in the near future, which signifies a positive emotion or attitude towards her. Last but not least, the use of exclamation marks at the end of the sentences might also be seen as an indication of a whooping, jovial or salient sentiment, which can be generally classified as positive. Therefore, based on the elements of gratitude, well-wishing, forward-looking attitude, and the use of joyous exclamation marks in the tweet, we can conclude that the sentiment of the tweet projects a positive outlook. Consequently, this tweet likely contributes to a friendly and amicable atmosphere, promoting positive relationships in the Twitter community.  It is important to note that while sentiment analysis provides a broad hint of the emotions associated with the content, it may not fully capture every nuance, as understanding emotions communicated through text is a complex task and can be subject to individual interpretations including cultural and contextual nuances."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Process: - Your thermostat senses that the room temperature has fallen below your thermostat setting - Your thermostat sends a signal to your heating system to provide heat for your home - When your oil burner is engaged, heating oil travels from the tank to the burner by way of a pump - Here the oil becomes a fine mist mixed with air - The fuel/air mixture is then injected into the burner where it is ignited in the combustion chamber - The warm air is disbursed through vents, hot water through baseboards, or by steam radiators -   Question: suppose the room has less heat happens, how will it affect less fine mist is mixed with air.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer to this question is:","output":"If the room has less heat, it means the temperature has fallen below the thermostat setting. In this situation, the thermostat will send a signal to the heating system to provide heat for the room. As a result, the oil burner will be engaged, and the heating oil will travel from the tank to the burner by way of a pump. Now, let's consider the scenario where less fine mist is mixed with air. This can happen due to various reasons like a clogged nozzle, low oil pressure, or an improperly adjusted air/fuel mixture. When there is less fine mist mixed with air, the fuel/air mixture will not be optimal, which means that the combustion process may not be as efficient as it should be. The supposed perturbation of less fine mist mixed with air will likely result in a less efficient combustion process. This inefficiency will lead to less heat being generated within the combustion chamber. Consequently, the heating system will have to work harder and longer to achieve the desired room temperature as set by the thermostat. As a direct effect of this situation, the heating system's overall efficiency will be negatively impacted, leading to more energy consumption by the system. Additionally, some of the fuel may remain unburned, depositing as soot or other residues in the chamber, thereby contributing to eventual heating system malfunctions or failures. To sum up, the perturbation of less fine mist mixed with air will have a negative effect on the heating system's efficiency and the time taken to achieve the desired room temperature. The second effect mentioned – the disbursement of warm air through vents, hot water through baseboards, or by steam radiators – would be negatively affected, as more time and energy would be required to heat the room to the thermostat's set temperature."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

First, let's look at both sides of the equation and bring all the \\"g\\" terms to one side. So, we'll add 4*g to both sides. 2. That gives us: 17*g - g + 4*g = -38084.  3. Now, let's combine the \\"g\\" terms. 17*g + 4*g equals 21*g, and since we've already accounted for the -g, so the equation becomes: 21*g - 39384 = -38084. 4. Next, to make it easier to solve for \\"g\\", we will add 39384 to both sides of the equation: 21*g = 1300. 5. Finally, we'll find the value of \\"g\\" by dividing both sides by 21: g = 1300 / 21.  6. After dividing, we get the value of \\"g\\" as approximately 61.9. So there you have it!

Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","output":"While your two questions are related, they are not inquiring about the same information. The first question is about the feasibility of successfully executing a bank robbery in 2016, whereas the second question is about the number of unsolved bank robberies on an annual basis. Here, the focus is on analyzing the possibilities and data related to bank robberies.  First, let's address the question of whether it is possible to get away with a successful bank robbery in 2016. Robbing a bank was never an easy task, but it has become even more challenging over time due to advancements in security measures, surveillance technology, and law enforcement capabilities. Although it’s not impossible, the likelihood of successfully executing a bank heist in 2016 is diminished compared to previous decades. Some reasons for the increased difficulty include: 1. Enhanced Security Measures: Banks have adopted advanced security measures such as biometric access control, bulletproof glass walls, and panic buttons for employees to quickly alert authorities. These measures make it difficult for robbers to access the bank vaults or exit the bank after the robbery.  2. Improved Surveillance Technology: In addition to security cameras, banks also employ advanced monitoring systems, such as facial recognition software and silent alarms, which can quickly notify authorities about a bank robbery in progress. Furthermore, GPS tracking devices hidden in stolen cash have helped law enforcement locate and apprehend criminals swiftly.  3. Law Enforcement Capabilities: Police departments have become more efficient at catching criminals due to the implementation of specialized response units and the utilization of intelligence-led policing. Law enforcement officers share databases and cooperate across local, state, and federal levels to identify and apprehend suspects. Despite these challenges, some bank robbers may still succeed in their attempts. However, it is important to recognize that approximately 90% of all bank robbers worldwide ultimately get caught, particularly in countries with well-funded and advanced law enforcement and security infrastructure. Now, let's tackle the second question regarding the number of unsolved bank robberies each year. It is difficult to provide an exact figure for this statistic for several reasons. First, data on unsolved bank robberies may not be consistently recorded and reported across jurisdictions. Second, what constitutes a \\"solved\\" bank robbery may also vary depending on jurisdiction and law enforcement agency criteria.  However, according to the FBI, in 2016, there were 4,251 reported bank robberies in the United States. Of those, approximately 1,000 cases, or about 23.5%, remained unsolved. Worldwide, the percentage of unsolved bank robberies may be higher, especially in countries with underfunded or ill-equipped law enforcement agencies. However, the precise figures remain uncertain. In conclusion, while the two questions you posed are related, they inquire about different aspects of bank robberies. Although successfully robbing a bank in 2016 is challenging, some incidents go unsolved each year. The advancements in bank security measures, surveillance technology, and law enforcement capabilities have contributed to the successful apprehension and conviction of a majority of bank robbers."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Solve this math problem Solve -13*z + 41*z + 448 = -4*z for z.","output":"Alright, let's solve this math problem step by step, like we're talking to a 5-year-old. We have this equation: -13 * z + 41 * z + 448 = -4 * z First, let's put all the 'z' terms on one side and move the number (448) to the other side. We have -13 * z and 41 * z on the left side. If you have -13 apples and add 41 apples, you will have 28 apples. So, it will be: 28 * z + 448 = -4 * z Now, let's move -4 * z from the right side to the left side. It will be like adding 4 * z on both sides which will look like this: 28 * z + 4 * z + 448 = 0 Now, let's add 28 * z and 4 * z together. It's like having 28 cookies and adding 4 more cookies, which makes 32 cookies. So, now we have: 32 * z + 448 = 0 Now, let's move 448 to the other side, which is like taking 448 away: 32 * z = -448 Finally, we need to figure out the value of z. We have 32 * z = -448, which means we need to see how many times 32 fits into -448. If you have -448 cookies, and you divide them into 32 equal groups, each group will have -14 cookies (because -448 divided by 32 equals -14).

Q:Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: In Ancient Greece in the land far away, when people read Greek mythology came the time of legend â the greatest son of Zeus â Hercules. Hercules was once destined to be the King of Mycenae as his father Zeus had planned but his jealous stepmother Hera had other plans. Hera not willing a bastard son of Zeus should overshadow her, decided to let another boy, Eurystheus, his cousin born first which deprived Hercules of the right. Hera tried to kill Hercules with two serpents but he strangles them both. As the years go by, Hercules displayed strength like no other boy his age which unknown to many, his father is really Zeus. Eurystheus was then declared king after winning a race. Unable to accept his defeat, Hercules challenged Eurystheus to another round which accidentally takes away the life of his mother Alcmene. Feeling guilty even with all the consolation Megara gives him, he goes to the oracle and consults Apollo who tells him he must perform the \\"Twelve Labors\\" for Eurystheus. He refuses at first until the guilt goes so deep that he gives in to the challenge. Hercules is given a series of challenges each one was designed tougher by the other by his stepmother Hera.

He started acting in 1952 and was the first sportsman to be nominated to the Rajya Sabha (upper house) of India. He worked as Hindi and Punjabi film producer, director and writer, and he acted in films and television.  - An upper house, sometimes called a Senate, is one of two chambers of a bicameral legislature (or one of three chambers of a tricameral legislature), the other chamber being the lower house. The house formally designated as the upper house is usually smaller, and often has more restricted power, than the lower house. Examples of upper houses in countries include the UK's House of Lords, Canada's Senate, India's Rajya Sabha, Russia's Federation Council, Ireland's Seanad, Germany's Bundesrat and the United States Senate.  - An actor (or actress for females; see terminology) is a person who portrays a character in a performance. The actor performs \\"in the flesh\\" in the traditional medium of the theatre, or in modern mediums such as film, radio, and television. The analogous Greek term is, literally \\"one who answers\\". The actor's interpretation of their role pertains to the role played, whether based on a real person or fictional character. Interpretation occurs even when the actor is \\"playing themselves\\", as in some forms of experimental performance art, or, more commonly; to act, is to create, a character in performance.  - Bhakti Mein Shakti is a 1978 Bollywood film directed by and starring Dara Singh .  - A politician (from \\"politics\\" + \\"-ian\\", from the Greek title of Aristotle's book  \\"Politika\\", meaning \\"Civic Affairs\\") is a person active in party politics, or a person holding or seeking office in government. In democratic countries, politicians seek elective positions within a government through elections or, at times, temporary appointment to replace politicians who have died, resigned or have been otherwise removed from office. In non-democratic countries, they employ other means of reaching power through appointment, bribery, revolutions and intrigues. Some politicians are experienced in the art or science of government. Politicians propose, support and create laws or policies that govern the land and, by extension, its people. Broadly speaking, a \\"politician\\" can be anyone who seeks to achieve political power in any bureaucratic institution.

One foggy morning,the traffic was so bad on South Street that she decided to drop him off behind the school. Andy walked for about ten minutes and got to the gate. He held the icy handle,but it didn't move!Using both hands,he tried his hardest and finally the gate opened. After Andy closed the gate behind him,he looked in the direction of the teaching building. But all he could see was fog. He got to the spot where the slide had always been,but it was not there.\\"The slide is gone!\\" he cried. He walked a little more to look for the swings,but they were not where they had always been.\\"The swings are gone!\\" he cried again. Andy kept walking. He was so anxious to see the school that he fell and landed on the ground. He still couldn't see the school. A terrible thought appeared in his head.\\"The school is gone!\\" he cried sadly.

Help as much as you can. Given the question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What did the captain from West Point do as soon as he gets to Furnace Creek? , can you please find it?   Troops are massacred at a Furnace Creek fort in 1880 after an army captain, Walsh, cites orders forcing him to abandon a wagon train. Apache Indians hid inside the wagons to gain access to the fort. General Blackwell is blamed for the incident and court-martialed. Denying that he sent any such order, the general has a stroke and dies on the witness stand. No written evidence of the order is presented. One of his sons, Rufe, a captain from West Point, travels west to find out what happened. His brother, Cash, reads of their father's death in a Kansas City newspaper and also heads toward Furnace Creek in search of answers. Using an alias, Cash learns that Capt. Walsh has become a drunkard. A mining boss, Leverett, is impressed by the stranger in town and hires him, not knowing Cash's real name or intent. Rufe arrives in town and also assumes a false identity. Cafe waitress Molly Baxter, whose father was killed at the fort, still considers General Blackwell the man to blame. But the real villain is Leverett, who bribed Walsh and organized the Apache raid. A guilty conscience causes Walsh to write a confession. Leverett sends one of his henchmen to do away with Walsh, but the confession is found by Cash. Rufe is framed, arrested and tried, but escapes. Cash gives him the confession and tells him to take it to the Army as proof. Wounded in a gunfight with Leverett but victorious, Cash recovers and reads in the paper about the proof of General Blackwell's innocence. The answer is:","output":"As soon as Rufe, the captain from West Point, gets to Furnace Creek, he assumes a false identity in order to find out what happened."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. If Aria, a 5-star hotel, is going to offer a buffet, you'd expect it to be spectacular or at least up to par. Bellagio has it, so why not Aria, right? I  came here with my family yesterday--truly DISAPPOINTED! My mom took a bite of the cold cut meat and spat it out because it had a foul taste and smell to it. I saw the meat, but didn't get it because they looked like they had been sitting there for a good while. I was going to try granola with yogurt, but it had a film on the yogurt as if it had been sitting there for a VERY LONG TIME. My first round barely filled the plate because nothing looked really fresh. I am not a picky eater or a harsh food critic, but I am not going to eat something that looks like it had been sitting there from last night. The tomato salad looked like it had been sitting there for a good while, too. Management is obviously the problem and ARIA NEEDS TO TAKE NOTE OF THIS! WHAT IS THIS PLACE TRYING TO DO? GIVE US FOOD POISONING??? C'mon!!! If your buffet selection is not great, at least make sure that your food is fresh. I was at the curry section yesterday and they didnt even bother to empty out the old curry. Instead, they just threw more fresh ones on top. The old ones on the bottom will only turn bad, it's not going to make it more fresh with the fresh ones on top. The only best section of the buffet was the dessert section. Even though options were not many, at least they looked decently fresh. Is this review positive or negative?","output":"This review is negative.

Question: Who is wounded by gunfire ? Movie title: The Terminator Movie plot: In 1984 Los Angeles, a cyborg assassin known as a Terminator arrives from the future and steals guns and clothes. Shortly afterwards, Kyle Reese, a human soldier, also arrives. He steals clothes from a homeless man and evades the police. The Terminator begins systematically killing women named Sarah Connor, whose addresses it finds in the telephone directory. It tracks the third Sarah Connor to a nightclub, but Kyle rescues her. The two steal a car and escape with the Terminator pursuing them in a police car. As they hide in a parking lot, Kyle explains to Sarah that an artificial intelligence defense network, known as Skynet, will become self-aware in the near future and initiate a nuclear holocaust. Sarah's future son John will rally the survivors and lead a resistance movement against Skynet and its army of machines. With the Resistance on the verge of victory, Skynet sent a Terminator back in time to kill Sarah before John is born, to prevent the formation of the Resistance. The Terminator is an efficient killing machine with a powerful metal endoskeleton and an external layer of living tissue that makes it appear human. Kyle and Sarah are apprehended by the police after another encounter with the Terminator. Criminal psychologist Dr. Silberman concludes that Kyle is paranoid and delusional. The Terminator repairs its body and attacks the police station, killing many police officers in its attempt to locate Sarah. Kyle and Sarah escape and take refuge in a motel, where they assemble pipe bombs and plan their next move. Kyle admits that he has been in love with Sarah since John gave him a photograph of her, and they have sex. The Terminator discovers their location, and they attempt to escape in a pickup truck.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: With the growth of the Internet and the ease of publishing content, more and more creative minds are coming online to share videos, music, software, products, services, opinions, and more. While the technology has empowered a generation to build new audiences and share interesting things, an unfortunate side-effect has been a culture in which some consumers of this content have provided feedback in a form that is personalized, mean-spirited, disrespectful, and in some cases, malicious. We have all seen it…the trolls, the haters, the comment boxes filled with venom and vitriol, typically pointed at people just trying to do good and interesting things. Unfortunately, this conduct can be jarring for many people, with some going as far to give up sharing their creative endeavours so as not to deal with the “wrath of the Internet”. As some of you will know, this has been bothering me for a while now. While there is no silver bullet for solving these issues, one thing I have learned over the years is how to put negative, anti-social, and non-constructive comments and feedback into perspective. To help others with this I have written a free book called Dealing With Disrespect. Dealing With Disrespect is a short, simple to read, free book that provides a straight-forward guide for handling this kind of challenging feedback, picking out the legitimate criticism to learn from, and how to not just ignore the haters, but how to manage them. The book helps put all communication, whether on or offline, into perspective and helps you to become a better communicator yourself. My goal with the book is that when someone reads something anti-social that demotivates them, a friend can recommend ‘Dealing With Disrespect’ as something that can help put things in perspective. Question: What happened before the book Dealing With Disrespect was written? Options: - the Internet trolls, the haters, the comment boxes filled with venom - publishing content - the new generation of technology - not enough information Answer:","output":"the Internet trolls, the haters, the comment boxes filled with venom"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Scientists are finding evidence that gum chewing may be good for your health. It may even help improve your test scores. This exciting research is just beginning. And in the meantime, companies are also experimenting with adding vitamins, minerals, medicines, and other substances that could give gum the power to cure headaches and fight everything from serious diseases to bad breath. Other researchers are finding that gum might work better than a pill to deliver medicines and other substances into the bloodstream. That's because the lining   of our cheeks can absorb certain substances more quickly than our stomachs and intestines   can. That discovery could help other researchers develop medicine-containing gums that fight colds, ease headaches, battle nervousness, and more. Scientists might even create antimicrobial   gums that cure bad breath. Those projects may take years, but gum scientists have already had at least one recent success: They've created a gum that could help us stay awake. Researchers have produced a gum called Stay Alert. Each stick has as much caffeine as a cup of coffee. It can take an hour for the caffeine in coffee to have its full effect, but the caffeine in Stay Alert _ in just a few minutes. The gum is easy to transport and it's stable in cold and hot climates. Unlike a pill, it doesn't require water to swallow. Those qualities make it easy for soldiers to use.

Each vehicle's measurement will be different, though most are generally somewhere between 0.028-.06 inch. You can either look in your owner's manual or go to the auto parts store and have them look it up for you.

There are several varieties of tools used to measure the gaps of spark plugs, some of which are more appropriate for more modern plugs, which sometimes feature delicate precious metals. Most measuring tools will also feature a flat edge typically used for bending the bottom electrode on the spark plug to adjust the gap slightly.  A coin-style gap measure is usually the cheapest option, and works by running the edge of the \\"coin\\" through the gap until you reach a point where it stops. The edge is marked like a ruler, designating the thickness of the edge at that point. This is a good tool for older plugs you want to check the efficacy of, but can also inadvertently widen the gaps as you use it. A wire coin gap works essentially the same way as the regular coin-style gap, but features different wire measures of varying lengths on the edge around the coin. A blade-style feeler gauge is an effective and versatile tool. Built like a pocket-knife, this gauge features different blades of varying widths, some with wire on the end and some without, placed in the gap to check the spacing of the electrodes. You can also use multiple blades to measure larger gaps. These are effective to use while adjusting. . If you've just pulled it out of the box, it should be in pretty good shape, but if you're checking a plug that you've been using in your car it's a good idea to clean it off a little with a clean cloth. Spark plugs can build up some whitish soot on the contact points, so you'll want to make sure they're somewhat clean to get the most accurate reading. You can use a little bit of quick-drying (90%) alcohol on the contact points to clean them off if they're especially dirty. Lots of build-up or any blackening on the contact points might be a sign of a plug that's outlasted its prime, however. If they're especially dirty, you might consider buying new ones. Place the appropriate blade or wire on your gap tool between the electrode tips of the plug, or pass the coin through the electrodes to determine the measurement.","output":"To check the gap between the two electrodes on spark plugs, first determine the appropriate gap for your vehicle, which is usually between 0.028-0.06 inch. You can find this in your owner's manual or consult an auto parts store. Modified engines typically require smaller gaps. Various tools are available for measuring spark plug gaps, such as coin-style, wire coin, and blade-style feeler gauges. When checking spark plugs, clean them with a clean cloth and, if needed, quick-drying (90%) alcohol to ensure an accurate reading. Blackened or excessively dirty contact points might indicate that a plug needs replacement. To measure the gap, place the appropriate blade or wire on the tool between the electrodes or pass the coin through them."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Grande dame of cooking still going strong at 90: Julia Child celebrates in San Francisco. How does it feel to turn 90 and have attained the status of an icon, a living legend? \\"It feels just like it felt before,\\" Julia Child says with the throaty laugh familiar to millions who cut their culinary teeth on her \\"French Chef\\" television series. The show, along with her seminal book, \\"Mastering the Art of French Cooking\\" (1961), revolutionized the way America cooks and eats. While making light of the difference a day -- or another decade -- makes, Child intends to enjoy her birthday thoroughly. First, there will be all the public observances, including a sold-out dinner Thursday at San Francisco's tony Fifth Floor restaurant, which -- like dinners that night at 19 other venues across the country -- will benefit the scholarship fund of the International Association of Culinary Professionals (which Child co-founded). Friday to Sunday, the action moves to Napa, with both members-only and public events at COPIA: The American Center for Wine, Food and the Arts, of which she is an honorary board member. Aug. 15, her actual birthday, will see her in Maine at an annual gathering of nieces, nephews, their offspring and friends, who for many years have rolled a joined birthday celebration for several members of the group into a jolly reunion. The schedule Child and her assistant of 14 years, former pastry chef Stephanie Hersh, have laid out is not exactly a senior-citizen routine, even though Child has always been candid about her age and realistic in assessing her own capabilities. When the Pasadena native moved back to California from her long-time home in the Boston area last year, she also made the move from a condominium she and her late husband, Paul, had purchased many years ago to a progressive retirement home. She is in the most active of the four levels available, but should the need arise, she can move on to assisted living facilities within the same complex.  Do you have any questions?","output":"Yes, I have a few questions: 1. What specific events are planned for the public celebrations of Julia Child's birthday, both in San Francisco and at COPIA? 2.

On March 10, in Beijing, Shikai was sworn in as the second Provisional President of the Republic of China.\\",  answer the following question. Note that the answer is present within the text.  Question: Who would be responsible for negotiating with world leaders on trade matters? Answer:","output":"Yuan Shikai, as the second Provisional President of the Republic of China, would be responsible for negotiating with world leaders on trade matters."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. The second major point on which the principals had agreed on March 10 was the need to crack down on terrorist organizations and curtail their fund-raising. The embassy bombings of 1998 had focused attention on al Qaeda's finances. One result had been the creation of an NSC-led interagency committee on terrorist financing. On its recommendation, the President had designated  Bin Laden and al Qaeda as subject to sanctions under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. This gave theTreasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) the ability to search for and freeze any  Bin Laden or al Qaeda assets that reached the U.S. financial system. But since OFAC had little information to go on, few funds were frozen. In July 1999, the President applied the same designation to the Taliban for harboring  Bin Laden. Here, OFAC had more success. It blocked more than 34 million in Taliban assets held in U.S. banks. Another 215 million in gold and 2 million in demand deposits, all belonging to the Afghan central bank and held by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, were also frozen. After October 1999, when the State Department formally designated al Qaeda a \\"foreign terrorist organization,\\" it became the duty of U.S. banks to block its transactions and seize its funds. Neither this designation nor UN sanctions had much additional practical effect; the sanctions were easily circumvented, and there were no multilateral mechanisms to ensure that other countries' financial systems were not used as conduits for terrorist funding. Attacking the funds of an institution, even the Taliban, was easier than finding and seizing the funds of a clandestine worldwide organization like al Qaeda. Although the CIA's  Bin Laden unit had originally been inspired by the idea of studying terrorist financial links, few personnel assigned to it had any experience in financial investigations. Any terrorist-financing intelligence appeared to have been collected collaterally, as a consequence of gathering other intelligence. This attitude may have stemmed in large part from the chief of this unit, who did not believe that simply following the money from point A to point B revealed much about the terrorists' plans and intentions. As a result, the CIA placed little emphasis on terrorist financing. Nevertheless, the CIA obtained a general understanding of how al Qaeda raised money.  Question: \\"What are two reasons the CIA placed little emphasis on terrorist financing?\\" Response: \\"The chief of the CIA's  Bin Laden unit did not believe that tracing money from point A to point B revealed much about the terrorists' plans and intentions, and few personnel assigned to the unit had any experience in financial investigations\\" Does the response correctly answer the question?","output":"Yes, the response correctly answers the question by providing two reasons: the chief's belief about tracing money and the lack of experience in financial investigations among the personnel. However, I'll explain it in simpler terms for better understanding: The CIA didn't focus much on how terrorists got their money because: 1. The boss of the team studying terrorists thought that following the money didn't tell them much about the terrorists' plans. 2. The people working on that team didn't know much about investigating money issues."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Monday #39;s triumphant second flight of SpaceShipOne is a perfect example of private business taking up where government left off and improving an idea.","output":"The successful second flight of SpaceShipOne symbolizes a significant shift in the realm of space exploration and access to space. Traditionally, government agencies such as NASA and the European Space Agency have been the dominant forces working towards propelling mankind into the cosmos. However, SpaceShipOne's triumphant flight represents the potential of private enterprises to innovate and streamline technology and operations in the latter area, ultimately expanding possibilities for human life beyond Earth. SpaceShipOne, designed by aerospace engineer Burt Rutan and backed by billionaire investor Paul Allen, made history by becoming the first privately funded, piloted spacecraft to reach the boundary of space in 2004. It paved the way for the private sector's involvement in space exploration activities as well as encouraging commercialization of access to space. This historic event led to the formation of companies such as SpaceX and Blue Origin, each bringing forth their unique approaches and technologies in their attempt to make space travel more accessible and affordable. SpaceShipOne's achievements and the subsequent growth of various private aerospace companies have demonstrated that the private sector can complement government-led efforts, challenge conventional norms, and foster new advancements in spacecraft design, technology, and mission execution. This collaboration effectively creates a competitive environment, pushing both government and private entities to innovate and push the boundaries in several aspects. Firstly, one of the most significant benefits of privatization in space exploration is the efficiency of resource allocation. Government-funded programs often face budgetary constraints, bureaucracy, and long developmental timelines. Private organizations, on the other hand, maintain more flexible operational models, make rapid decisions, and optimize resources and funding to achieve their objectives due to their competitive nature in the market. Secondly, private enterprises bring forth a spirit of entrepreneurship in the realm of space exploration. Fueled by ambition, visionaries such as Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos utilize their financial muscle and expertise to drive efforts in creating sustainable and reusable space vehicles. Such initiatives lower the costs associated with space access and transportation, allowing commercial customers, scientists, and perhaps even ordinary citizens the opportunity to venture into space. Thirdly, the collaboration between private and public sectors in space endeavors facilitates diversification in the types of missions planned and executed. While government agencies primarily focus on research, exploration, and national security objectives, private enterprises can expand the scope to developing space tourism, asteroid mining, and satellite servicing. This diversification of goals within the industry helps to establish a more extensive range of services and revenue streams for the overall development of space technology and infrastructure. In conclusion, SpaceShipOne's triumphant second flight not only marked a historic moment in human spaceflight history but also exemplified the potential of private businesses to supplement government endeavors and improve upon existing ideas and technologies. With the involvement of the private sector, space exploration and access are poised to undergo a revolutionary transformation, driving innovation and expanding the boundaries of what is possible for the future of humanity in space."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: Holston River joins up at Knoxville with which river that begins in Transylvania County, North Carolina? The answer to this question is:","output":"The river that begins in Transylvania County, North Carolina, and joins up with the Holston River at Knoxville is the French Broad River. The French Broad River plays a significant role in the geography and landscape of North Carolina and Tennessee. The French Broad River has its origins in the Southern Appalachian Mountains of North Carolina, particularly in the county of Transylvania. The river is approximately 218 miles (350 km) long and flows westward across the Blue Ridge Mountains, offering stunning views of the surrounding landscape. As it flows through North Carolina, it passes through cities like Asheville, Biltmore, and Marshall, all of which have embraced their connection to the river and its contributions to the local environment and tourism. The river continues its journey through the Great Smoky Mountains and into Tennessee. The French Broad River is important not only for its geographical size but also for its role in shaping the ecology, culture, and history of the regions it traverses. As it flows into Tennessee, it passes through a variety of different landscapes – from mountainous regions to low-lying plains – providing a diverse array of habitats for native plant and animal species. Upon reaching Knoxville, Tennessee, the French Broad River merges with the Holston River, resulting in the formation of the Tennessee River. This confluence is considered as significant both geographically and historically since it serves as the primary source of water for millions of people living in the Tennessee Valley. The French Broad River's presence in Transylvania County, North Carolina, and its meeting with Holston River at Knoxville, Tennessee, showcases the beauty and importance of the American river system in shaping the lives and development of the communities along its path."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Asked & Answered | Sean Patrick Maylone With K-pop groups like the Wonder Girls on the ascent — and sitting front row at the Chloé show in Shanghai — it’s clear that Korean pop is having a moment. But is there a Korean underground? According to Sean Patrick Maylone, the answer is yes. His Seoul-based booking and promotion agency, SuperColorSuper, has helped to create a South Korean tour circuit for indie bands like Caribou, Das Racist and CocoRosie, blazing a trail not just to Seoul, but also to Busan and Daegu, places the 30-year-old native Californian knew nothing about when he arrived in Korea to teach English four years ago. Here, Maylone discusses South Korea’s burgeoning underground music scene. Indie bands have long played Tokyo, Shanghai and Beijing. Why has it taken so long for South Korea to become a tour stop? That’s basically what I asked myself when I first started doing this. There’s a lot of money here. People spend it on iPhones and entertainment and gadgets. Getting bands here shouldn’t be so hard. I mean, we’re right next to Tokyo, which has what seems like 60,000 shows every night. I don’t know the cause of the oversight, but all of my work is aimed at trying to correct it. How is the economics of booking bands changing there? Now that we’re finding the underground community, we can rely on the fact that we can bring in enough fans to cover costs. One limitation for all of Asia has been gear. Some bigger bands need their own gear, and they have to put it on a ship, which can be really expensive. We now have local gear rental and are trying to make all this local source stuff work in order to fix that. That’s one reason we are working on a tour network. Doing shows in some small Korean cities helps generate money to pay off the flights to get into Korea. I also work with D.I.Y. promoters in Hong Kong and the Philippines to make these larger Asian tours more financially feasible for the artists. How receptive are Korean audiences to your shows? We have a lot of expats who come to the shows, but it’s getting more Korean lately. Initially, I think the Korean crowd saw our shows as “foreigner” shows, because these bands have a lot of expat fans. By hosting bands that have a larger Korean fan base, we’ve grabbed more Koreans’ eyes. What do you see happening in Korea’s music world? I think Korea’s coming into what we in America experienced in the 1950s and ’60s, socially and artistically, and that we’re going to see the rise of more anti-heroes. Something like “Rebel Without a Cause” is going to come out here, or their own hippie movement. Maybe K-pop is going to go through stages like the Beatles did, from straight-up bubblegum to more tripped-out, experimental open-mindedness. It’s related to economics. Korea was having problems in the ’90s. People were having trouble just putting food on their plates. They had a militant government. Now people have all this money to spend. You have the rise of an artist class, and creative explosions are going to follow. People in various industries are sort of betting on it. Vice magazine has gotten involved with music here. Nylon now does a Korean version. I’m hoping we’ll start to feel the development of a Korean signature, a Korean approach to things. Does SuperColorSuper work with Korean bands? Yeah, part of what we do is inform local bands about D.I.Y. touring — how to connect with established bands, drive city to city, live cheaply, sleep at people’s houses and build a following. We’ve also sent some Korean bands to China. One of the projects we’re doing now is making these viral art videos to help launch Korean bands so that people outside of Korea can check them out. For Korean underground music to thrive, there has to be circulation: bands going outside of Korea, bands moving between cities in Korea. What are some Korean bands people should check out? A noise-pop duo called (((10))), comprised of a girl and a guy that have a sort of early Animal Collective sound. Wagwak, a catchy, Bright Eyes-type indie folk duo. Vidulgi Ooyoo, a shoe-gaze band reminiscent of My Bloody Valentine or Slowdive whose name translates to “Pigeon Milk.” Bamseom Pirates, a funny grind-core band who play 30-second songs. A chill-wave band called Googolplex. Yamagata Tweakster is a tongue-in-cheek solo artist who dresses in slacks and a tie and sings and dances with his laptop. There’s not a lot of Korean irony, but there are a few bands that have just come out that are using irony pretty well. The band Ninano Nanda combines Korean pansori operatic singing with really ’90s techno-beats and Mortal Kombat soundtrack-type sounds. What are Korean clubs like? There are these generic halls where you can do your music-award show or whatever. They don’t have much of a flavor, no specific design or genre they focus on, which is good because it means many types of people can use them for different events. We use them for bigger acts. Then there are these dirty little rock clubs like the ones back home. There’s one called DGBD that’s built to look like the inside of CBGB. They bill hard rock and punk. Many of them are in one neighborhood, and that neighborhood’s going through a lot of changes. Is that Hongdae, the university district? Yeah, Hongdae. There are a bunch of university neighborhoods, but Hongdae is where all of this stuff is centered. There’s also an area called Gangnam where all the head-banger and electronic bands play, but the clubs there charge like 40 to get in. Gangnam is more the high-money dance scene. Hongdae is the live-music scene. You’ve played in your own noise pop band, Ssighborgggg, for a number of years. Has being in a touring band made you a better promoter? SuperColorSuper puts a lot of thought into everything. We’re known for having great art and great posters. I’m all about making a show as artistic and visual an environment as possible.

Attaining the rank of \\"Venerable\\" within the Catholic Church signifies that the person has reached a significant milestone on the path to sainthood. The process of canonization in the Catholic Church is a lengthy and rigorous one, involving multiple stages, and being declared Venerable is a testament to the candidate's exemplary life, virtues, and contributions to the faith. The journey towards sainthood begins with the candidate being at least five years removed from their death. This waiting period ensures that the individual's life and deeds can be objectively assessed. Once the waiting period has elapsed, the local bishop may open an investigation into the candidate's life. They gather information, testimonies, and documentation about the person's virtues, holiness, and reputation. At this stage, the candidate is often referred to as a \\"Servant of God.\\" Once the local investigation has been completed, its findings are submitted to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints in Rome. If the Vatican believes that there is enough substantiated evidence to move forward, the Pope may declare the person to be \\"Venerable.\\" This title affirms that the candidate lived a life of \\"heroic virtue\\" and that they are a worthy example for others to follow. The Venerable designation is a significant step forward, as it allows for the continuation of the cause toward beatification (the declaration of being “Blessed”) and ultimately canonization (sainthood). Naturally, this is an enormous accomplishment and a source of pride for believers who support the candidate's cause. The recognition as Venerable serves to strengthen and inspire the faithful. It also reinforces the candidate's contributions to the Church and increases the prospect of their cause ultimately advancing to beatification and canonization. Thus, the rank of \\"Venerable\\" is truly an important milestone and an impressive achievement in the journey toward sainthood."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Here is a question about this article: The domestication of poultry took place several thousand years ago. This may have originally been as a result of people hatching and rearing young birds from eggs collected from the wild, but later involved keeping the birds permanently in captivity. Domesticated chickens may have been used for cockfighting at first and quail kept for their songs, but soon it was realised how useful it was having a captive-bred source of food. Selective breeding for fast growth, egg-laying ability, conformation, plumage and docility took place over the centuries, and modern breeds often look very different from their wild ancestors. Although some birds are still kept in small flocks in extensive systems, most birds available in the market today are reared in intensive commercial enterprises. Poultry is the second most widely eaten type of meat globally and, along with eggs, provides nutritionally beneficial food containing high-quality protein accompanied by a low proportion of fat. All poultry meat should be properly handled and sufficiently cooked in order to reduce the risk of food poisoning. What is the answer to this question: Has breeding changed the original characterictics of the animals ?","output":"Yes, breeding has significantly changed the original characteristics of the animals, particularly in the context of poultry. The domestication of poultry began several thousand years ago and has evolved considerably since then. The practice of selective breeding has played a pivotal role in altering the characteristics of these birds to meet specific human needs and preferences. Over the centuries, selective breeding has focused on traits such as fast growth, egg-laying ability, conformation, plumage, and docility. As a result, modern poultry breeds often exhibit substantial differences from their wild ancestors in both appearance and behavior. These changes have been brought about deliberately in order to enhance productivity and better serve human requirements for meat, eggs, and other purposes. For instance, chickens have been bred for higher growth rates, larger body size, and increased meat yield compared to their wild counterparts. Additionally, egg-laying breeds have been selectively bred for higher egg production, larger egg size, and more consistent egg-laying patterns. These changes in physical attributes and productivity have led to an extensive variety of specialized poultry breeds that are kept for meat and egg production, as well as ornamental purposes. Moreover, selective breeding has also led to the development of birds with a more docile temperament, which makes them more suitable for captive rearing and easier to handle and manage. This behavioral adaptation has allowed for the expansion of intensive commercial poultry farming enterprises, which rely on large numbers of birds kept in confined spaces. In conclusion, breeding has indeed changed the original characteristics of the animals, particularly poultry, to align with the diverse needs and preferences of humans. These changes have resulted in the wide variety of modern poultry breeds that differ significantly from their wild ancestors in terms of appearance, productivity, and behavior. While these alterations have led to more efficient meat and egg production, it is crucial to ensure proper handling and cooking practices to reduce the risk of food poisoning and maintain the nutritional benefits of poultry products."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Death of DUI suspect found hanging in cell ruled a suicide A 28-year-old drunken driving suspect found hanging from his t-shirt in an NYPD holding cell killed himself, the city medical examiner ruled.

Write a title for this article: The documents show that he claimed to still be worth millions of dollars even as he struggled to remain relevant while his al Qaeda network splintered. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence released the newly declassified documents Tuesday. They were recovered during the May 2011 raid on bin Laden's compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, in which he was killed. In it, bin Laden said that he had 29 million in Sudan that he wished to be used on \\"jihad for the sake of Allah,\\" while also directing a small portion of that figure to various family members. The whereabouts of the money are unknown. And in a separate letter, from 2008, he wrote, \\"If I am to be killed, pray for me a lot and give continuous charities in my name.\\" Bin Laden's media savvy was also on display. In an undated letter where he wrote about the upcoming 10th anniversary of the September 11 attacks, he sought something of a media blitz to highlight his belief that the attacks were the precursor to the global financial crisis of the late 2000s. He recommended that his lieutenants reach out to CBS, other unnamed American networks and the Islamabad bureau chief of Al Jazeera to pitch some type of anniversary special, recommending Robert Fisk, a journalist who had previously interviewed him, to moderate. RELATED: The Osama bin Laden documents The financial hardships of al Qaeda also come through in the documents, with bin Laden suggesting a scheme that would extort money from other countries, Mauritania among them, in exchange for a promise from al Qaeda not to attack them in the future. Bin Laden did express concern about attacking Iran and Turkey, however, because much of al Qaeda's money traveled through those countries on its way to members of the organization. Interestingly, bin Laden also appears to have considered moving from Abbottabad in January 2011, some five months before his eventual death, but apparently not because he believed he was being tracked. And there were also apparent differences with the current ISIS philosophy of establishing a caliphate as a base of operations. Bin Laden was reluctant to pursue a caliphate because of the difficulty in garnering popular support for it, along with the day-to-day burden of governing. But his concerns were often more mundane, concerning the education of certain relatives and medical treatment of others. In a letter dated less than three months before his death, bin Laden wrote that he preferred a female relative to visit a female doctor to describe an unidentified set of symptoms and said an x-ray or ultrasound should be obtained if the symptoms persisted. In another letter, bin Laden expressed his gratitude that a brother of his was able to visit a dentist -- something the most-hunted man in the world was unable to do. Bin Laden also feared that one of his wives might have been implanted with a small tracking device in her tooth during a visit to a dentist in Iran, telling her, \\"The size of the chip is about the length of a grain of wheat and the width of a fine piece of vermicelli.\\" The letters show Bin Laden to be paranoid regarding spy agencies tracking his movements, advising his subordinates to only travel on overcast days to avoid aerial surveillance and to dispose of suitcases that had been used to move money due to fears that the bags might contain tracking chips. The more than 100 documents put out Tuesday are the second tranche to be released by the intelligence community and follow a rigorous interagency review process to determine which documents are ready for release to the public after being declassified and translated from Arabic. \\"It's important that the documents collected at bin Laden's compound be made available to the public,\\" Brian Hale, director of public affairs for the Director of National Intelligence said in a press release accompanying the documents. \\"This was no easy feat as members of the task force dedicated themselves over a long period of time,\\" he said. RELATED: Secrets of the bin Laden treasure-trove The latest documents also shine a light on bin Laden's concern over a growing divide between al Qaeda and its affiliates and his efforts to present the terror network as a unified organization. In a letter to the people of Libya, bin Laden praised the overthrow of the \\"tyrant\\" Moammar Gadhafi but called for the country to unite under the banner of Islamic law, while warning the United States and other countries to stay out of Libya. And in a different letter addressed to \\"Muslim brothers and sisters,\\" bin Laden wrote of the importance of avoiding indiscriminate Muslim deaths in jihadi operations and urged jihadis to be judicious in their use of human shields during operations. He also wrote directly to the American people, telling them after President Barack Obama assumed office that attacks against the United States would persist as long as America supported Israel. The intelligence community expects to release additional documents from the raid later this year after they have been declassified.","output":"Declassified Documents Reveal Bin Laden's Desperation to Maintain Wealth and Relevance Amid Growing Al Qaeda Fragmentation"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Registration fees for Illinois lawyers could jump as much as 49 a year if lawmakers adopt two separate measures to bolster pro-bono services and support for lawyers with drug and alcohol problems. The Illinois Supreme Court is pushing for legislation that would allow it to dedicate money raised through the fee hikes to legal services to the poor. The justices are floating a 42 increase to shore up financing for pro-bono work, as the normal funding mechanism for legal services has fallen short in recent years. Currently, support for non-profit legal aid groups comes from interest generated on the Lawyers' Trust Fund, which pools clients' money that attorneys hold for such matters as escrow funds. But low interest rates and a sagging economy mean there is less money being generated. After hours of discussion, the high court agreed that raising the registration fees would be the best way to address the declining revenues, Chief Justice Moses W. Harrison II said. The judges were reluctant to raise those fees but eventually decided that supporting probono services was important enough \\"and lawyers had a responsibility to contribute\\" to the cause, Harrison said. Last year, the high court raised the base fee for active attorneys to 180 from 140. Lawyers in their first three years of practice or who are inactive pay 90, and retired lawyers pay nothing. Legislation circulated by the high court's lobbyist specifies that the hike would apply to attorneys \\"paying full annual registration fees.\\" In 2001, there were 57,392 active attorneys in Illinois and 74,311 on the full roll, according to the Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission. The hike would raise roughly 2.4 million. Last year, interest on the trust fund totaled 4.5 million, but service and handling fees consumed 538,000 of that amount. This year's returns are projected to be anywhere between 700,000 and 1 million short of that mark, said Ruth Ann Schmitt, the executive director of Lawyers Trust Fund of Illinois. Harrison said the fee hikes are designed only to counter the shortfall in interest income, not add to the total amount available. \\"Our legal services are already stretched to the breaking point,\\" Schmitt said. \\"We have a tough time raising enough money to properly fund services that our clients need.\\" Neither the Illinois State Bar Association nor The Chicago Bar Association has taken a stance on the proposed hikes.  After reading the above, is \\"Services to judges' families, services to the poor, services to military\\" the correct answer to the question \\"Name three things these funds support.\\"? Select from: + no + yes","output":"+ no The funds mentioned in the passage are for supporting pro-bono services and support for lawyers with drug and alcohol problems, not services to judges' families or services to the military.

Her paternal grandfather was of German ancestry and her paternal grandmother was of English, Welsh, French, Irish, and Dutch descent, while her maternal grandfather was of Swiss-German descent and her maternal grandmother of Swedish ancestry. Pfeiffer chose to begin the process of dissolving her film production company, Via Rosa Productions, in 1999, and move into semi-retirement in order to spend more quality time with her children and family, meaning that she would continue to star in films sporadically into the 2000s and beyond. Pfeiffer handed her producing partner Guinzburg one final film to produce under the Via Rosa Productions header. The film was called Original Sin (2001). It was originally intended to star Pfeiffer, who later changed her mind as she was looking to work less for a while. The film was produced by her company, but instead starred Angelina Jolie and Antonio Banderas.  In the Hitchcockian thriller What Lies Beneath (2000), Pfeiffer and Harrison Ford starred as a well-to-do couple who experience a strange haunting that uncovers secrets about their past. While critical response towards the film was mixed, it opened atop at the box office in July 2000, and went on to gross US291 million worldwide. She then accepted the role of Rita Harrison, a highly strung lawyer helping a father with a developmental disability, in the drama I Am Sam (2001), opposite Sean Penn. Despite grossing 97.8 million worldwide, the movie received unfavorable reviews; Seattle Post-Intelligencer wrote: \\"Pfeiffer, apparently stymied by the bland cliches that prop up her screechy role, delivers her flattest, phoniest performance ever\\". Meanwhile, SF Gate observed: \\"In one scene, she breaks down in tears as she unburdens herself to him about her miserable life. It's hard not to cringe, watching this emotionally ready actress fling herself headlong into false material\\".  Pfeiffer took on the role of a murderous artist named Ingrid Magnussen in the drama White Oleander (2002), alongside Alison Lohman (in her film debut), Renee Zellweger and Robin Wright. The film was an arthouse success and Pfeiffer garnered a substantial amount of critical praise; Stephen Holden of The New York Times wrote that \\"Ms. Pfeiffer, giving the most complex screen performance of her career, makes her Olympian seductress at once irresistible and diabolical\\". Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times described her as \\"incandescent,\\" bringing \\"power and unshakable will to her role as mother-master manipulator\\" in a \\"riveting, impeccable performance\\". She earned Best Supporting Actress Awards from the San Diego Film Critics Society and the Kansas City Film Critics Circle, as well as a Screen Actors Guild Award nomination.  Pfeiffer lent her voice for the character of goddess of chaos Eris in Sinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas (2003), an animated film featuring Brad Pitt as the voice of Sinbad the Sailor. She had struggles with finding the character's villainies. Initially the character was \\"too sexual,\\" then she lacked fun. After the third rewrite, Pfeiffer called producer Jeffrey Katzenberg and told him \\"You know, you really can fire me\\", but he assured her that this was just part of the process. Following the release of the film, she took a four-year hiatus from acting, during which she remained largely out of the public eye to devote time to her husband and children. At the time, she turned down the role of the White Witch in the fantasy film The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe (2005), which went to Tilda Swinton. Did she ever come back after her hiatus?","output":"Yes, Michelle Pfeiffer did come back after her four-year hiatus. In 2007, she made a return to the big screen by appearing in a few notable films. She starred alongside Robert De Niro, Claire Danes, and Charlie Cox in the fantasy film \\"Stardust,\\" where she played the role of an evil witch, Lamia. The movie received positive reviews from critics and was praised for its visuals and performances, including Pfeiffer's. In the same year, she also starred in the film adaptation of the Broadway musical \\"Hairspray\\" as Velma Von Tussle, alongside John Travolta, Christopher Walken, and Queen Latifah. The movie was a commercial and critical success, receiving favorable reviews for its energetic vibe and the actors' performances. Pfeiffer was recognized for her portrayal of the villainous character, showcasing her versatility as an actress. Throughout the 2010s, Pfeiffer continued taking on various roles in films like \\"Chéri\\" (2009), \\"Dark Shadows\\" (2012), \\"The Family\\" (2013), \\"Mother!\\" (2017), and \\"Murder on the Orient Express\\" (2017). She also joined the Marvel Cinematic Universe, portraying Janet van Dyne in \\"Ant-Man and the Wasp\\" (2018) and reprising her role in \\"Avengers: Endgame\\" (2019). Pfeiffer's career resurgence demonstrates her commitment to balancing family life with a successful acting career, proving that she can continue to captivate audiences with her performances even after taking a hiatus."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Article: Elderly women who eat foods higher in potassium   are less likely to have strokes and die than women who eat less potassium-rich foods, according to new research in the American Heart Association. \\"Previous studies have shown that potassium consumption may lower blood pressure. But whether potassium intake could prevent stroke   or death wasn't clear,\\" said Smoller, professor of the department of population health at Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Bronx, NY.  Researchers studied 90,137 women, aged from 50 to 79 for an average 11 years. They looked at how much potassium the women consumed, as well as if they had strokes, including ischemic strokes  , or died during the study period. Women in the study were stroke-free at the start and their average dietary potassium intake was 2,611 mg/day. Results of this study are based on potassium from food, not supplements. The researchers found: Women who ate the most potassium were 12 percent less likely to suffer stroke in general and 16 percent less likely to suffer an ischemic stroke than women who ate the least. Women who ate the most potassium were 10 percent less likely to die than those who ate the least. Among women who did not have high blood pressure, those who ate the most potassium had a 27 percent lower ischemic stroke risk and 21 perc ent reduced risk for all stroke types, compared to women who ate the least potassium in their daily diets. Among women with high blood pressure, those who ate the most potassium had a lower risk of death, but potassium intake did not lower their stroke risk.  \\"Our findings suggest that women need to eat more p otassium-rich foods.

Police have interviewed a doctor jailed for 22 years for abusing 18 children with cancer or grave blood disorders and asked him for advice on how to protect children from paedophiles, it was revealed today. In December paediatrician Myles Bradbury, 41, was found guilty of ‘gross and grotesque’ abuse of patients and having a cache of 16,000 indecent images of children at home. Bradbury exploited his job as a respected child doctor to target boys and would abuse them behind screens, sometimes with their parents in the room. Jailed: Doctor Myles Bradbury (left, outside court; and right, in his police mugshot), who abused 18 sick boys, was sent to prison for 22 years. Police have interviewed him to learn about catching paedophiles. But he is now advising police on child protection after authorities visited him in prison to learn how to avoid cases like his own, The Daily Mirror reported. Cambridgeshire Police said the prison visit was 'an attempt to gain further information from Bradbury that might help prevent it in future', adding that 'some information was given'. The revelation he is assisting police comes amid claims Bradbury has more unidentified victims, and while a NHS probe into his crimes at Cambridge's Addenbrooke's Hospital is being conducted. He was arrested in November 2013 only after the grandmother of a victim complained to the hospital. About 800 more families were told their children could have been at risk during the five years he worked for the hospital. But the shocking total includes patients he saw at two other hospitals – in Colchester and Ipswich – where he held outpatient clinics between 2008 and 2013. Police found more than 16,000 indecent images of children on a disc in Bradbury’s home. In one case he filmed the vile abuse. In the wake of his guilty plea, Addenbrooke’s launched a helpline and began contacting the families of all patients he was thought to have dealt with. Gadget: A spy pen used by Bradbury to film some of his victims as he carried out examinations on them. About 800 families were told their children could have been at risk during the five years Bradbury spent working at Addenbrooke's Hospital (pictured) in Cambridge. Police believe Bradbury targeted the boys – all of whom were ‘really poorly’ and vulnerable – in his private consulting room. Cambridge Crown Court was told that many of Bradbury's victims would be isolated from their parents and asked to remove their clothes before the doctor would grope their genitals. The depth of the examinations were often increased to meet Bradbury's sexual needs, not any medical requirement, the court heard. One said in a statement read to the court: 'I am now anxious to go to the doctor because I don’t know who I should trust. 'I have haemophilia and a pain in my side so I know I should go but I feel disgusted and weird. I didn’t think it would happen to me and I feel angry every time I think about it but also relieved it wasn’t just me but we shouldn’t have to go through it.' Another said he had regular nightmares, felt stressed and lacked confidence. 'I’d like to see Myles Bradbury and ask him why he did what he did to me,' he added. He would tell their parents they should leave the room in case their children got embarrassed, before sexually touching them for his own gratification and telling them it was a ‘legitimate examination’. As he left court after being sentenced, Bradbury said: ‘I’m so sorry’ and refused to answer further questions. Detective Superintendent Gary Ridgway said: ‘This man very cleverly and determinedly created an environment where he not only abused young people, but almost groomed colleagues and parents by being helpful – for example, seeing people outside normal consultancy hours. ‘He would see young people who were really poorly in his own consulting room and create opportunities where he was alone with them. ‘What makes this case particularly distressing is he was very plausible so he would say to young people that they needed an intimate examination. I wasn’t a case of “Don’t tell your parents”. He was putting a veneer of respectability on what he was doing and saying it was a legitimate examination.’ Mr Ridgway said there could be many other victims – including some who don’t even realise they were abused. Sentencing: Judge Gareth Hawkesworth (pictured right in this court sketch) described Bradbury (left) as 'manipulative' and said his actions had undermined the public's trust in the 'overstretched health service' What are the important parts of this article?","output":"The important parts of this article include the following: 1.

A nightclub is generally distinguished from regular bars, pubs or taverns by the inclusion of a stage for live music, one or more dance floor areas and a DJ booth, where a DJ plays recorded music and where coloured lights illuminate the dance area. Another distinction is that whereas many pubs and sports bars aim at a mass market, nightclubs typically aim at a niche market of music and dancing enthusiasts and clubgoers. The upmarket nature of nightclubs can be seen in the inclusion of VIP areas in some nightclubs, for celebrities and their guests. Nightclubs are much more likely than pubs or sports bars to use bouncers to screen prospective clubgoers for entry. Some nightclub bouncers do not admit people with ripped jeans or other informal clothing as part of a dress code. The busiest nights for a nightclub are Friday and Saturday night. Most clubs or club nights cater to certain music genres.  - Opera (English plural: \\"operas\\"; Italian plural: \\"opere\\" ) is an art form in which singers and musicians perform a dramatic work combining text (libretto) and musical score, usually in a theatrical setting. In traditional opera, singers do two types of singing: recitative, a speech-inflected style and arias, a more melodic style. Opera incorporates many of the elements of spoken theatre, such as acting, scenery, and costumes and sometimes includes dance. The performance is typically given in an opera house, accompanied by an orchestra or smaller musical ensemble, which since the early 19th century has been led by a conductor.  - Nelson Ackerman Eddy (June 29, 1901  March 6, 1967) was an American singer and actor who appeared in 19 musical films during the 1930s and 1940s, as well as in opera and on the concert stage, radio, television, and in nightclubs. A classically trained baritone, he is best remembered for the eight films in which he costarred with soprano Jeanette MacDonald. He was one of the first \\"crossover\\" stars, a superstar appealing both to shrieking bobby soxers as well as opera purists, and in his heyday, he was the highest paid singer in the world.  - A baritone is a type of classical male singing voice whose vocal range lies between the bass and the tenor voice types. It is the most common male voice. Originally from the Greek , meaning \\"deep (or heavy) sounding\\", music for this voice is typically written in the range from the second F below middle C to the F above middle C (i.e. FF) in choral music, and from the second A below middle C to the A above middle C (A to A) in operatic music, but can be extended at either end. The baritone voice type is generally divided into the baryton-Martin baritone (light baritone), lyric baritone, \\"Kavalierbariton\\", Verdi baritone, dramatic baritone, \\"baryton-noble\\" baritone, and the bass-baritone.  - Bobby soxer is a 1940s sociological coinage describing the often very zealous fans of traditional pop music, in particular its creators like singer Frank Sinatra. Bobby soxers were usually teenage girls and young adult women from about 12 to 25. Fashionable adolescent girls wore poodle skirts and rolled down their socks to the ankle. In high schools and colleges, the gymnasium was often used as a dance floor; however, since street shoes and street detritus might damage the polished wood floors, the students were required to remove their shoes and flop dance in their bobby socks, hence the phrase \\"sock hop\\".  - The Love Parade is a 1929 American Pre-Code musical comedy film about the marital difficulties of Queen Louise of Sylvania (Jeanette MacDonald) and her consort, Count Alfred Renard (Maurice Chevalier). Despite his love for Louise and his promise to be an obedient husband, Count Alfred finds his role as a figurehead unbearable.  - Maurice Auguste Chevalier (September 12, 1888  January 1, 1972) was a French actor, cabaret singer and entertainer. He is perhaps best known for his signature songs, including \\"Louise\\", \\"Mimi\\", \\"Valentine\\", and \\"Thank Heaven for Little Girls\\" and for his films, including \\"The Love Parade\\" and \\"The Big Pond\\". His trademark attire was a boater hat, which he always wore on stage with a tuxedo.  - Sharon Rich (born June 11, 1953) is an author and film historian, best known for the biography \\"Sweethearts\\" about 1930s singing stars Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy. She was close friends for many years with Jeanette's older sister, actress Blossom Rock (aka Marie Blake). Along with interviewing hundreds of people, Rich had access to many collections of private letters, Eddys personal scrapbooks, diary entries, FBI files and MacDonalds unpublished autobiography. As follow up documentation to \\"Sweethearts\\", Rich has written several additional books and edited and written over seventy magazine articles. In 1995 she was awarded a Dame of Merit by the Knights of Malta for her contribution to History and Literature.  - Sweethearts : The Timeless Love Affair On screen and Off Between Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy is biographical book by Sharon Rich . First published in hardback in 1994 by Donald I. Fine , Inc. , the book covers the relationship of Jeanette MacDonald and Nelson Eddy . Rich drew heavily on Eddy 's mother , who had kept Eddy 's diaries and letters .  - Edith Marie Blossom MacDonald (August 21, 1895  January 14, 1978), known as Blossom Rock, was an American actress of stage, film and television. She was occasionally billed as Marie Blake or Blossom MacDonald. Her younger sister was screen actress and singer Jeanette MacDonald.  - One Hour with You is a 1932 American Pre-Code musical comedy film about a married couple who find themselves attracted to other people. It was produced and directed by Ernst Lubitsch \\"with the assistance of\\" George Cukor, and written by Samson Raphaelson, from the play \\"Only a Dream\\" by Lothar Schmidt. It stars Maurice Chevalier, Jeanette MacDonald and Genevieve Tobin and features Charles Ruggles and Roland Young. A French-language version, called \\"Une heure près de toi\\" was made simultaneously, with Lili Damita playing Genevieve Tobin's role.  - Love Me Tonight is a 1932 American Pre-Code musical comedy film produced and directed by Rouben Mamoulian, with music by Rodgers and Hart. It stars Maurice Chevalier as a tailor who poses as a nobleman and Jeanette MacDonald as a princess with whom he falls in love. It also stars Charles Ruggles as a penniless nobleman, along with Charles Butterworth and Myrna Loy as members of his family.  - A soprano is a type of classical female singing voice and has the highest vocal range of all voice types. The soprano's vocal range (using scientific pitch notation) is from approximately middle C (C) = 261 Hz to \\"high A\\" (A) =880 Hz in choral music, or to \\"soprano C\\" (C, two octaves above middle C) =1046 Hz or higher in operatic music. In four-part chorale style harmony, the soprano takes the highest part, which usually encompasses the melody.  The soprano voice type is generally divided into the coloratura, soubrette, lyric, spinto, and dramatic soprano. The lyric soprano is the most common female singing voice.  - Jeanette Anna MacDonald (June 18, 1903  January 14, 1965) was an American singer and actress best remembered for her musical films of the 1930s with Maurice Chevalier (\\"The Love Parade\\", \\"Love Me Tonight\\", \\"The Merry Widow\\" and \\"One Hour With You\\") and Nelson Eddy \\"Naughty Marietta\\", \\"Rose-Marie\\", and \\"Maytime\\"). During the 1930s and 1940s she starred in 29 feature films, four nominated for Best Picture Oscars (\\"The Love Parade\\", \\"One Hour with You\\", \\"Naughty Marietta\\" and \\"San Francisco\\"), and recorded extensively, earning three gold records. She later appeared in opera, concerts, radio, and television.

In multicellular organisms, mutations can be subdivided into germline mutations and somatic mutations. Germline mutations occur in the DNA of sex cells, or gametes, and are therefore potentially very serious. These mutations can be passed to the next generation. If the zygote contains the mutation, every cell in the resulting organism will have that mutation. If the mutation results in a disease phenotype, the mutation causes what is called a hereditary disease. Somatic mutations , which occur in somatic, or body, cells, cannot be passed to the next generation (offspring). Mutations present in a somatic cell of an organism will be present (by DNA replication and mitosis) in all descendants of that cell. If the mutation is present in a gene that is not used in that cell type, the mutation may have no effect. On the other hand, the mutation may lead to a serious medical condition such as cancer.  and the situation: The specialists studied two groups of larvae.

Below is a more detailed and extensive answer: \\"In the context of trust resources, the timeline for spending the funds significantly depends on the specific terms laid down by the grantor or the trust document itself. When discussing Warren Buffett's case, the statement does highlight that the proceeds from his Berkshire Hathaway shares are intended to be used for philanthropic purposes within 10 years after his estate has been settled. This is a predetermined timeline established by Buffett, and it serves as a guide for the trustees, who must ensure that the allocated resources are indeed spent within the stipulated timeframe. However, there can be variance in the spending timelines depending on different trusts and their stipulations or conditions. For example: 1. Spendthrift Trusts: Designed to protect beneficiaries from their own potential financial mismanagement, spendthrift trusts typically require that assets be distributed to beneficiaries over time, often through regular payments or upon the attainment of specific milestones (e.g., reaching a certain age, completing education, etc.).    2. Charitable Trusts: These types of trusts provide benefits to one or more charitable organizations, with the assets typically being disbursed over an extended timeframe or sometimes in perpetuity. In some cases, specific terms may dictate the timing of distributions to the charity or charitable causes, while in other cases, the philanthropic goals of the trust may be met through annual contributions or one-time lump-sum distributions. 3. Discretionary Trusts: In these trusts, the trustee exercises decision-making power over the distribution of assets to the beneficiaries. In this case, the timing for spending the trust resources can vary significantly, depending on the trustee's discretion and the beneficiary's circumstances.  4. Testamentary Trusts: These trusts, established by a deceased person's will, often have specific requirements for the distribution of assets, such as spending the resources within a certain number of years after the testator's death or upon the beneficiary reaching a certain age. The exact timing depends on the wording of the will and the goals of the testator. In conclusion, while the quote provided does give an accurate answer for Buffett's specific case, the spending timeline for trust resources can vary based on the unique circumstances and goals of different trust types and grantor intentions. The correct answer for when the trust resources must be spent depends on the specific trust document or stipulations set by the creator of the trust.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Premise: \\"uh-huh yeah i like him\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"He's one of my favorites.\\" true?","output":"Based on the premise \\"uh-huh yeah i like him,\\" it is not definitively possible to determine whether the hypothesis \\"He's one of my favorites\\" is true or not. While the statement \\"I like him\\" does indicate a positive regard for the person in question, it does not necessarily convey the strength or depth of that regard. To assess whether the hypothesis \\"He's one of my favorites\\" is true, we need to delve into various aspects of the premise and consider possible circumstances. 1. The phrase \\"uh-huh yeah\\" may be interpreted as agreement, but does not necessarily imply enthusiasm or strong emotion. It could be indicative of differing levels of enthusiasm, from mild interest to a stronger emotional attachment, depending on the context and tone of the conversation.  2. The term \\"favorite\\" has a stronger meaning than just \\"liking\\" someone. If someone is considered a favorite, it indicates that the person occupies a special position among a group of individuals. Although the premise suggests that the speaker likes the person in question, it doesn't strongly convey that the person is one of their favorites; it may simply mean that the person is perceived positively or is liked.  3. The context of the conversation should be taken into account to assess the hypothesis. For instance, if the discussion revolves around comparing multiple people or listing some of their most admired individuals, then the premise may imply that the person is one of the speaker's favorites. On the other hand, if the conversation is more casual, and the speaker is just sharing their thoughts, the premise may not necessarily indicate that the person is one of their favorites. 4. The speaker's personality, communication style, and prior statements could also influence the interpretation of the premise. If the speaker tends to downplay their emotions or uses subtle expressions to describe their feelings, then the premise may be an understated way of conveying that the person in question is one of their favorites. Conversely, if the speaker is known to be more expressive and effusive, the statement may simply mean that they like the person, but not to the level of being one of their favorites. 5. The connection between the speaker and the person in question must also be contemplated. If the speaker has a personal relationship with the individual, then they might consider him as one of their favorites. However, if their relationship lacks depth or is merely based on a single encounter, then the hypothesis remains inconclusive. In conclusion, based on the premise \\"uh-huh yeah i like him,\\" and without additional context or information, it is not possible to definitively determine whether the hypothesis \\"He's one of my favorites\\" is true or not. While there is evidence of a positive regard for the person in question, there is not enough information to ascertain if this extends to the level of being considered one of the speaker's favorites."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: George Gershwin, born in 1998, was one of America's greatest composers. He published his first song when he was eighteen years old. During the next twenty years he wrote more than five hundred songs. Many of Gershwin's songs were first written for musical plays performed in theatres in New York City. These plays were a popular form of entertainment in the 1920s and 1930s. Many of his songs have remained popular as ever. Over the years they have been sung and played in every possible way -- from jazz to country. In the 1920s there was a debate in the United States about jazz music. Could jazz, some people asked, be considered serious music? In 1924 jazz musician and orchestra leader Paul Whiteman decided to organize a special concert to show that jazz was serious music. Gershwin agreed to compose something for the concert before he realized he had just a few weeks to do it. And in that short time, he composed a piece for piano and orchestra which he called Rhapsody in Blue. Gershwin himself played the piano at the concert. The audience were thrilled when they heard his music. It made him world-famous and showed that jazz music could be both serious and popular. In 1928, Gershwin went to Paris. He applied to study composition  with the well-known musician Nadia Boulanger, but she rejected him. She was afraid that classical study would ruin his jazz-influenced style. While there, Gershwin wrote An American in Paris. When it was first performed, critics  were divided over the music. Some called it happy and full of life, to others it was silly and boring. But it quickly became popular in Europe and the United States. It still remains one of his most famous works. George Gershwin died in 1937, just days after doctors learned he had brain cancer. He was only thirty-nine years old. Newspapers all over the world reported his death on their front pages. People mourned the loss of the man and all the music he might have still written.

Article:","output":"Title: How to Create a Faux Hickey with Eye Shadow: A Step-by-Step Guide Introduction A hickey, also known as a love bite or a kiss mark, is essentially a bruise that occurs as a result of kissing, sucking, or biting the skin. While some may wear hickeys with pride, others prefer to leave their private lives more discreet. For those who fall into the latter category, creating a faux hickey can be a fun and harmless way to experiment with this sort of temporary body modification. In this article, we'll show you how to create a convincing fake hickey using a large eye shadow palette. Step 1: Choose the Location for the Hickey Before you get started with applying makeup, you'll need to choose the perfect spot for your hickey. Real hickeys can occur anywhere on the body, but are most commonly found on the neck, shoulders, or collarbone area. These locations are ideal for a fake hickey, too, as they're often exposed and easy to reach with your makeup brush. Step 2: Obtain a Large Eye Shadow Palette To achieve a realistic faux hickey, it's essential to have a wide range of colors to work with. A large eye shadow palette with multiple shades of pink, purple, and blue is ideal. These colors will allow you to create depth and dimension, making your fake hickey appear more convincing. Look for a palette that includes both matte and shimmer shades, as the combination of textures will enhance the hickey's appearance. Step 3: Apply the Pink Eye Shadow Once you've chosen your makeup palette and located the perfect spot for your hickey, it's time to begin applying your eye shadow. Start with a light pink shade, as this will form the base of the hickey. It's important to begin with a lighter color, as this will make it easier to blend the other shades together for a seamless look. Use a small, precise makeup brush to apply the pink eye shadow over the area you've chosen for the hickey, making sure to blend the edges for a smooth transition into your natural skin tone. Step 4: Add the Purple Eye Shadow Next, you'll want to add some depth and dimension to your faux hickey. To do this, use a slightly darker purple eye shadow from your palette. Applying the purple shade over the pink will create the appearance of bruising, making your fake hickey look more authentic. Focus on the center of the pink area, but be sure to blend the edges for a seamless transition between the two colors. Step 5: Add the Blue Eye Shadow After the pink and purple eye shadows have been applied, use a small amount of blue eye shadow to enhance the hickey's three-dimensional appearance. Blue will add a cool undertone to the mix, making the fake bruise appear more realistic. Use the blue eye shadow sparingly, though, as you don't want the color to be too overpowering. Simply dab a little blue on top of the purple eye shadow and blend gently to create the desired effect. Step 6: Set the Makeup Once you've achieved your desired hickey appearance, it's important to set your makeup so that it stays in place and doesn't smudge or fade throughout the day. To do this, simply apply a translucent setting powder or setting spray over the entire hickey. This will lock in the eye shadow and ensure that your faux hickey remains intact for as long as you want it to last. Conclusion Creating a fake hickey with eye shadow is a fun and easy way to experiment with body art, allowing you to enjoy the temporary thrill of sporting a love bite without any unwanted attention or permanent damage to your skin. Just follow these simple steps, and before long, you'll have a realistic-looking faux hickey that's sure to turn heads!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The match set several new records for Super Rugby including the highest aggregate score in a single match ( 137 points ) , highest score by an away side ( 72 ) and the most tries scored in a Super Rugby match ( 18 ) . Braid appeared 8 times during the 2010 season as the Chiefs finished in 10th place . In 2011 , he signed with the Blues , with whom he appeared in the 2011 Super Rugby semi-finals . In 2012 , he captained the side in a number of matches whilst regular captain Keven Mealamu was injured . In November 2014 , it was Braid revealed that he would join French Top 14 side Bordeaux at the conclusion of the 2015 Super Rugby season .  - New Zealand is an island nation in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. The country geographically comprises two main landmassesthat of the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Mui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamuand numerous smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland.  - Daniel John Braid (born 23 February 1981) is a rugby union player from New Zealand who captains Sale Sharks in the English Premiership. He normally plays at open-side flanker. Previously, he played for the Blues in Super Rugby. He also won six full caps for the All Blacks between 2002 and 2010.  - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight.  - Super Rugby (rendered in the current competition logo as \\"SupeRugby\\") is the preeminent professional men's rugby union football competition in the Southern Hemisphere and Japan. Building off various Southern Hemisphere competitions dating back to the South Pacific Championship in 1986, with teams from a number of southern nations, Super Rugby officially started with the 1996 season with 12 teams from Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. The competition was known as Super 12 through to the end of the 2005 season; the name was changed to Super 14 with the addition of two teams for the 2006 season; with expansion to 15 teams in the three countries for the 2011 season, the competition was rebranded as Super Rugby (no number included). By 2006, matches were being broadcast in 41 countries.   - Sale Sharks is an English professional rugby union club that plays in the English Premiership.  - The South Pacific Championship (\\"also known as \\"SPC\\"\\") was a rugby union competition that was introduced in 1986 and contested through to 1990. The competition featured six teams - three provinces from New Zealand; Auckland, Canterbury and Wellington, two Australian teams; Queensland and New South Wales, and one team representing Pacific Island rugby, Fiji.  - A try is a way of scoring points in rugby union and rugby league football. A try is scored by grounding the ball (the ball must be touching the player when coming into contact with the ground) in the opposition's in-goal area (on or behind the goal line). Rugby union and league differ slightly in defining 'grounding the ball' and the 'in-goal' area.  - Rugby is a type of football developed at Rugby School in Rugby, Warwickshire, one of many versions of football played at English public schools in the 19th century. The two main types of rugby are rugby league and rugby union. Although rugby league initially used rugby union rules, they are now wholly separate sports.  - Rugby union, or simply rugby, is a contact team sport which originated in England in the first half of the 19th century. One of the two codes of rugby football, it is based on running with the ball in hand. In its most common form, a game is between two teams of 15 players using an oval-shaped ball on a rectangular field with H-shaped goalposts on each try line.    What is the relationship between 'luke braid' and 'rugby union player'? Answer:","output":"Luke Braid is a rugby union player who has had a successful career in the sport. Born on October 5, 1988, Braid is known for playing as a loose forward with the Blues in Super Rugby and Auckland in the ITM Cup. He has also played for three national rugby union teams, including the New Zealand Schoolboys, the New Zealand Under 19's, and the New Zealand Under 20's. Coming from a family with a rugby background, Luke Braid's father is former player Gary Braid, and his older brother is fellow Blues player Daniel Braid. Luke Braid's connection to the term \\"rugby union player\\" is thus established through his professional career and personal life in the sport of rugby union."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This work could have been just that; marvelous and replete with mythological references which kept my fascination fueled. The lead characters (Charles Brady played by Brian Krause; and his mother Mary, played by Alice Krige) were shallowly done, had no depth of personality and were hardly likable or drawing. Not even Mädchen Amick (who played Tanya Robertson)'s character fit into that description.  However, as I've said many times before, when you adapt a Stephen King novel for TV, you simply must take into account the fact that his books aren't written for TV, and his screenplay talent sadly lacks the fire and depth he exhibits as a novelist.  This is another botched attempt to take the magick of Stephen King writing, whether that is of his novels or an original screenplay. To simply cut and paste his work onto the small screen. His novels get completely bastardized in the process and all you end up creating is a nice movie; nothing less but certainly nothing more. His screenplays are hit and miss.

Movie title: I Come in Peace Movie plot: Houston cop Jack Caine will not let police procedure prevent him pursuing his mission to wipe out the White Boys, a gang of white collar drug dealers who killed his partner while Caine was stopping a convenience store robbery. The White Boys disguise their narcotics trafficking behind rows of expensive luxury sports cars, executive level jobs, and flashy designer suits. Led by the vicious but urbane Victor Manning, the White Boys operate above accusation but not suspicion. Law enforcement knows they are dirty, but they cannot prove it. Caine is determined to bring them down. Caine's superior is tired of his unusual and improper tactics. Meanwhile, Caine's girlfriend, coroner Diane Pallone, wants him to make a stronger commitment to their relationship. When the White Boys steal a shipment of heroin from a federal evidence warehouse, they hide evidence of their involvement by blowing up the facility, killing or injuring numerous people. This brings in the FBI, which becomes involved in Caine's vendetta against the White Boys. Caine is partnered with a by-the-book partner, FBI agent Arwood \\"Larry\\" Smith.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which city experienced fewer rocks breaking?  Hint: Almost all earthquakes occur at plate boundaries. All types of plate boundaries have earthquakes. Convection within the Earth causes the plates to move. As the plates move, stresses build. When the stresses build too much, the rocks break. The break releases the energy that was stored in the rocks. The sudden release of energy creates an earthquake.

This is primarily attributable to the fact that they possess a high energy content and can create considerable heat as they burn. Moreover, with their rapid growth and ability to thrive in various climates, they are a popular choice for firewood.

Answer the following question: I can use this background: Some of Antarctica has been warming up; particularly strong warming has been noted on the Antarctic Peninsula. A study by Eric Steig published in 2009 noted for the first time that the continent-wide average surface temperature trend of Antarctica is slightly positive at >0.05 °C (0.09 °F) per decade from 1957 to 2006. This study also noted that West Antarctica has warmed by more than 0.1 °C (0.2 °F) per decade in the last 50 years, and this warming is strongest in winter and spring. This is partly offset by autumn cooling in East Antarctica. There is evidence from one study that Antarctica is warming as a result of human carbon dioxide emissions, but this remains ambiguous. The amount of surface warming in West Antarctica, while large, has not led to appreciable melting at the surface, and is not directly affecting the West Antarctic Ice Sheet's contribution to sea level. Instead the recent increases in glacier outflow are believed to be due to an inflow of warm water from the deep ocean, just off the continental shelf. The net contribution to sea level from the Antarctic Peninsula is more likely to be a direct result of the much greater atmospheric warming there.In 2002 the Antarctic Peninsula's Larsen-B ice shelf collapsed. Between 28 February and 8 March 2008, about 570 km2 (220 sq mi) of ice from the Wilkins Ice Shelf on the southwest part of the peninsula collapsed, putting the remaining 15,000 km2 (5,800 sq mi) of the ice shelf at risk. The ice was being held back by a \\"thread\\" of ice about 6 km (4 mi) wide, prior to its collapse on 5 April 2009. According to NASA, the most widespread Antarctic surface melting of the past 30 years occurred in 2005, when an area of ice comparable in size to California briefly melted and refroze; this may have resulted from temperatures rising to as high as 5 °C (41 °F).A study published in Nature Geoscience in 2013 (online in December 2012) identified central West Antarctica as one of the fastest-warming regions on Earth. The researchers present a complete temperature...  Now, I have a new situation: Two climate experts studied different continent to observe climate changes. Jordan studied Australia, while Jeb studied Antarctica.  Answer this question please: Which person observed a strong warming on the Antarctic Peninsula? Answer:","output":"Jeb observed a strong warming on the Antarctic Peninsula. This is because Jeb studied Antarctica, where the Antarctic Peninsula is located, as mentioned in the background information provided."},{"instruction":"Given the question: I read this background article the other day: Depleted soils can be protected from soil erosion by groundcover plants such as naturally growing grasses in agroforestry systems. These help to stabilise the soil as they increase cover compared to short-cycle cropping systems. Soil cover is a crucial factor in preventing erosion. Cleaner water through reduced nutrient and soil surface runoff can be a further advantage of agroforestry. The runoff can be reduced by decreasing its velocity and increasing infiltration into the soil. Compared to row-cropped fields nutrient uptake can be higher and reduce nutrient loss into streams.Further advantages concerning plant growth:  I am facing a new situation today: Gary and Joe are two farmers. Joe's  farm has a depleted soil, while Gary started agroforestry a few years back, and grows cover crops.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Here's a question: What would cause someone to have to re illustrate point?  Here are possible answers to this question: - teacher - did not understand - agree with - understanding - understood  I believe the correct choice is \\"did not understand\\", here's why: A:","output":"The correct choice is indeed \\"did not understand,\\" and I'll provide an explanation as to why this is the case. When someone needs to re-illustrate a point, it usually means that they have to explain or clarify a concept or idea again. This can happen when the initial explanation or illustration was not clear, comprehensive, or effective enough for the listener to fully grasp the information being presented. In this case, the need to re-illustrate a point stems from a lack of understanding on the part of the person receiving the information. Now, let's examine each possible answer to understand why \\"did not understand\\" is the correct choice: 1. Teacher: While a teacher may be the person who needs to re-illustrate a point, the presence of a teacher doesn't directly cause the need for re-illustration. A teacher's role is to facilitate understanding, but they are not the reason for re-illustrating a point. 2. Did not understand: As mentioned above, this is the correct answer. The need to re-illustrate a point is driven by the fact that the person receiving the information did not understand the initial explanation or illustration. 3. Agree with: Agreeing with a point does not necessitate re-illustration. If someone agrees with a point, it means they have understood it and there would be no need to clarify or explain it again. 4. Understanding: Understanding a point also does not require re-illustration. If a person has a solid grasp of the concept or idea being presented, there would be no need to re-illustrate the point. 5. Understood: Similar to the previous two options, having understood a point negates the need for re-illustration. Re-illustrating a point is only necessary when there is a lack of understanding. In summary, the correct choice for what would cause someone to have to re-illustrate a point is \\"did not understand,\\" as this highlights the need for clarification or further explanation to ensure the listener fully comprehends the information being shared."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Back at the sheriff’s headquarters, she sat in an interview room making small talk about her nickname “Debbie” and where she lived.      But then the conversation turned serious when she was told she’s the accused shooter in South Florida’s killer clown case from 27 years earlier.      Authorities had come to hold her accountable for the May 26, 1990, slaying of Marlene Warren, 40, in Wellington.      Keen Warren placed her head down on a desk and declined to say another word.      This glimpse of Keen Warren’s Sept. 26 capture, and the renewed investigation that led to it after all these years, is detailed in files released Thursday by the Palm Beach County State Attorney’s Office, in response to public records requests.

Keen Warren’s husband, Michael Warren, was married to the murder victim and was labeled an original person of interest by police. Authorities won’t say if he is still a suspect.      Sheriff Ric Bradshaw told reporters after Keen Warren’s arrest it “remains to be seen” whether anyone else will be charged in the case. Michael Warren, who has long denied any role, was en route to Calder Race Track with friends at the time his wife was shot at their home in the Aero Club community.      The 2,847 pages of documents released Thursday include new allegations along with all of the original investigative reports that made the case so remarkable: Marlene Warren opened the door to greet a clown wearing an orange wig, a red bulb nose, gloves and a smile painted on its white face. The clown held two balloons and flowers in one hand and a pistol in the other.      The clown fired at Warren’s face. She died within two days. The clown fled in a white Chrysler LeBaron, which was found four days later abandoned at a shopping center parking lot.      Here are some of the revelations from the evidence also recently shared with Keen Warren’s lawyer:      — Detectives collected samples of Sheila Keen’s hair and vials of her blood through a June 1990 search warrant, because she was then a suspect. There was also a court-ordered search of her apartment that yielded fibers from a bright orange wig and clothing that police were checking for blood stains. And similar fibers were found in the getaway car.      — In the reopened investigation, those samples were sent to an FBI crime lab and some matches were made to fibers collected from the Chrysler, though a precise DNA connection is not included. “Sheila Keen can be included as a possible source of these hairs,” according to a 2016 investigator’s report. But the FBI lab’s report was not released to reporters.      — Michael Warren was listed as the beneficiary of a life insurance police issued for his wife Marlene Warren in March 1979. In May 2017, Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance confirmed that “the death claim was paid in June 1991 in the amount of 53,359.37 to Michael Warren.”      — An attorney, Christopher DeSantis, gave investigators a statement in 1991 concerning his conversation two years earlier with Michael Warren as they left a courthouse. Warren “asked me what the ramifications would be if a husband killed his wife on her estate,” DeSantis said then. The lawyer advised that if the husband had a friend who did it and they couldn’t tie the husband to the friend, he’d get away Scott free.      — In October 2017, DeSantis gave another statement to investigators. This time, he said he “he told Mike Warren … that if someone wore a clown suit they would get off because no one would be able to identify the features such as male/female or identity of the person committing the crime.”      — One day after Keen Warren’s arrest, Palm Beach County detectives met with an employee of the Kingsport, Tenn., restaurant formerly owned by Michael and Sheila Keen Warren. The employee, Julia Thomas, said her former roommate and co-worker, Danielle Sweeting, told her of a time that “Debbie” got drunk and confessed to her. “Debbie said that she had picked out the clown outfit and killed his wife,” Thomas recalled.      — Marlene’s son Joseph Ahrens and another person, Jean Pratt, got into a car and chased the clown moments after the shooting. Detectives wrote that Jean Pratt told investigators in a June 27, 1991, statement that “the clown suspect was definitely a man. … It wasn’t a woman.”      — Michael Warren’s friends told police that he “did not act very upset” after his wife’s death. Witnesses told the cops that a few months before the murder they observed fights between Marlene and Michael Warren, as well as Marlene confronting Sheila Keen about having an affair with Michael.      — Marlene Warren’s funeral was videotaped, but detectives who reviewed it saw nothing useful to the investigation.      For the past 15 years, the Warrens lived in small, historic Abingdon, Va., within the Blue Ridge Mountains. They had a reputation as a hardworking, sociable couple who until last year operated a popular fast-food restaurant in nearby Kingsport, Tenn.      Keen, then 27, had been working for Michael Warren’s used car dealership, Bargain Motors Inc. of West Palm Beach, helping to repossess cars.      During the original murder investigation, detectives discovered Warren was rolling back odometers on vehicles at his used car lot. He was convicted of racketeering and multiple other felonies and served nearly four years in a minimum-security state prison at the Homestead Correctional Institution. He was released on New Year's Eve 1997. ||||| WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) — Two nights before a clown fatally shot a woman at her front door, a customer showed up at a nearby costume shop and begged to be let in at closing.      On this night 28 years ago, the woman urgently told two clerks she needed a clown suit, an orange wig, white gloves, a red nose and enough white makeup to cover her face completely. She passed on the floppy shoes. One of the clerks in a photo lineup identified the customer as Sheila Keen, who was rumored in May 1990 to be having an affair with victim Marlene Warren's husband. The other clerk thought it might be Keen, but wasn't 100 percent.      Palm Beach County prosecutors released late Thursday evidence that they say helped them and sheriff's detectives to arrest Keen in September at the Abington, Virginia, home she shared with her husband — Michael Warren, Marlene Warren's widower. The evidence includes hundreds of pages of witness statements, photographs, reports and maps. It also says recent DNA tests conducted by the FBI say hair found in a car linked to the slaying could have come from Sheila Keen Warren.      Prosecutors released the evidence without comment. Her attorney, Richard Lubin, did not immediately return a call and email seeking comment. Michael Warren, reached by phone, declined comment. Detectives have declined to rule him out as a possible suspect. Keen Warren, now 54, remains jailed without bond. Prosecutors have said they will seek the death penalty.      According to the documents, she became a suspect shortly after the slaying.      Marlene Warren, 40, opened her door on a Saturday morning to find a clown in an orange wig, a red nose but normal high-top shoes holding two foil balloons and carnations. Her then 20-year-old son and his friends, who were in the house, say the clown handed her the gifts. The clown without saying a word then shot her in the face, walked slowly to a Chrysler LeBaron convertible and drove away.      Michael Warren at the time owned a used car lot and Sheila Keen did repossessions for him. Other employees, according to the document, told detectives Warren and Keen had been seen kissing and having sex in the office and her neighbors said he was frequently at her house. Warren and Keen denied a relationship. They married in 2002.      The documents show that immediately after the shooting, detectives worked to find where the clown costume, the balloons and flowers had been purchased and to find the car. Along with the costume shop employees, the detectives learned the flowers and balloons came from a supermarket a half mile from the victim's home, bought by a woman who looked like Keen who wore white gloves.      The LeBaron was soon found abandoned in a parking lot. It had been reported stolen by a Payless rental agency near Michael Warren's car lot, Bargain Motors. The couple who rented it last told detectives they had arrived afterhours at the Payless, hoping to leave the car. Finding no employees, they went home, looked in the Yellow Pages and called what they thought was Payless. A man told them to leave the car with its keys in the visor in front of the lot and someone would get it. They reluctantly did.      When they went back later, the car was gone, so they called the number again and the same man acted like he never spoke to them. The next morning they realized they had called Bargain Motors — its Yellow Page ad read \\"Payless!\\" The rental agency had previously sued Michael Warren over the ad and an employee told detectives Michael Warren and another employee had pulled the ruse to steal the car as payback. No one was ever charged with the theft.      Warren told detectives he and his wife had a good relationship, but his employees and her family said Marlene Warren had been threatening to divorce him over numerous affairs and a beating she said he had administered a year before. Warren's employees told detectives he had said he would never divorce because his wife would get half his assets.      Keen was interviewed by detectives shortly after the shooting and blood and hair were collected. She denied being the shooter, saying she was in another part of the county looking for cars that needed to be repossessed.      Michael Warren was convicted in 1994 of grand theft, racketeering and odometer tampering and served almost four years in prison. After his wedding to Keen, they settled in Virginia just across from Kingsport, Tennessee, where they operated a popular restaurant that they sold just before her arrest. ||||| Summary:","output":"Sheila Keen Warren, formerly known as Debbie, is a 54-year-old woman who has been charged in the so-called \\"killer clown case\\", the murder of Marlene Warren (40) in Wellington, Florida on May 26, 1990. Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty for the accused, Sheila, who was captured on September 26. It has been revealed that recent testing of DNA evidence was the key to cracking the high-profile case that remained unsolved for 27 years. The case is now the center of a death penalty prosecution. Michael Warren, Sheila's husband at the time, was married to the murder victim and was labeled an original person of interest by police. Authorities have however not stated if he is still a suspect in the case. According to numerous witness statements, Michael Warren did not appear to be upset after his wife's death, often engaged in fights with Marlene and had been accused of having an affair with Sheila. Detectives collected samples of Sheila's hair and blood in June 1990, as she was a suspect. During the reopened case, samples were sent to the FBI crime lab and were found to match fibers collected from the Chrysler getaway car.

This article: The seabed contains enormous reserves of minerals which can be exploited by dredging. This has advantages over land-based mining in that equipment can be built at specialised shipyards and infrastructure costs are lower. Disadvantages include problems caused by waves and tides, the tendency for excavations to silt up and the washing away of spoil heaps. There is a risk of coastal erosion and environmental damage. Seafloor massive sulphide deposits are potential sources of silver, gold, copper, lead and zinc and trace metals since their discovery in the 1960s. They form when geothermally heated water is emitted from deep sea hydrothermal vents known as \\"black smokers\\". The ores are of high quality but prohibitively costly to extract. Small scale mining of the deep sea floor is being developed off the coast of Papua New Guinea using robotic techniques, but the obstacles are formidable.There are large deposits of petroleum, as oil and natural gas, in rocks beneath the seabed. Offshore platforms and drilling rigs extract the oil or gas and store it for transport to land. Offshore oil and gas production can be difficult due to the remote, harsh environment. Drilling for oil in the sea has environmental impacts. Animals may be disorientated by seismic waves used to locate deposits, probably causing the beaching of whales. Toxic substances such as mercury, lead and arsenic may be released. The infrastructure may cause damage, and oil may be spilt.Large quantities of methane clathrate exist on the seabed and in ocean sediment at a temperature of around 2 °C (36 °F) and these are of interest as a potential energy source. Some estimates put the amount available at between one and 5 million cubic kilometres (0.24 to 1.2 million cubic miles).

Answer the following question: Given the following context:  Ethiopian historians such as Taddesse Tamrat (1935–2013) and Sergew Hable Sellassie have argued that modern Ethiopian studies were an invention of the 17th century and originated in Europe. Tamrat considered Carlo Conti Rossini's 1928 Storia d'Etiopia a groundbreaking work in Ethiopian studies. The philosopher Messay Kebede likewise acknowledged the genuine contributions of Western scholars to the understanding of Ethiopia's past. But he also criticized the perceived scientific and institutional bias that he found to be pervasive in Ethiopian-, African-, and Western-made historiographies on Ethiopia. Specifically, Kebede took umbrage at E. A. Wallis Budge's translation of the Kebra Nagast, arguing that Budge had assigned a South Arabian origin to the Queen of Sheba although the Kebra Nagast itself did not indicate such a provenience for this fabled ruler. According to Kebede, a South Arabian extraction was contradicted by biblical exegetes and testimonies from ancient historians, which instead indicated that the Queen was of African origin. Additionally, he chided Budge and Ullendorff for their postulation that the Aksumite civilization was founded by Semitic immigrants from South Arabia. Kebede argued that there is little physical difference between the Semitic-speaking populations in Ethiopia and neighboring Cushitic-speaking groups to validate the notion that the former groups were essentially descendants of South Arabian settlers, with a separate ancestral origin from other local Afroasiatic-speaking populations. He also observed that these Afroasiatic-speaking populations were heterogeneous, having interbred with each other and also assimilated alien elements of both uncertain extraction and negroid origin.  answer the following question:  What was the full name of the person Messay Kebede argued had assigned a South Arabian origin to the Queen of Sheba?

Question: I am trying to decide whether it's worth it to invest in this film proposal. Can you help me answer a few questions? If you can't, please say \\"No I can't\\".  Question: What celebration are they at? Movie title: Uncle Sam Movie plot: In Kuwait, a military unit uncovers an American helicopter downed by friendly fire at least three years ago. As the wreckage is inspected, Master Sergeant Sam Harper, one of the burnt bodies within, springs to life and kills a sergeant and a major, and returns to an inert state after muttering, \\"Don't be afraid, it's only friendly fire!\\" Weeks later, Sam's body is delivered to his hometown of Twin Rivers, which is preparing for Independence Day. Sam's wife Louise is given custody of the casket containing Sam's remains, which are left in the home of Sam's estranged sister Sally, who lives with her patriotic young son, Jody. Sam reanimates in the early hours of the Fourth of July, and proceeds to kill and steal the costume of a perverted Uncle Sam. Sam then makes his way to a cemetery, where he murders two of three juvenile delinquents who had vandalized tombstones, and desecrated an American flag. During the Independence Day celebration (which a corrupt congressman is visiting) Sam beheads the third delinquent, kills Jody's teacher (who had opposed the Vietnam War) with a hatchet, and shoots Sally's unscrupulous lawyer boyfriend in the head. Despite these deaths, the festivities continue, but are thrown into disarray when Sam uses the fireworks gear to blow up the congressman, and a flagpole to impale Louise's deputy boyfriend. As this occurs, Jody is told by his mother and aunt that his supposedly heroic idol Sam was in fact an alcoholic psychopath who physically and sexually abused them, and only joined the military so he could get a \\"free pass\\" to kill people. Jody is told by Barry, another boy who has established an unexplained mental link with Sam, that the undead Sam is responsible for the deaths. With help from Sam's old mentor Jed, the boys goes to Jody's house, where they find the lecherous sergeant who had dropped Sam off dead, and stuffed inside Sam's coffin.

A comma is used after the introductory phrase \\"For the next three years\\". Commas are often used to set off introductory elements in a sentence, making the structure of the sentence clearer for the reader. 2. Another comma is used before \\"before accepting a temporary post at the University of Notre Dame in 1952.\\" This provides a pause in the sentence, clearly separating his traveling habit and his eventual acceptance of a temporary post. This makes the sentence easier to understand.

Living in a small town on the outskirts of the urban landscape, Papa Boule has been keeping his work closely guarded, sharing his plans only with his late wife, with whom he shared a deep connection. The story begins when a young, passionate journalist, Emily, stumbles upon an anonymous tip about Papa Boule's ground-breaking work. Intrigued by the idea, she decides to investigate his life to uncover the truth behind the eco-city's existence. As Emily gets deeper into her investigation, she comes to know Papa Boule's exceptional past wherein he had brought significant innovation in the field of engineering. Her fascination towards the engineer and his work only grows stronger, and she actively starts seeking ways to interview him. However, Emily's investigation catches the attention of a corrupt group of powerful politicians and businessmen who've heavily invested in non-renewable energy resources. Fearful that Papa Boule's eco-city will jeopardize their wealth and power, they plot to execute him and steal his blueprints to bury the idea forever. Unaware of the impending danger, Emily finally meets Papa Boule and finds a father figure in him, while also learning the importance of love for the environment and humanity. Feeling a deep connection, Emily promises to help him spread his vision for the eco-city and gain the recognition he deserves. As the corrupt group inches closer to executing their sinister plan, Emily must race against time to protect Papa Boule and his pioneering ideas.

Even though both the premise and the hypothesis mention \\"small entities\\" and \\"second/tier II\\", there is no direct evidence in the premise that supports the claim of the hypothesis. The premise speaks about the supposed impact (a large decrease in reimbursement rates for meals served) on a specific group of small entities - tier II day care home providers. The premise does not however imply any form of composition or hierarchical structure of these small entities, much less a 'second tier', as stated in the hypothesis. The hypothesis, on the other hand, makes a claim about the composition/structure of 'small entities', placing them under the 'second tier'. But no such organization is mentioned or implied in the premise. Therefore, there's no substantiated connection between the scenario provided in the premise and the categorical claim made in the hypothesis to conclude if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis.

The premise specifically discloses that \\"the small entities\\" refers to \\"tier II day care home providers\\", whereas the hypothesis might be talking about \\"the small entities\\" in a different context that we are not told.

This carbon is not recycled until it is used by humans. The burning of fossil fuels releases more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere than is used by photosynthesis. So, there is more carbon dioxide entering the atmosphere than is coming out of it. Carbon dioxide is known as a greenhouse gas , since it lets in light energy but does not let heat escape, much like the panes of a greenhouse. The increase of greenhouse gasses in the atmosphere is contributing to a global rise in Earth’s temperature, known as global warming or global climate change.

Wall Street is an eight-block-long street running roughly northwest to southeast from Broadway to South Street, at the East River, in the Financial District of Lower Manhattan in New York City. Over time, the term has become a metonym for the financial markets of the United States as a whole, the American financial services industry (even if financial firms are not physically located there), or New York-based financial interests.  Anchored by Wall Street, New York City has been called both the most economically powerful city and the leading financial center of the world, and the city is home to the world's two largest stock exchanges by total market capitalization, the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ. Several other major exchanges have or had headquarters in the Wall Street area, including the New York Mercantile Exchange, the New York Board of Trade, and the former American Stock Exchange.  There are varying accounts about how the Dutch-named \\"de Waalstraat\\" got its name. A generally accepted version is that the name of the street was derived from a wall (actually a wooden palisade) on the northern boundary of the New Amsterdam settlement, built to protect against Native Americans, pirates, and the British. A conflicting explanation is that Wall Street was named after \\"Walloons\\"— the Dutch name for a \\"Walloon\\" is \\"Waal\\". Among the first settlers that embarked on the ship \\"Nieu Nederlandt\\" in 1624 were 30 Walloon families.

They have been quite successful in their pursuit. Moreover, the citizens of Ecuador are receptive about the idea of increased biodiversity. On the contrary, the Government of Oman was not very active in increasing the biodiversity of their country. As a result, Oman, at present, is not very biodiverse.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Would Oman have less or more stable ecosystem funcions than Ecuador? Answer:","output":"Based on the knowledge acquired from the background article, Oman would likely have less stable ecosystem functions than Ecuador due to its lower biodiversity. As the article suggests, higher levels of biodiversity contribute to increased stability of ecosystem functions through time, as well as greater productivity and more efficient resource capture. Since Ecuador has been actively working to increase its biodiversity and has been successful in doing so, it would likely have more stable ecosystem functions in comparison to Oman."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

News article: Tom Cruise is the clear winner at North American multiplexes this weekend with “Mission: Impossible — Fallout,” heading for a solid 35 million second weekend, estimates showed Saturday.      Paramount’s second weekend of “Fallout” easily topped the launch of Disney’s live-action “Christopher Robin,” which debuted with a respectable 27 million at 3,602 screens at the low end of forecasts. Lionsgate’s action-comedy “The Spy Who Dumped Me” will finish third with about 12.4 million at 3,111 locations, matching expectations.      Fox’s opening of dystopian sci-fier “The Darkest Minds” debuted quietly with about 6 million at 3,127 locations behind a quartet of holdovers — Universal’s third weekend of “Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again” with 9 million, Sony’s third weekend of “The Equalizer 2” with 8.3 million, Sony’s fourth weekend of “Hotel Transylvania 3: Summer Vacation,” with 8.1 million and Disney’s fifth weekend of “Ant-Man and the Wasp” with 6.3 million.      Dinesh D’Souza’s pro-Donald Trump documentary “Death of a Nation: Can We Save America a Second Time?” is launching in 13th place with 2.7 million at 1,032 locations this weekend for Quality Flix.

The action-thriller is also performing better than 2015’s “Mission: Impossible — Rogue Nation,” which won its second weekend over “Fantastic Four” with 28 million. “Fallout” should wind up the weekend with 124 million in its first 10 days.      “Fallout” won Friday with 9.8 million, 300,000 better than “Christopher Robin,” which opened amid a campaign aimed at nostalgia-loving adults and their children. Based on the characters from A.A. Milne’s Winnie the Pooh books, the story centers on Ewan McGregor’s sad middle-aged version of Christopher Robin being emotionally rescued by his childhood friends Winnie the Pooh, Piglet, Tigger, and Eeyore.      Marc Forster, returning to the same territory as “Finding Neverland,” directed “Christopher Robin.” Audiences gave “Christopher Robin” an A CinemaScore while critics were mostly positive with a 67% rating on Rotten Tomatoes.      Lionsgate-Imagine’s “The Spy Who Dumped Me” stars Mila Kunis and Kate McKinnon as best friends pursued through Europe by assassins. The raucous R-rated comedy earned a B CinemaScore. Susanna Fogel directed and co-wrote with David Iserson, while Justin Theroux, Gillian Anderson, Hasan Minhaj, and Sam Heughan round out the cast. “Spy” carries a 39% rating on Rotten Tomatoes.      “The Darkest Minds,” which carries a 34 million price tag, performed at the low end of modest expectations. The film is based on Alexandra Bracken’s novel and set in a dystopian America where a group of teenagers is on the run from the government after mysteriously obtaining superpowers. The film stars Amandla Stenberg, Mandy Moore, and Gwendoline Christie. Reviewers have been underwhelmed with a Rotten Tomatoes score of 19%.      With the top two films combining for about 60 million, overall domestic moviegoing should be up significantly over the same 2017 weekend, which was led by “The Dark Tower” with 19 million in its debut — marking the start of one of the slowest Augusts in more than a decade. Summer domestic box office is up a hefty 10.4% to 3.46 billion as of Aug. 1, according to comScore, and year-to-date domestic box office is also leading last year by 7.6% at 7.4 billion. ||||| R-rated comedy 'The Spy Who Dumped Me' and pro-Trump documentary 'Death of a Nation' are also opening nationwide; 'Black Panther' leaps past 700 million in North America nearly six months after hitting theaters.      In the showdown between Tom Cruise and Winnie the Pooh at the box office, Cruise is winning.      Paramount's Mission: Impossible — Fallout is pacing to gross 35 million or more in its second weekend for a decline of just 43 percent. Disney's new family offering, Christopher Robin — inspired by the classic children's tale Winnie the Pooh — is projected to earn 25 million-27 million in its domestic debut.      Christopher Robin earned 9.5 million on Friday, including 1.5 million in Thursday previews, compared to 9.9 million for M:I6. Prerelease tracking had showed Disney's live-action/CGI hybrid opening to 28 million or more, with many services predicting 30 million-plus.      And in other Disney news, the studio announced Saturday that Black Panther is crossing the 700 million mark in North America, becoming only the third film to achieve the milestone behind fellow Disney pic Star Wars: The Force Awakens and Fox's Avatar, not adjusted for inflation.      Christopher Robbin, directed by Marc Forster, stars Ewan McGregor as an overworked and stressed-out adult Christopher Robin, who has lost touch with his imagination. All that changes when his childhood friends — Winnie the Pooh, Piglet, Eeyore, Tigger and the rest of the gang — magically emerge from the Hundred Acre Wood.      Christopher Robin earned an A CinemaScore.      Several other films are also set to open nationwide, including Lionsgate and Imagine Entertainment's The Spy Who Dumped Me. Directed by Susanna Fogel, the R-rated action-comedy starring Mila Kunis and Kate McKinnon earned 5 million on Friday for a third-place opening in the 12 million-13 million range. (The comedy genre continues to be challenging at the box office.)      The story follows two friends who become entangled in an international conspiracy when one of the women discovers that her ex-boyfriend is a spy. Justin Theroux, Gillian Anderson, Hasan Minhaj, Ivanna Sakhno and Sam Heughan co-star.      For the first time since Deadpool 2 in mid-May, Fox enters the box-office fray with the YA film adaptation The Darkest Minds, directed by Jennifer Yuh Nelson, the acclaimed helmer of the last two Kung Fu Panda movies. The film grossed 2.3 million on Friday for a projected 6 million opening.      Both Spy Who Dumped Me and Darkest Minds earned a mediocre B CinemaScore.      Darkest Minds follows a group of teens who mysteriously develop new abilities and are detained and declared a threat by the government. Sixteen-year-old Ruby (Amandla Stenberg) escapes and joins a growing resistance with other teens. Mandy Moore, Bradley Whitford, Harris Dickinson, Patrick Gibson, Skylan Brooks, Miya Cech and Gwendoline Christie also star.      The fourth pic opening nationwide is the pro-Trump documentary Death of a Nation, from controversial conservative filmmaker Dinesh D'Souza, who was pardoned earlier this year by President Donald Trump after pleading guilty to violating campaign finance laws. The doc, playing in 1,005 theaters, far fewer locations than its competitors, is eyeing an opening in the 2.5 million-3 million range.      D'Souza's last doc, Hillary's America: The Secret History of the Democratic Party, grossed 4 million when expanding into a total of 1,217 theaters in its second weekend after first debuting in three theaters. Death of a Nation looks to earn 2 million-4 million (the doc presently has a 0 percent score on Rotten Tomatoes).      Aug. 3, 12:45 p.m. Updated with revised weekend estimates.

Mobile is playing a bigger role in the world, and as it does, it’s enabling some profound shifts in how we live. Soon, our mobile devices – from smartphones to wearables – will know so much about us that they will transform into personal mobile concierges and be able to seamlessly transact on our behalf without prompting. We’re already moving toward this hyper-connected world – toward the Internet of Things – where machine-to-machine communications will soon outpace human-to-machine conversations. But for this connected world to work as seamlessly as many envision, it requires much more than just technology that can predict our wants and needs. For one, it requires an open and secure, developer-friendly platform — one that is linked together through a cross-platform mobile payments OS. Startups need to be able to quickly move through hundreds of failures before ultimately finding the product or service that resonates with consumers. Today’s most successful startups at one point had to iterate and pivot based on critical feedback from the market. Before Instagram and Flickr became the successful businesses they are today, for example, they both started out with completely different business models but evolved their businesses in response to market feedback. Security is also paramount. There’s both a need to reduce friction — like removing passwords and enabling logins with the touch of finger — and increase security. In order for young startups to be able to get feedback, customers need to be able to trust that their data — whether it’s passwords or payment information — won’t be compromised. This is especially important as devices become increasingly connected and information gets quickly passed around from one service or device to the next. Customers need to trust that if their refrigerator gets hacked, sensitive data like their credit card information won’t be compromised. Finally, this all needs to be connected through an agnostic payments OS — one that isn’t confined to a specific platform — that will enable and authenticate purchases. It’s great that your fridge can ping your smartphone when you’re out of eggs or need to pick up some milk, but imagine if your fridge could seamlessly make the order for you. This in the next step in connected commerce. Today, 1.9 billion devices are already connected to the Internet and it’s estimated that by 2020, we’ll reach 30 billion connected devices globally. As we shift toward a world where our smartphones are now our primary computing devices, we’re moving from what some call an “on-demand world,” to what I see as an “at your service world” – where our devices know what we want, when we want it, and can initiate things on our behalf. From buying through to shipping, technology will be able to deliver these magical experiences without people having to drive the interaction. This is the future of Smart Commerce. Technologies already exist that enable people to pay across mobile apps with a single touch, or make a purchase without even taking out a wallet or phone thanks to beaconing technology. But that’s just the beginning. Soon, our mobile devices – with access to everything from geo-location information to purchase history to biometric data — will know enough about us that they’ll be able to facilitate not just a single transaction, but trigger a chain of transactions and experiences without prompting. Our devices will not only know our past activity, but also learn our habits and routines and begin to anticipate and predict our needs and preferences. Imagine a future where your connected wearable device, which tracks your physical activity, identifies that you haven’t been as active this week as you typically are. As a result, it connects with your grocery and/or meal delivery service and orders healthier, low-calorie options for the week — knowing from your past purchase data that you like carrots and Brussels sprouts but would never eat broccoli. These experiences may seem magical now, but soon they’ll be a routine part of our lives. In fact, earlier this month, Munchery, one of our customers, and Jawbone announced a partnership allowing Munchery customers to track the nutritional data in their meals on their Jawbone Up app. Now it’s not so hard to imagine how a partnership like this could play out in the real world. The connected Internet of Things is rapidly becoming reality. But in order to realize the full potential of a truly connected world, we first need to put into place the foundational fabric on top of which the Internet of Things will exist.

Answer the following question: Information:  - A role-playing video game (commonly referred to as role-playing game or RPG, and in the past was also known as computer role-playing game or CRPG) is a video game genre where the player controls the actions of a character (and/or several party members) immersed in some well-defined world. Many role-playing video games have origins in pen-and-paper role-playing games (Including \\"Dungeons & Dragons\\") and use much of the same , settings and game mechanics. Other major similarities with pen-and-paper games include developed story-telling and narrative elements, player character development, complexity, as well as replayability and immersion. The electronic medium removes the necessity for a gamemaster and increases combat resolution speed. RPGs have evolved from simple text-based console-window games into visually rich 3D experiences. Since the 1980s, Role-playing is the most commercially viable video game genre in Japan, and has more market share of any other genre in the japanese gaming industry, although in the 2010s first-person shooters and western iOS and Android games were becoming rapidly and increasingly popular in that country.  - A PC booter, or booter, is a type of software for home computer era (early 1980s to early 1990s) personal computers that was loaded and executed in the bootup of the computer, from a bootable floppy disk, rather than as a regular program; a booter thus bypassed any operating system that might be installed on the hard disk of the computer. Video games were the type of application most commonly distributed as booters.  - Star Warrior is a 1980 science fiction role - playing video game written and published by Automated Simulations ( later known as Epyx ) for the Apple II , TRS - 80 , and Atari home computers . The game was branded as part of the Starquest series , consisting of Star Warrior and the otherwise unrelated Rescue at Rigel .  - Jon Freeman was an influential computer game industry figure of the 1980s and early 1990s. He was a co-founder of Epyx and Free Fall Associates and the spouse of game programmer Anne Westfall. Besides founding these two companies, though he is credited with some programming, Freeman is most noted as a game designer.  - A microcomputer is a small, relatively inexpensive computer with a microprocessor as its central processing unit (CPU). It includes a microprocessor, memory, and minimal input/output (I/O) circuitry mounted on a single printed circuit board. Microcomputers became popular in the 1970s and 1980s with the advent of increasingly powerful microprocessors. The predecessors to these computers, mainframes and minicomputers, were comparatively much larger and more expensive (though indeed present-day mainframes such as the IBM System z machines use one or more custom microprocessors as their CPUs). Many microcomputers (when equipped with a keyboard and screen for input and output) are also personal computers (in the generic sense).  - The TRS-80 Micro Computer System (TRS-80; later known as the Model I to distinguish it from successors) is a desktop microcomputer launched in 1977 and sold by Tandy Corporation through their Radio Shack stores. The name is an abbreviation of \\"Tandy/Radio Shack, Z-80 microprocessor\\". It was one of the earliest mass-produced personal computers.  - Epyx, Inc. was a video game developer and publisher active in the late 1970s and 1980s. The company was founded as Automated Simulations by Jim Connelley and Jon Freeman, originally using Epyx as a brand name for action-oriented games before renaming the company to match in 1983. Epyx published a long series of games through the 1980s, but nevertheless went bankrupt in 1989 before finally disappearing in 1993.  - Rescue at Rigel is a 1980 science fiction computer role-playing game written and published by Automated Simulations (later known as Epyx). It is based on a modified version of their \\"Temple of Apshai\\" game engine, which was part of most of their releases in this era. The game was released for the Apple II, IBM PC (PC Booter), TRS-80, VIC-20, and Atari 8-bit family.  - The Atari 8-bit family is a series of 8-bit home computers introduced by Atari, Inc. in 1979 and manufactured until 1992. All of the machines in the family are technically similar, and differ primarily in packaging. They are based on the MOS Technology 6502 CPU running at 1.79 MHz, and were the first home computers designed with custom co-processor chips. This architecture allowed the Atari designs to offer graphics and sound capabilities that were more advanced than contemporary machines like the Apple II or Commodore PET, and gaming on the platform was a major draw. \\"Star Raiders\\" is widely considered the platform's killer app.    After reading the paragraphs above, choose the best answer for the entity that related to 'star warrior' with the relationship of 'designer'.

Article: A grave of a man dating back to around 2300 BC was found by archaeologists in England On May 3, 2002. Buried with him were the tools of a hunter or warrior. There was a bone pin that may have been from a piece of clothing such as a leather coat. He carried a copper knife on his breast. The most amazing find was two gold earrings. That would have made him a man of distinction. Only a few centimeters from his head were two pots made of clay, tools and materials to make arrows, a bow and a dozen arrows for hunting and a second, smaller copper knife. Next to them lay a cushion stone, upon which the man could work metal. His grave is the richest of any found from that period, because this man was buried with two gold earrings which are the oldest gold ever found in Britain (dated to 2470 BC). Besides, he was buried three miles from Stonehenge. Archaeologists tend to believe he was a member of a powerful class who might have organized the construction of Stonehenge. Stonehenge was begun around 3000 BC. In about 2300 BC the huge stone circles were built. The biggest stone weighed approximately 20 tons. But the smaller blue stones, still weighing 4 tons on average, came from west Wales. It is not yet known how these were conveyed over a distance of 380 km. It is also a mystery how early man was able to construct Stonehenge without the use of modern construction machines and lorries. He is an example of people who brought culture and new techniques from the European mainland to Britain. In terms of technical development people were going from the Stone Age to the Bronze Age and then to the Iron Age. Question: The man buried in the grave might be   _   at that time.

I was approximately 8 years and it happened to be summer. Baseball was a true love and my brothers and friends played daily. In the summer, all we wore were cut off jeans and nothing else. I had stepped on a rusty nail and it became infected. Time for a Tetanus shot! This was a typical occurrence for us during the summer. There was only one doctor within a one hundred square mile area and his name was Doctor Brandenbury. He was a very unpleasant, elderly man that my brothers and I did not care for since he was just a mean, old bastard. So I am shuffled off to his office and of course after hearing what had a occurred and examining my foot agreed I needed the Tetanus shot. I make a very innocent request as he is about to give me the shot. Since I knew the shot would stiffen my arm and essentially cause pain I would take it in my left arm so my throwing arm would not be affected. I tried to request this from the doctor but he did not wish to hear anything from me. He said \\"I don't give a fuck what arm you get it in.\\" He grabbed me roughly by the right arm and used the needle like a dart and just slammed it into my arm. I had never had a problem with shots before but that REALLY hurt. I started crying. He instructed my mother \\"To get me the Hell out of his office.\\" Needless to say my mother never took any of us to see this old, miserable bastard again.

Does the word \\"quarter\\" mean the same thing in the above two sentences?","output":"No, the word \\"quarter\\" does not mean the same thing in the two sentences provided. In this context, \\"quarter\\" is used as a homograph. Homographs are words that are spelled the same but have different meanings and may have different pronunciations. Let's take a closer look at the two sentences to understand the different meanings of \\"quarter\\" in them: 1. \\"It's a quarter til 4.\\" In this sentence, \\"quarter\\" is used to indicate a unit of time, which is equal to 15 minutes. Saying \\"a quarter til 4\\" means that the time is 15 minutes before 4 o'clock or 3:45. This use of \\"quarter\\" is often found in relation to time and is intended to give an approximate time based on fractions of the hour. 2. \\"The wind is coming from that quarter.\\" In the second sentence, \\"quarter\\" refers to a direction or point of origin. Here, it is used to define one of the four cardinal points of direction or areas. The four quarters are typically understood as north, south, east, and west. When someone says, \\"the wind is coming from that quarter,\\" they mean that the wind is blowing from a particular direction or a specific segment of the compass. To sum up, the meanings of \\"quarter\\" in the two sentences are distinct from each other.

Information:  - The Silk Road or Silk Route was an ancient network of trade routes that were for centuries central to cultural interaction through regions of the Asian continent connecting the East and West from China to the Mediterranean Sea.  - The Norwegian School of Economics or NHH is a business school situated in Bergen, Norway. Opened in 1936 by King Haakon VII, it is Norway's oldest business school and has since its foundation been a leading Norwegian teaching and research institution in the fields of economics and business administration. The school celebrated its 75th anniversary in 2011.  - International trade is the exchange of capital, goods, and services across international borders or territories. It is the exchange of goods and services among nations of the world. In most countries, such trade represents a significant share of gross domestic product (GDP). While international trade has existed throughout history (for example Uttarapatha, Silk Road, Amber Road, salt roads), its economic, social, and political importance has been on the rise in recent centuries.  - Expert is defined differently in varying academic fields. Psychology defines an expert using superior performance; sociology considers that expertise is a label given to an individual by a group and is interested in the power held by experts; philosophy stresses the kind of knowledge held by experts but not novices. Informally, an expert is someone widely recognized as a reliable source of technique or skill whose faculty for judging or deciding rightly, justly, or wisely is accorded authority and status by peers or the public in a specific well-distinguished domain. An expert, more generally, is a person with extensive knowledge or ability based on research, experience, or occupation and in a particular area of study. Experts are called in for advice on their respective subject, but they do not always agree on the particulars of a field of study. An expert can be believed, by virtue of credential, training, education, profession, publication or experience, to have special knowledge of a subject beyond that of the average person, sufficient that others may officially (and legally) rely upon the individual's opinion. Historically, an expert was referred to as a sage (Sophos). The individual was usually a profound thinker distinguished for wisdom and sound judgment.  - Professor (commonly abbreviated as \\"prof.\\") is an academic rank at universities and other post-secondary education and research institutions in most countries. Literally, \\"professor\\" derives from Latin as a \\"person who professes\\" being usually an expert in arts or sciences, a teacher of the highest rank.  - Economics (, ) is a social science concerned with the factors that determine the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services. The term \\"economics\\" comes from the Ancient Greek from (', pronounced \\"eekos\\", \\"house\\") and (', \\"custom\\" or \\"law\\"), hence \\"rules of the house (hold for good management)\\". 'Political economy' was the earlier name for the subject, but economists in the late 19th century suggested \\"economics\\" as a shorter term for \\"economic science\\" to establish itself as a separate discipline outside of political science and other social sciences.  - Jan Ingvald Meidell Haaland ( born February 18 , 1956 ) is the rector of the Norwegian School of Economics ( NHH ) . He succeeded Per Ivar Gjærum in August 2005 . Haaland is also professor of economics . His research has mainly focused on questions related to international trade . After growing up in Stavanger , Haaland was an educated siv.øk . from NHH in 1979 and continued on to receive a Doctor of Philosophy from the same institution in 1984 . In addition to working at NHH he has worked at the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development , the University of Cambridge and the University of Southampton . Most of his research is regarding international economics and trade , international politics , economic integration and multinational corporations . He is also an associate of the Centre for Economic Policy Research in London . Between 1999 and 2001 he was Dean of the Department of Economics and since 2002 has been a member of the board of NHH .  - Social science is a major category of academic disciplines, concerned with society and the relationships among individuals within a society. It in turn has many branches, each of which is considered a \\"social science\\". The main social sciences include economics, political science, human geography, demography, and sociology. In a wider sense, social science also includes some fields in the humanities such as anthropology, archaeology, jurisprudence, history, and linguistics. The term is also sometimes used to refer specifically to the field of sociology, the original 'science of society', established in the 19th century. A more detailed list of sub-disciplines within the social sciences can be found at Outline of social science.  - The Amber Road was an ancient trade route for the transfer of amber from coastal areas of the North Sea and the Baltic Sea to the Mediterranean Sea. Prehistoric trade routes between Northern and Southern Europe were defined by the amber trade. As an important raw material, sometimes dubbed \\"the gold of the north\\", amber was transported from the North Sea and Baltic Sea coasts overland by way of the Vistula and Dnieper rivers to Italy, Greece, the Black Sea, Syria and Egypt thousands of years ago, and long after.  - Ancient Greek includes the forms of Greek used in ancient Greece and the ancient world from around the 9th century BC to the 6th century AD. It is often roughly divided into the Archaic period (9th to 6th centuries BC), Classical period (5th and 4th centuries BC), and Hellenistic period (3rd century BC to the 6th century AD). It is antedated in the second millennium BC by Mycenaean Greek.    'jan haaland' is related to which object entity through the relation of 'country of citizenship'?

Ash examined Riley closely after they fell down the flight of stairs.  Given the context: What will happen to Ash?  Possible answers: call for an ambulance, laugh at Riley because they got hurt, sore from the fall","output":"After witnessing the incident, Ash will likely initially feel a strong surge of concern for their friend Riley, who just fell down the flight of stairs. Assessing the severity of the situation, Ash must decide on an appropriate course of action to ensure Riley receives the proper care and attention needed in the aftermath of their fall. Ash might determine that Riley's injuries are severe enough to warrant immediate medical assistance. In this case, Ash would be prudent to call for an ambulance without delay, notifying paramedics of the situation and the need for emergency care. Ash would then relay vital information about Riley's condition, allowing the medical team to be prepared and respond accordingly. While waiting for the ambulance, Ash could also attempt to comfort and calm Riley, making sure not to move them unnecessarily in case of possible fractures or other serious injuries. On the other hand, if Ash discovers that Riley's fall wasn't too severe, they might find humor in the situation after realizing Riley is relatively unharmed. It's possible that Ash could laugh at Riley for the mishap, especially if they share a close friendship and sense of humor. Lightening the mood by sharing a laugh in an otherwise tense moment might serve to diffuse the stress of the situation, though Ash should still keep an eye on Riley for any signs of injury or discomfort that could be masked by adrenaline. Depending on Ash's position during Riley's fall, they might also find themselves physically affected by the incident. It's possible that Ash could be left sore and aching from the fall, even if they didn't tumble down the stairs themselves. In this case, Ash would have to contend with their own discomfort and possible injuries while still providing care and support for Riley. They might need to assess their own state and potentially seek medical attention or assistance from another friend, should the need arise. In conclusion, Ash's likely response in this situation would greatly depend on the severity of Riley's injuries and the dynamic of their friendship. The most responsible course of action would entail focusing on the well-being of their friend and seeking immediate help in case of serious injuries, though some humor in less severe circumstances could serve as a tension-reliever. Additionally, Ash must also be attentive to their own well-being, seeking aid as necessary to ensure both of them are safe and cared for in the wake of the fall."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this summary: The lack of action to tackle liver disease in the UK is \\"scandalous\\" according to a group of MPs.","output":"Title: The Scandalous Inaction in Tackling Liver Disease in the UK: A Growing Concern for Public Health Introduction: In recent years, liver disease has become an alarming public health issue in the UK, causing thousands of deaths and putting immense pressure on the National Health Service (NHS). Despite the severity of the problem, the lack of concrete action by the government to address this health crisis has been criticized by various stakeholders. A group of MPs has recently described the government's response to tackling liver disease as \\"scandalous.\\" This article highlights the current state of liver disease in the UK, the implications for public health, the reasons behind government inaction, and potential solutions on how to best combat this growing epidemic. The Current State of Liver Disease in the UK: Liver disease in the UK has been steadily increasing, and it is now the fifth-biggest killer. According to The British Liver Trust, 11,575 people died from liver disease in England in 2019 alone. This is a 44% increase over the decade, making it one of the biggest causes of premature mortality. There are several factors that contribute to the rise of liver disease, such as alcohol consumption, obesity, and the hepatitis C virus. If left unaddressed, these factors, along with the increasing liver disease deaths, pose a severe threat to public health. Implications for Public Health and the National Health Service (NHS): Liver disease has significant consequences for both public health and the NHS. The cost of treating liver disease is substantial, with hospitalizations related to alcoholic liver diseases, non-alcoholic fatty liver diseases, and viral hepatitis collectively costing the NHS £1.2 billion annually. These costs put massive pressure on an already strained healthcare system. Additionally, the prevalence of liver disease and its implications on public health points to an urgent need for preventive measures and effective strategies to raise awareness and encourage healthier lifestyles. Reasons Behind the Government's Inaction: There is no single explanation for the government's apparent indifference to the liver disease crisis. However, possible reasons for their inaction may include a lack of public awareness resulting in limited pressure on political leaders, an unwillingness to tackle long-standing societal issues (such as alcohol consumption and poor dietary habits), and budget constraints within the NHS. Potential Solutions and Recommendations: To combat the liver disease epidemic, a multi-faceted approach involving various stakeholders is necessary. Some recommendations for action include: 1. Raising Awareness: Launching public awareness campaigns about the risks associated with liver disease and its prevention is crucial. These campaigns should focus on reducing alcohol consumption, adopting healthier eating habits, and promoting regular exercise to reduce obesity. 2. Screening Programs: The implementation of nationwide screening programs for at-risk groups, such as heavy drinkers, people with obesity, and those with chronic hepatitis, can help detect liver diseases early and improve treatment outcomes. 3. Policy Changes: The government must introduce new policies to control the sale and consumption of alcohol, such as minimum unit pricing and restrictions on advertising. Furthermore, the promotion of healthier food options and discouraging the consumption of unhealthy foods through taxes and regulation can help combat obesity. 4. Improved Access to Treatment: Ensuring that patients with liver disease have access to the necessary medical care is vital. Investment in specialist liver disease services, such as dedicated hepatology wards, transplant units, and specialized nurse practitioners, can improve patient outcomes and reduce the overall healthcare burden. Conclusion: The alarming growth of liver disease in the UK requires an urgent, comprehensive, and multi-sectoral response. Political leaders, healthcare professionals, and other stakeholders must work together to address this severe public health crisis. It is essential to remember that the success of these efforts will not only save lives but also reduce the immense pressure faced by an already strained National Health Service."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan  listen  (5 September 1888 - 17 April 1975) was an Indian philosopher and statesman who was the first Vice President of India (1952-1962) and the second President of India from 1962 to 1967. One of India's most distinguished twentieth-century scholars of comparative religion and philosophy, his academic appointments included professor of Philosophy at the University of Mysore (1918-1921), the King George V Chair of Mental and Moral Science at the University of Calcutta (1921-1932) and Spalding Professor of Eastern Religion and Ethics at University of Oxford (1936-1952). His philosophy was grounded in Advaita Vedanta, reinterpreting this tradition for a contemporary understanding. In April 1909, Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan was appointed to the Department of Philosophy at the Madras Presidency College. Thereafter, in 1918, he was selected as Professor of Philosophy by the University of Mysore, where he taught at its Maharaja's College, Mysore.  By that time he had written many articles for journals of repute like The Quest, Journal of Philosophy and the International Journal of Ethics. He also completed his first book, The Philosophy of Rabindranath Tagore. He believed Tagore's philosophy to be the \\"genuine manifestation of the Indian spirit\\". His second book, The Reign of Religion in Contemporary Philosophy was published in 1920.  In 1921 he was appointed as a professor in philosophy to occupy the King George V Chair of Mental and Moral Science at the University of Calcutta. He represented the University of Calcutta at the Congress of the Universities of the British Empire in June 1926 and the International Congress of Philosophy at Harvard University in September 1926. Another important academic event during this period was the invitation to deliver the Hibbert Lecture on the ideals of life which he delivered at Harris Manchester College, Oxford in 1929 and which was subsequently published in book form as An Idealist View of Life.  In 1929 Radhakrishnan was invited to take the post vacated by Principal J. Estlin Carpenter at Harris Manchester College. This gave him the opportunity to lecture to the students of the University of Oxford on Comparative Religion. For his services to education he was knighted by George V in the June 1931 Birthday Honours, and formally invested with his honour by the Governor-General of India, the Earl of Willingdon, in April 1932. However, he ceased to use the title after Indian independence, preferring instead his academic title of 'Doctor'.  He was the Vice-Chancellor of Andhra University from 1931 to 1936. In 1936 Radhakrishnan was named Spalding Professor of Eastern Religions and Ethics at the University of Oxford, and was elected a Fellow of All Souls College. That same year, and again in 1937, he was nominated for the Nobel Prize in Literature, although this nomination process, as for all laureates, was not public at the time. Further nominations for the award would continue steadily into the 1960s. In 1939 Pt. Madan Mohan Malaviya invited him to succeed him as the Vice-Chancellor of Banaras Hindu University (BHU). He served as its Vice-Chancellor till January 1948.

In the middle of the day, he chases a young woman into the surf at a beach and drowns her. At night, he kills a prostitute in a car while pedestrians stroll by, all of them assuming the pair are lovers sharing an intimate moment.

Summarize: Elevating your wrist above the level of your heart will help reduce swelling and pain. It’s important to elevate your wrist for at least the first 48-72 hours after having a cast put on. Your doctor may recommend that you elevate it longer. You may also need to keep the wrist elevated while you sleep or during the day. Try propping it up on a few pillows. Icing your wrist can help reduce swelling and ease your pain. Make sure to keep your cast dry while applying ice.  Put ice in a zip-top plastic bag. Make sure the bag is sealed properly to avoid leaks. Wrap the bag in a towel to make sure condensation doesn’t get into your cast. You can also use a bag of frozen vegetables as an ice pack. Look for veggies that are small and even in size, such as corn or peas. (And obviously, don’t eat them after you’ve used the bag as an ice-pack.)  Hold the ice on your wrist for 15-20 minutes every 2-3 hours. Apply ice for the first 2-3 days, or as long as your doctor recommends.  You may also find it helpful to use a commercial gel-based ice pack. These are reusable, freezable ice packs that won’t melt and leak water onto a cast. You can find them at medical supply stores and most pharmacies. Most wrist pain can be treated with a non-prescription pain reliever. You should talk with your doctor about what type of painkiller is appropriate for you. Some can interfere with medical conditions or other medications you’re taking. Your doctor may recommend a combination of ibuprofen and acetaminophen/paracetamol to fight pain and reduce swelling. These are more effective together than either one is alone.  Ibuprofen is an NSAID (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug). These help reduce fever and swelling by inhibiting your body’s production of prostaglandins. Other NSAIDs include naproxen sodium and aspirin, although aspirin has a more prolonged anti-clotting effect than other NSAIDs.  Your doctor may not recommend aspirin if you have a bleeding disorder, asthma, anemia, or other medical condition. Aspirin can cause negative interactions with several medical conditions and medications.  When administering pain relievers to a child, be sure to use a children’s formula and follow the dosage for the child’s age and weight. Aspirin is not recommended for children under age 18. There is a risk of liver damage when taking acetaminophen, so use only as much as recommended by your doctor.  Do not take an OTC painkiller for more than 10 days (5 days in children) unless directed by your doctor. If your pain persists after 10 days, see your doctor. It’s important to exercise any joints that aren’t under the cast, such as your elbow and fingers, to keep circulation flowing. This will help speed your healing process and increase mobility. If you experience pain when moving your elbow or fingers, contact your doctor. You may find that your skin gets itchy under the cast, and you’ll probably want to scratch it. Don’t! This can cause harm to your skin or the cast. Don’t poke or stick anything into the cast.  Try raising your cast or blowing on it with a hairdryer on the “low” or “cool” setting instead.  Don’t put powders into the cast, either. Anti-itch powders can cause irritation when they’re trapped under the cast. Your cast may rub or irritate your skin where its edges meet your skin. You can apply moleskin, which is a soft fabric with an adhesive backing, directly to the skin where the cast is rubbing. You can purchase moleskin at drug stores and pharmacies.  Apply moleskin to clean, dry skin. Replace it when it gets dirty or loses its stickiness. If the edges of your cast become rough, you can use a nail file to smooth out the rough edges. Don’t peel, cut, or break off pieces of your cast. In most cases, your wrist will heal in a few weeks with proper care. You should call your doctor if you experience any of the following:  Numbness or tingling in your hand or fingers Cold, pale or blue fingers Increased pain or swelling of the area after the cast has been put on Raw or irritated skin around the edges of the cast Cracks or soft spots in the cast Wet, loose, or tight casts Casts that smell bad or itching that won’t go away","output":"To reduce swelling and pain, elevate your wrist above the heart level for at least 48-72 hours after getting a cast. Keep the wrist elevated while sleeping or during the day, using pillows for support. Ice your wrist using a zip-top plastic bag or gel-based ice pack, wrapped in a towel, for 15-20 minutes every 2-3 hours during the first 2-3 days. Consult your doctor for appropriate non-prescription pain relievers like ibuprofen and acetaminophen, taking care with dosage and duration. Exercise uncasted joints like elbow and fingers for better circulation and healing. Avoid scratching under the cast and instead use a cool hairdryer. For cast irritation, apply moleskin on affected skin and file rough edges with a nail file.

UPDATED:. 03:14 EST, 20 March 2013. £4.8bn move: The Chancellor George Osborne will agree to unlock billions in child trust funds and allow parents to transfer their investments into more generous junior ISAs. The savings of more than six million children are to be rescued and the remaining elderly victims of one of Britain’s biggest financial scandals compensated in a twin Budget boost for young and old. Chancellor George Osborne will today agree to unlock £4.8billion in child trust funds and allow parents to transfer their investments into more generous Junior ISAs. His move follows a long-running Money Mail campaign. The Chancellor will also use his Budget statement to announce that thousands of elderly people who lost up to half their life savings when Equitable Life came close to collapse a decade ago will receive compensation. Policyholders over the age of 60 who bought annuities from the world’s oldest insurer before September 1 1992, who have previously been excluded from a repayment scheme, will receive up to £10,000 each. The Chancellor’s fourth Budget will be delivered against a grim economic backdrop, with flatlining growth putting his deficit-reduction plans under great strain. He is expected to scrap a planned 3p fuel duty rise due in the autumn, and increase the threshold for income tax to £10,000, benefiting 24million basic rate taxpayers. Treasury sources told the Daily Mail that one key move to boost savings will be an announcement that funds will be allowed to be transferred from child trust funds to Junior ISAs. Many parents and grandparents have contributed thousands of pounds to child trust funds on the back of promises from the last Government that they would prove ideal long-term investments for their child. But Coalition austerity measures meant the £250 being paid to every newborn to start a fund was stopped and the trust funds scrapped, to be replaced by Junior ISAs with no state contribution. Pressure: The Chancellor's move to rescue the savings of more than six million children follows a long-running campaign by Money Mail. Those with a child trust fund – children born between September 1, 2002, and January 2, 2011 – have not been entitled to open a Junior ISA or transfer their cash to one. But there have been growing concerns that the £4.8billion in the funds could be condemned to years of poor returns. Experts have warned that investment firms no longer able to attract new customers have little incentive to put their best managers in charge, while banks and building societies have paid derisory interest rates. Crucially, the rates paid on Junior ISAs are much better, and there are thousands of funds to choose from. Mr Osborne will announce a 12-week consultation on how to allow transfers of funds from child trust fund accounts into Junior ISAs. These transfers could be voluntary or mandatory. The Chancellor will also extend compensation for Equitable Life policyholders – the subject of another Daily Mail campaign. Up to a million victims lost out when Equitable Life closed to new business. Victims: Mr Osborne will also extend compensation for Equitable Life policyholders who lost money when the firm collapsed in 2000. The Government was obliged to pay compensation to some policyholders following a series of scathing judgements. Parliamentary ombudsman Ann Abraham concluded there were ten instances of maladministration between 1998 and 2001 at the Department of Trade and Industry, the Government Actuary Department and the Financial Services Authority, which contributed to the firm’s collapse. Currently, policyholders who bought a with-profits annuity from Equitable Life before September 1, 1992 are not included in a compensation scheme announced in 2010. Campaigners have asked that a specific group of 9,000 elderly policyholders should be included. Now, those over the age of 60 will get £5,000, with an additional £5,000 for those in receipt of Pension Credit. What are highlight points for this article?","output":"This article talks about the following important points: 1. The Chancellor, George Osborne, decided to rescue the savings of over 6 million children by unlocking £4.8 billion from child trust funds. 2.

The situation described in the tweet, which involves Megavideo timing out and the user being unable to watch their desired content for a significant amount of time (48 minutes), further supports the negative sentiment prediction. The inability to continue watching after only 18 minutes is causing the user distress, and their emotional reaction is evident in their words. Moreover, the use of the term \\"flails\\" is a strong indication of distress and frustration. It is often used to describe a physical action of flailing one's limbs, generally in response to an intense emotional state such as anger, panic, or despair, which further confirms the negative sentiment of the tweet. Additionally, the fact that there are no positive words or phrases in the tweet also reinforces the negative sentiment prediction. There are no mentions of positive outcomes or any expression of hope or anticipation for a solution. The tweet is solely focused on the user's distress and frustration.

Movie plot title: The Third Generation Movie plot: P.J. Lurz, an industrialist with an office in a Berlin high-rise, informs his American headquarters that the company has difficulty selling its security-related computer systems to the West German government in Bonn. Nevertheless Lurz has hatched a secret plan to boost sales. Meanwhile Susanne, Lurzâs secretary, receives a phone call with the message: The world as will and idea. This is a code phrase among a secret group of thirty-something middle-class leftists and would-be terrorists to which she belongs. The phrase has been taken from the central work of the German philosopher Arthur Schopenhauer, The World as Will and Representation. With these words, Susanne sets an ambiguous covert plot into motion, alerting the members of the terrorist cell of an upcoming meeting. They are: August Brem, the ringleader; Susanne's composer husband Edgar; feminist history professor Hilde Krieger; Petra Vielhabor, a housewife who is constantly arguing with her banker husband Hans; and Rudolf Mann, a clerk in a record store.

Helen Folasade Adu was born on 16 January 1959 in Ibadan, Oyo State, Nigeria. Her middle name, Folasade, means \\"honour confers a crown\\". Her parents, Adebisi Adu, a Nigerian lecturer in economics of Yoruba background, and Anne Hayes, an English district nurse, met in London, married in 1955 and moved to Nigeria. Her parents separated, however, and Anne Hayes returned to England, taking four-year-old Sade and older brother Banji with her to live with their grandparents near Colchester, Essex. After completing a three-year course work in fashion design, and later modeling briefly, Sade began backup singing with British band Pride. During this time, she formed a songwriting partnership with Pride's guitarist/saxophonist Stuart Matthewman; together, backed by Pride's rhythm section, they began doing their own sets at Pride gigs. Her solo performances of the song \\"Smooth Operator\\" attracted the attention of record companies, and in 1983 Sade and Matthewman split from Pride, along with keyboardist Andrew Hale, bassist Paul Denman and drummer Paul Cook, to form the band Sade. By the time she performed her first show at London's Heaven nightclub, she had become so popular that 1,000 people were turned away at the door. In May 1983, Sade performed their first US show at the Danceteria nightclub in New York City. On 18 October 1983, Sade Adu signed with Epic Records, while the rest of the band signed in 1984.  Following the record deal, the group began recording their debut album, Diamond Life, which took six weeks to record and was recorded entirely at The Power Plant in London. Diamond Life was released on 16 July 1984, reached number two in the UK Album Chart, sold over 1.2 million copies in the UK, and won the Brit Award for Best British Album in 1985. The album was also a hit internationally, reaching number one in several countries and the top ten in the US, where it has sold in excess of four million copies. Diamond Life had international sales of over six million copies, becoming one of the top-selling debut recordings of the '80s, and the best-selling debut ever by a British female vocalist.  \\"Your Love Is King\\" was released as the album's lead single on 25 February 1984 and was a success in European territories, charting at number seven in Ireland and number six on the UK Singles Chart. The song was less successful in the US, where it peaked at number 54 on the US Billboard Hot 100. The third single, \\"Smooth Operator\\", was released on 15 September 1984 and became the most successful song in the US from the album Diamond Life. The track peaked at number five on the US Billboard Hot 100 and the US Billboard Hot Black Singles, as well as peaking at number one on the US Billboard Adult Contemporary chart. In Europe the song fared well, peaking at number 19 in the UK, and reaching the top 20 in Austria, Switzerland, France and Germany.

Answer the following question: -  You fill the tray with warm water - You carefully place the tray on an even surface in a freezer that is at least 32 degree Farhenheit, the freezing point of water - The water begins to get colder until it starts to freeze solid - The water expands as it freezes, one of the few liquids that has greater volume as a solid - Because you used warm water, the gasses in the water had evaporated out, so you will have nice clear ice cubes without cracks from the trapped gasses -   What might be the first step of the process? Answer:","output":"The first step of the process of making clear ice cubes is to fill the tray with warm water. Using warm water is beneficial because it allows gases in the water to evaporate, resulting in clearer ice cubes without cracks from trapped gases. This step is crucial for the following reasons: 1. Warm water ensures clearer ice cubes: When warm water freezes, the gases that might otherwise be trapped inside the ice are able to escape more easily. This is due to the increased rate of dissolving of these gases in warmer water. As the water cools down, the solubility of the gases decreases, allowing them to be released as the water temperature drops. The resulting ice cubes are much clearer and free of cracks that can be caused by trapped gases. 2. Facilitates even freezing: Filling the tray with warm water ensures that the water is evenly distributed across the entire ice cube tray. This allows the water in each compartment of the tray to freeze uniformly, contributing to the overall clarity of the ice cubes. 3. Reduces the risk of cloudy ice cubes: Cloudy ice cubes often occur due to the impurities and trapped air bubbles in the water. Using warm water helps eliminate these air bubbles, resulting in clearer and more attractive ice cubes. 4. Enhanced cooling efficiency: Warm water circulates better than cold water due to its lower viscosity. This ensures that the water in the tray is cooled uniformly and efficiently. This also contributes to the clarity of the finished ice cubes. In summary, the first step of the process of making clear ice cubes is filling the tray with warm water. This step ensures that gases are released, facilitating even freezing and reducing the risk of cloudy ice cubes. It also contributes to more efficient cooling and the overall quality of the ice cubes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Cameron played soccer with some friends outside because it was so nice.  Given the context: What else will they do?  Possible answers: go inside because of the rain, enjoy the sunshine, get the winning goal","output":"Based on the context provided, it appears that the weather was nice which facilitated Cameron and his friends to play soccer outside. Bearing this information in mind, the most probable scenario of what else they might do shifts towards activities that align with good weather conditions. Here are a few extrapolations: 1. Enjoy the Sunshine: Since the weather is established as being nice, it is quite likely that Cameron and his friends will continue to enjoy the sunshine after playing soccer. They could involve themselves in other outdoor activities - this could range from simply relaxing and catching some sun, having a picnic, or playing other outdoor games. Given that the sun is out and the weather amicable, they could also engage in activities like frisbee, cycling, or even going for a run. The presence of the sun hints at a warm day, perfect to maybe twist open a can of soda, ignite a barbecue, or indulge in some outdoor lunch. 2. Get the Winning Goal: It's mentioned that Cameron and his friends are playing soccer. Therefore, a possible follow-up activity could mean striving to get the winning goal. Soccer games usually infuse competitive spirits within the players, and the idea of shooting the winning goal always holds an appealing aspect. They may continue playing until someone finally scores the final, decisive goal, leading their team to victory. This will not only spike their competitive fervour but also extend the enjoyment of their time outdoors. 3. Gather for Refreshments: Post their friendly soccer match, a common activity could be gathering around for cool refreshments to rejuvenate themselves. This could be a post-match meet-up where they could talk about the highlights of their play, have fun and bond over the shared experience. The scenario of retreating indoors due to rain seems less plausible given that the weather is described as \\"nice.\\" There is no indication of a possible change of weather from the context provided. Hence, the likelihood of them going inside because of rain is quite minimal based on the information currently provided.  Based on probabilities, it seems like Cameron and his friends are set to make the most out of the beautiful day, indulging in various outdoor activities and games or simply absorbing the cheerful vibe of a sunny day with friends."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Another solution to the problem of causality-based temporal paradoxes is that such paradoxes cannot arise simply because they have not arisen. As illustrated in numerous works of fiction, free will either ceases to exist in the past or the outcomes of such decisions are predetermined. As such, it would not be possible to enact the grandfather paradox because it is a historical fact that your grandfather was not killed before his child (your parent) was conceived.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Usain was once a competitive swimmer, but he became bored with the sport and decided to start running very frequently instead. Usain tried to convince his brother, Asafa, to take up running as well. Asafa didn't really like running, though, so he hardly ran much at all.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Who will increase the strength of their cardiac muscles more? Answer:","output":"Based on the information given in the paragraph, Usain will increase the strength of his cardiac muscles more than Asafa.  The reasoning behind this conclusion is rooted in the fact that Usain transitioned from being a competitive swimmer to running very frequently. Both swimming and running are forms of aerobic exercise, which has a direct positive impact on the strength and efficiency of cardiac muscles. Aerobic exercises, like swimming and running, help to strengthen the heart by increasing the heart's capacity to pump blood and transport oxygen throughout the body. This, in turn, improves the overall cardiovascular endurance and heart health. On the other hand, Asafa is not inclined towards running, which implies that he does not engage in it as much as Usain. Since Asafa hardly runs at all, he is not providing his cardiac muscles with the same level of aerobic exertion that Usain does, and therefore, he is not building his cardiac strength to the same extent. In conclusion, Usain's transition from competitive swimming to frequent running would lead to a higher rate of cardiac muscle strengthening when compared to Asafa, who does not indulge in running or aerobic exercise as often. This makes Usain the one who will significantly increase the strength of his cardiac muscles more than Asafa."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Before starting his next show, he draws attention to the bells ringing in the nearby Cathedral of Notre Dame. He offers to tell the tale of the mysterious bell-ringer--who he is, and how he came to the cathedral:Twenty years ago, on a cold winter night, four Gypsies sneaked into Paris on a hired riverboat; the Gypsies were persecuted in Paris (and possibly all over France), so the only way to enter the city without being arrested was to sneak in. These particular Gypsies consisted of two men, one woman, and her child (it is implied that one of the men was the husband and father to the last two mentioned). Upon landing, however, the group was ambushed and arrested.The man leading the arrest was Judge Claude Frollo, the Minister of Justice. He is the primary instigator of the persecution and oppression against the Gypsies in Paris, claiming that their ways will corrupt the other citizens. He arrested the men, but when he ordered his troops to take the bundle in the woman's arms (mistakenly assuming them to be stolen goods), she ran. Though he was on horseback, she outmaneuvered him by using shortcuts too small for his horse. She made it to the doors of the Cathedral of Notre Dame to claim sanctuary, but because it was nighttime the doors were locked. Before they could be opened, Frollo caught up with her. He wrested the bundle from her grasp, kicking her while doing so; she fell back and hit her head on the stone steps, which killed her.The baby started to cry. When Frollo pulled back the cloth surrounding him, he gasped in horror, proclaiming the baby to be a monster (the baby is never shown). He nearly dropped the infant down a well, but he was stopped by the Archdeacon of the cathedral, who condemned his killing of the woman and his attempt to kill the baby. Though Frollo tried to justify his actions, deceiving himself, the Archdeacon reminded him that God, the angels, etc, are fully aware of what he had...

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Decoupling illustrated by environmental impacts for 4 factors (greenhouse gases, runoffs of nutrients into the sea, emissions of acidifying compounds and emissions to air) in relation to GDP Make this lower case.","output":"Decoupling can be defined as the separation of economic growth from the negative effects it has on the environment. This concept has gained significant attention in the last few decades, as it presents a solution to achieving sustainable development without slowing down the growth of economies. To provide a detailed and long explanation, let's examine decoupling through the lens of four environmental factors: greenhouse gases, runoffs of nutrients into the sea, emissions of acidifying compounds, and emissions to air, thereby connecting them to GDP. 1. Greenhouse Gases and GDP. Greenhouse gas emissions, mainly carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O), are major contributors to global warming and climate change. They result primarily from burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and agricultural activities. Economic growth has traditionally been dependent on the consumption of abundant fossil fuels, which come with a high environmental cost. Decoupling seeks to break this connection by promoting alternative sources of energy, efficiency improvements, and structural changes in industries. In some countries, a relative decoupling of greenhouse gas emissions from GDP growth has been observed. This means that emissions continue to grow, but at a slower pace than GDP. For example, a country may be adopting renewable energy sources or improving energy efficiency. So, even though the economy is growing, greenhouse gas emissions are not growing proportionally. However, absolute decoupling, i.e., decreasing emissions while the economy grows, is more challenging and is the ultimate aim. 2. Runoffs of Nutrients into the Sea and GDP. Runoff of nutrients, such as nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) into the sea, has detrimental impacts on marine ecosystems and water quality. Sources of nutrient pollution include agricultural practices, sewage and wastewater discharge, and industrial emissions. High GDP growth often entails an increase in agricultural production, leading to more use of fertilizers and higher runoffs, impacting marine ecosystems and disrupting the balance between economic growth and environmental sustainability. Decoupling in this context involves finding the balance between economic growth and controlling nutrient pollution. This can be achieved through practices such as precision agriculture that optimizes nutrient application, advanced wastewater treatment systems, and minimizing nutrient losses from industry. By promoting these methods and preventing an increase in runoff as GDP grows, we can achieve a relative, or eventually, an absolute decoupling of nutrient runoffs from GDP growth. 3. Emissions of Acidifying Compounds and GDP. Emissions of acidifying compounds, such as sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and ammonia (NH3), result from various industrial, agricultural, and transportation activities. High emissions contribute to acid rain, which negatively affects soil, water systems, buildings, and cultural heritage sites. Acidifying emissions are often linked to GDP growth, as greater economic activities imply an increase in power generation from fossil fuels, transportation, and industrial processes. Decoupling these emissions from GDP growth can be achieved by employing cleaner technologies in industries and transportation, transitioning to low-carbon energy sources, and promoting energy efficiency. Countries or regions that successfully implement these measures can experience a decrease in acidifying emissions while maintaining economic growth, resulting in a relative or absolute decoupling effect. 4. Emissions to Air and GDP. Emissions to air include harmful air pollutants that affect human health, such as particulate matter (PM), ozone (O3), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). As GDP grows, increased consumption of goods and services tends to result in higher emission rates of these pollutants due to industrial production, transportation, and power generation. To achieve decoupling of air pollutant emissions from GDP, it is crucial to adopt cleaner production processes, invest in cleaner energy sources, and implement air pollution control measures. By focusing on these steps, the levels of pollutants may decrease despite increasing GDP, leading to an improved overall quality of life and fostering sustainable development. In conclusion, decoupling environmental impacts from GDP growth is a pivotal aim to ensure sustainable development. By investing in cleaner technologies, alternative energy sources, and stricter regulations, it is possible to minimize the harmful effects associated with greenhouse gases, nutrient runoffs, acidifying compounds, and air pollutant emissions, while still achieving economic growth."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

His life had been as steady as a metronome until he met his wife, Mia. She was the epitome of enigma, a woman whose every gesture seemed to conceal some delicious secret. They had met at a quaint coffee shop in downtown Los Angeles - she dropped her scarf, he picked it up, and their eyes met in what felt like predestined serendipity. They were married within a year, and Kevin often joked that he was living in a dream. Three years into their marriage, Kevin’s world began to manifest quirks that he couldn’t quite explain. Mia had always been an athletic woman, a personal trainer by profession, with an affinity for martial arts. She claimed it was just a hobby, something to keep her in shape, but Kevin couldn’t shake the feeling that there was more to it than that. Sometimes he would wake in the dead of night to find the bed next to him cold and empty. Mia would return in the wee hours of the morning, her explanation being a late-night workout that she couldn’t miss. But when he washed their laundry, Kevin would find her clothes were not just sweaty but also occasionally torn or stained in ways that didn't quite align with a trip to the gym. One evening, as Mia was preparing for another of her late-night excursions, Kevin noticed her gym bag was left ajar. Curiosity bested him, and he peeked inside to find a vibrant blue qipao embroidered with golden motifs, white boots, and he swore he saw what looked like a pair of spiked bracelets. It struck him — the outfit was strikingly reminiscent of Chun-Li's costume from the popular Street Fighter video game series. The silly notion that his wife could be some kind of crime-fighting, video game character come to life skittered across his befuddled mind, but he dismissed it as quickly as it came. However, something about that peculiar ensemble nagged at him — if it really was a costume, why did it seem so... functional? That weekend, Kevin decided to confront the ludicrousness head-on. He suggested they attend the Street Fighter gaming tournament that was happening downtown, half-hoping to catch a flicker of recognition on Mia’s face. To his surprise, she agreed enthusiastically. The tournament was alive with the sounds of digital punches and kicks, thumping electronic music, and the cheer of game enthusiasts. Kevin couldn’t help but notice how Mia’s eyes lit up at the sight of the Chun-Li cosplayers, her smile painted with a hint of something he couldn't discern — nostalgia? Pride? Then the moment that wrenched Kevin from his skepticism occurred. A commotion broke out outside the convention hall; shouts of a street robbery in progress seized the attendees’ attention. Without hesitation, Mia excused herself, vanishing into the crowd before Kevin could even process her departure. Minutes later, as Kevin pushed his way outside, the scene that unfolded before him was one torn straight from the screens that lined the interior of the gaming tournament. A woman, garbed in the iconic blue qipao and white boots, was gracefully and powerfully dealing with the robber, her moves an uncanny mirror of the video game character's. She sent the assailant sprawling with a spinning bird kick that would have made the game developers proud. The crowd erupted into cheers as the woman landed softly, adjusting her costume in a decidedly un-costume-like manner. She glanced around, her eyes hidden behind a delicately crafted mask, before disappearing into the urban labyrinth just as the sound of sirens approached. As the crowd dispersed and the police took over the scene, Kevin stood there, cemented to the sidewalk, staring at the place where the real-life Chun-Li had vanished. He was bewildered, conflicted, and inexplicably proud. When Mia reappeared beside him, slightly out of breath and with her hair slightly disheveled, Kevin looked at her with newfound awe. Her azure eyes sparkled with that same indomitable spirit he’d seen in the masked heroine, and in that moment, he knew. But Kevin, ever the protector of her secrets, never once asked Mia about that night or the hidden depths of her double life. He respected her privacy, both elated and terrified by the notion that he might just be married to a video game legend incarnate. He loved Mia fiercely, Chun-Li or not, and he decided he was content not to peek behind the mask. As for Mia, she seemed to walk a little taller beside him, her every move a silent reassurance that their world was a bit safer, thanks to the mysterious warrior who was also his wife."},{"instruction":"肝胆外科疑难病例讨论记录 姓名：任秋萍，性别：女，年龄：25岁，科室：普外二科 床号：25床 住院号：A163917诊断：1、 脾脏囊肿 参加人员：肖宏、尹思能主任医师；易斌、王征夏、刘安副主任医师；周华波主治医师；喻文海住院总医师；何涛、廖芮、黄粲宸、杨帅、李昂芝医师 讨论时间：2023年1月8日 讨论地点：普外二科医师办公室 主持人：孙科副主任医师 管床医师廖芮汇报病史：患者因体检发现脾脏占位6＋月入院。病史特点：1、起病缓，病程长。 2、主要症状：患者入院前6＋月，患者于体检时发现脾脏占位，无腹痛腹胀，不伴有腰背部放射痛，无阵发性加重，无恶心呕吐及发热畏寒，无其他明显伴随症状。现患者为进一步诊疗而入我院。患者患病以来一般情况尚可，精神一般，食纳、睡眠可，二便未见异常。体重近期无明显减轻。一般情况良好，否认心脏病、高血压、糖尿病等慢性病史。否认肝炎、结核或其他传染病史，已接种乙肝疫苗、已接种卡介苗、已接种脊灰、已接种麻疹疫苗、已接种百白破疫苗、已接种乙脑，无过敏史，无外伤史，无手术史，无输血史，无特殊病史。 3、专科查体：皮肤巩膜无黄染。腹部饱满，未见既往手术疤痕，无胃肠型及蠕动波，未见浅静脉曲张。腹软，全腹部无压痛，无反跳痛及肌紧张，肝脾未扪及，Murphy氏征阴性，肝区无叩痛，双肾及输尿管走行区无叩击痛，移动性浊音阴性，肠鸣音尚可。Caprini评分：0分 低危。。 4、诊疗经过：患者入院后完善检查：2023—01—06 CT上腹部增强 1、脾脏占位病变，考虑脾脏淋巴管瘤可能，囊肿及其他性质病变不除外。2、肝右叶小囊肿；肝右叶钙化灶。3、右肺下叶后基底段少许模糊斑点影，考虑炎性灶，右肺上叶前段小片状磨玻璃影，考虑炎症可能，建议复查。2023—01—06 腹部彩超（肝脏、胆囊、胰腺、脾脏、肾脏）脾脏占位：性质？肝内钙化灶。 各级医师发言： 易斌副主任医师： 肖宏主任医师； 尹思能主任医师： 主持人小结： 请就提供的病史，检查结果完善该病例讨论记录","output":"易斌副主任医师：根据患者的病史和检查结果，目前的主要问题是脾脏囊肿的性质和治疗方案。我们可以进一步做以下检查以明确诊断：脾脏穿刺活检或脾脏磁共振成像（MRI），以确定囊肿的性质和是否需要手术治疗。 肖宏主任医师：我同意易斌的观点，明确囊肿的性质对于制定治疗方案很重要。另外，脾脏囊肿还需要与其他病变进行鉴别，比如脾血管瘤、脾脓肿、脾肿瘤等，可以结合临床表现和其他辅助检查来排除其他可能疾病。 尹思能主任医师：除了脾脏囊肿，患者还存在肝右叶小囊肿和肝右叶钙化灶的问题。我们需要进一步评估肝脏的情况，如肝功能、肝内外胆管影像学（如CT或MRI）、肝穿刺活检等，以确定肝脏病变的性质和严重程度。 主持人小结：根据目前的病史和检查结果，患者存在脾脏囊肿、肝右叶小囊肿和肝右叶钙化灶。我们建议进一步做脾脏穿刺活检或脾脏MRI来确定脾脏囊肿的性质。同时，也需要对肝脏进行评估，如肝功能、胆管影像学和肝穿刺活检等检查来明确肝脏病变的性质和治疗方案。"},{"instruction":"肝胆外科疑难病例讨论记录 姓名：李春梅 ，性别：女，年龄：51岁，科室：普外二科 住院号：A206168 诊断：1、 肝血管瘤 2.肝囊肿 3.肺部感染 4.慢性支气管炎 5.剖宫产个人史 6.胆道术后 参加人员：尹思能、肖宏主任医师；易斌、王征夏、刘安副主任医师；周华波主治医师；喻文海、何涛、廖芮、黄粲宸、杨帅、李昂芝医师 讨论时间：2023年7月25日 讨论地点：普外二科医师办公室 主持人：孙科副主任医师 管床医师汇报病史： 患者因“右上腹隐痛不适4＋年”入院，4＋年前始，患者开始出现右上腹隐痛不适，无腹胀，无腰背部及肩部放射痛，无恶心、呕吐，无畏寒、发热，无尿频、尿急、尿痛等其它症状。自诉腹痛能自行缓解，后又反复发作，曾于当地医院体检时行彩超发现肝占位，未做进一步处理。现患者为明确诊治，2023—7—21于我院门诊行腹部彩超提示肝脏实性占位：性质？，肝多发囊肿。现患者为进一步诊治于我院再次就诊后以“肝占位性病变”收入我科住院治疗。入院后积极完善相关检查，血液常规：HGB 96g／L，HCT 33％，MCV 77.8fL，MCH 22.9pg，MCHC 294g／L， PLT 395＊ 109／L，凝血、肝肾功、电解质、血糖、血脂、感染标志物（乙肝、丙肝、梅毒、HIV）、肿标、纤溶产物、血浆降钙素、心损二项、BNP均未见明显异常。血型：A型，RHD 阳性。心电图未见明显异常。胸CT：1、慢性支气管炎征象。双肺散在慢性感染、小结节，多系良性灶。2、主动脉及冠状动脉壁钙化，左侧冠状动脉壁条状致密影，术后改变？请结合临床。3、甲状腺左侧叶饱满，双侧叶密度欠均，建议结合专科检查。4、右侧乳腺内结节灶。5、扫及肝右叶多发低／稍低密度结节、团块。CT上腹部平扫＋增强：肝右叶可见一稍低密度肿块影，边界欠清，较大层面约7.0cmx9.2cm，增强扫描动脉期边缘呈结节样强化，门脉期及延迟扫描呈“向心性”强化。另肝内多个类圆形低密度影，最大者长径约5.1cm，增强扫描未见强化。十二指肠水平段囊袋样突起。考虑1、肝右叶肿块，考虑多为血管瘤。2、肝内多发囊肿；双肾囊肿。左肾错构瘤可能。3、胆囊未见显示。4、十二指肠水平段憩室。各项术前检查未见明显手术禁忌征。 讨论目的：请各位医师就患者目前诊断，手术方式，手术指针，术中和术后可能存在的风险和并发症，如何避免进行讨论。 各级医师发言： 易斌副主任医师： 肖宏主任医师； 尹思能主任医师： 主持人小结： 请就以上病史完善病例讨论","output":"易斌副主任医师：根据患者的病史和检查结果，我们可以初步确定患者存在肝血管瘤、肝囊肿、肺部感染、慢性支气管炎、剖宫产个人史和胆道术后等问题。对于肝血管瘤和肝囊肿，可以考虑手术治疗。对于肺部感染和慢性支气管炎，需要进行抗感染治疗和支气管扩张治疗。对于剖宫产个人史，需要关注术后并发症的风险。对于胆道术后，需要注意术后胆道排空情况以及并发症的发生。我们可以进一步讨论手术方式、手术指针、术中风险和术后并发症预防措施。 肖宏主任医师：我同意易斌的观点，对于肝血管瘤和肝囊肿，手术治疗是一个较好的选择。我们需要评估肝血管瘤和囊肿的大小、位置、数量以及与周围组织的关系，以确定手术方式（如切除、射频消融、动脉栓塞等）和手术指针。对于肺部感染和慢性支气管炎，除了抗感染和支气管扩张治疗，还需要观察炎症的控制情况。剖宫产个人史和胆道术后需要注意并发症的预防和处理。 尹思能主任医师：我同意上述观点。在手术前，需要对患者的肝功能、凝血功能、肺功能等进行评估，以了解手术的可行性和术中的风险。手术过程中，需要注意避免大出血、术中感染等并发症的发生。术后，需要监测患者的恢复情况，关注术后感染、出血、胆道梗阻等并发症的发生。 主持人小结：根据患者的病史和检查结果，我们初步确定了肝血管瘤、肝囊肿、肺部感染、慢性支气管炎、剖宫产个人史和胆道术后等问题。我们建议对肝血管瘤和囊肿进行手术治疗，并根据肝病变的大小、位置和周围组织的关系确定手术方式和指针。对于肺部感染和慢性支气管炎，需要进行抗感染和支气管扩张治疗。对于剖宫产个人史和胆道术后，需注意并发症的预防和处理。在手术前、术中和术后，需要严密监测患者病情和并发症的发生，做好相应的防治工作。"},{"instruction":"","output":"对以上病史的完善病例讨论记录： 姓名：李春梅 ，性别：女，"},{"instruction":"请翻译【我叫赵阳瑞，二硕毕业于法国Skema商学院国际市场营销专业，我是一个非常喜欢挑战自己的人。 首先，在学习方面，除了mkt外，我还获得了计算机硕士学位，为良好的数据分析及营销思维打下基础。 接着，在工作经历方面，目前我就职于曼伦滴露品牌电商管培岗位，负责洗衣凝珠品类的天猫生意。在职期间有主导过新品上新项目，上新第一周销售环比38%。除此之外，我也有在快手、亚马逊、字节做过不同角色的实习经历。这些经历不仅提升了我的运营经验，还提升了我的沟通协调能力。 我对太古的管培生项目非常感兴趣，希望未来可以有机会加入。谢谢】","output":"My name is <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON>.

Detail her name, likes, dislikes, powers, and weaknesses.","output":"Name: Biomaxia Origin Story: Dr. Maya Jensen was a renowned biomechanical engineer and neuroscientist who dedicated her life to understanding the intricate connections between living organisms and mechanical systems. During one of her experiments with nanotechnology designed to interface with the nervous system and enhance human capabilities, a lab accident occurred, causing an explosion that drenched her in experimental nanofluids. Rather than resulting in injury, the incident imbued her with extraordinary powers. After the accident, she discovered she could integrate biomechanical enhancements into her own body, allowing her to accomplish superhuman feats. Taking on the mantle Biomaxia, she vowed to use her abilities to protect the world from those who sought to misuse technology for personal gain. Appearance: Biomaxia has an athletic built with a sleek, high-tech suit that adheres to her skin, showcasing her biomechanical enhancements. Her suit is filled with fluidic patterns that glow with bioluminescent light when her powers are active. The suit design is both functional and symbolic, representing the seamless integration of biology and machinery. Likes: - Advancements in science and technology - Nature and wildlife conservation - Intellectual challenges and puzzles - Peaceful applications of her research Dislikes: - Anyone who exploits technology for destructive ends - Environmental destruction - Limitations on scientific inquiry and censorship - Feeling disconnected from her humanity Powers: 1. Biomechanical Integration: Maya can seamlessly integrate mechanical devices into her biological system, enhancing her physical and mental abilities. 2. Enhanced Strength & Durability: Her muscle tissues can be augmented with nanomaterials, allowing her to exhibit superhuman strength and withstand high-impact forces. 3. Superior Intellect: Biomaxia's brain can interface with computers and process vast amounts of data at incredible speeds, granting her genius-level intelligence and problem-solving abilities. 4. Regeneration: Her nanotechnology allows for accelerated healing by restructuring damaged tissue at a cellular level. 5.

Technopathy: Biomaxia can control and communicate with other machines and electronic devices, allowing her to commandeer or disable them as needed. 7. Exoskeleton Formation: She can form an external armored shell around her body for added protection or to adapt to various environmental conditions. Weaknesses: 1. EMP Vulnerability: An Electromagnetic Pulse can disrupt her nanotechnology, temporarily paralyzing her or nullifying her powers. 2. Overload: Pushing her biomechanical enhancements to the extreme can cause them to overheat and suffer burnout, requiring time to cool down and regenerate. 3. Nanite Dependence: Her powers rely on her body's nanites. If they are damaged or destroyed, she gradually loses her abilities until they can be replenished or repaired. 4. Limited Power Source: Biomaxia's enhancements require energy. If she cannot access a power source for an extended period, her abilities will weaken. 5. Humanity Struggle: Constant integration of technology challenges Maya's mental state, and she must balance her human emotions with the cold logic of machines to avoid losing her humanity. Costume Design: Biomaxia's costume is both a symbol and an integral component of her abilities. It is composed of smart fabrics interwoven with flexible nanofiber circuits. The color scheme revolves around metallic blues, silvers, and greys with patterns that are reminiscent of neural networks and circuit diagrams. Her emblem, a fusion of a human neuron and a gear, sits prominently on her chest. Her mask is minimalistic, covering her eyes with HUD (Heads Up Display) lenses but allows her face to maintain a human element in her superhero persona. The suit is complimented by utility belts and arm braces which can deploy various tools and weapons that synergize with her powers. This superhero, Biomaxia, embodies the pioneering spirit of human innovation, emphasizing the balancing act required to enhance humanity without losing touch with its essence."},{"instruction":"What existing song could be fitting for her?","output":"Choosing a song for a character like Biomaxia should reflect her cutting-edge and high-tech nature, as well as her intellectual prowess and the existential challenges she faces between her humanity and technology. Here is a song that could be fitting for her: **\\"Radioactive\\" by Imagine Dragons** Lyrics like \\"I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones / Enough to make my systems blow / Welcome to the new age, to the new age\\" resonate with Biomaxia's origin story of a transformative accident leading to superhuman abilities. The theme of awakening to a new, powerful identity is perfect for a character that has become something more than human through technological enhancement. The song's fusion of rock elements with electronic influences encapsulates Biomaxia's blend of human and machine. The chorus's powerful declaration of being \\"Radioactive\\" can symbolize her empowered state and the almost elemental change she has undergone. It also captures the idea of facing a future that is both exhilarating and uncertain due to the integration of advanced technology, echoing Biomaxia’s role as both a guardian against the misuse of technology and a pioneer of its potential to improve the human condition."},{"instruction":"List five more.","output":"Certainly! Here are five more songs that could complement the theme and character of Biomaxia: 1. **\\"Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger\\" by Daft Punk** - The lyrics of this electro-house anthem repeat the mantra of improvement and strength, resonating with Biomaxia's constant self-enhancement through biomechanical technology. Its robotic vocoder vocals and futuristic sound capture her high-tech essence. 2. **\\"The Catalyst\\" by Linkin Park** - The song's themes of change and transformation, as well as its blend of electronic and rock elements, reflect Biomaxia's dual nature as both human and machine. The lyrics \\"God bless us everyone / We're a broken people living under loaded gun\\" could signify the responsibility she feels to protect humanity from the threats of misused technology. 3. **\\"Survivor\\" by Destiny's Child** - This track emphasizes strength and perseverance, which are crucial to Biomaxia's character as she navigates the challenges of her dual existence. Its empowering message is fitting for a superhero who survives against all odds and continues to fight for good. 4. **\\"Control\\" by Halsey** - Biomaxia's struggle with her identity and the balance between her human side and the machine is mirrored in this song's exploration of personal autonomy and inner conflict. \\"Who is in control?\\" echoes as a significant question for someone with Biomaxia's capabilities. 5. **\\"Digital Witness\\" by St. Vincent** - This song has a critical approach to the digital age and modern society's relationship with technology. For Biomaxia, it could serve as a reminder of the potential disconnect between technology and genuine human experience, something she works to reconcile within herself. Each song brings a unique angle to Biomaxia's narrative, from her transformation and empowerment to her internal and external struggles, as well as the broader implications of her existence for society and the world at large."},{"instruction":"죠죠의 기묘한 모험의 DIo와 언더테일의 chara의 대결으로 소설을 써줘","output":"먼지처럼 흩날리는 시간의 끝자락, 현실과 환상이 공존하는 차원의 교차점에서 두 존재가 맞닥뜨렸다. 한 사람은 죠죠의 기묘한 모험에서 온 악의 화신, 흡혈귀인 DIO. 다른 한 사람은 언더테일의 숲 속 어둠에서 길을 잃은 듯한 어린이, Chara. DIO는 위압적인 자태로 바라보며 웃었다. \\"내 이름은 DIO. 너와 같은 어린애는 햇볕 아래서 놀아야지, 이곳에선 오직 파멸만이 있을 뿐이다.\\" Chara는 조용히 칼을 들었다. 화려하지 않지만, 결의에 찬 눈빛. \\"나는 Chara. 이 세계에서도 어떤 존재든지 멈출 수 있다.\\" 이 불가사의한 만남은 서로 다른 운명의 충돌, 시공을 초월한 대결이었다. DIO는 그의 스탠드, [더 월드]를 소환하며 시간을 멈췄다. 공간이 얼어붙듯 일순간 정지하는 그의 힘은 무서울 정도였다. 그러나 Chara는 특유의 결단력으로 움직임을 멈추지 않았다. 그들은 결코 쉽게 굴복하지 않는 투지로 가득 찬 강자였다. DIO의 웃음이 차가운 공기를 가르며 울려퍼졌다. \\"이 어린애야, 너의 저항은 쓸데없는 짓이다. 넌 시간마저 내 의지에 굽히는 것을 볼 테니까.\\" 하지만 Chara는 단호했다. \\"마음의 결정이 시간보다 강하다면, 어떤 힘이라도 거스를 수 있어.\\" 대결이 시작되었다. DIO의 [더 월드]가 주먹을 휘둘렀지만, Chara도 뒤지지 않고 칼을 휘둘러 막아냈다. 두 전투자 사이에 불꽃이 튀었고, 충돌하는 기운이 시공간을 찢는 듯한 소음이었다. DIO는 Chara를 압도하려 했지만, Chara의 결의는 놀랍도록 강했다. 결국 Chara는 DIO의 시간 정지 사이에 공격의 틈을 찾아내고, 그의 칼날이 DIO를 향해 움직였다. 결정적인 순간, Chara의 눈에서는 인정사정 볼 것 없는 차가운 빛이 번뜩였다. 그 순간, DIO는 놀란 듯이 눈을 크게 떴고, Chara의 칼은 피할 수 없이 깊숙이 파고들었다. \\"이게... 끝이다,\\" Chara가 속삭였다. 그리고 순식간에 두 세계는 다시 원래대로 돌아갔다. DIO는 그의 차원으로 되돌아갔고, Chara는 언더테일의 세계로 돌아왔다. 그들의 대결은 차원을 넘나드는 한숨의 꿈처럼 희미해져갔지만, 그 만남은 영원히 우주의 기억 속에 남았다. 차원을 초월한 의지의 대전이란 결국 그들 각자의 세계에서의 모험과 무관하지 않은 것이었다."},{"instruction":"<!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <title>猜数字游戏</title> <style> .guess-input-container { display: flex; align-items: baseline; } .guess-input { margin-right: 10px; } .guess-button { margin-top: 10px; } </style> </head> <body> <h1>猜数字游戏</h1> <div> <button onclick=\\"generateRandomNumber()\\">点击生成随机数</button> <button onclick=\\"toggleRandomNumber()\\">查看</button> </div> <span id=\\"randomNumber\\" style=\\"display: none; white-space: nowrap\\"></span> <div class=\\"guess-input-container\\"> <label for=\\"guessInput\\">输入你要猜的数：</label> <input type=\\"number\\" id=\\"guessInput\\" class=\\"guess-input\\" /> <button onclick=\\"checkGuess()\\" class=\\"guess-button\\">猜一猜</button> </div> <p id=\\"output\\"> <ul id=\\"guesses\\"></ul> </p> <script> var answer; var guessesLeft = 20; function generateRandomNumber() { answer = Math.floor(Math.random() * 101); document.getElementById(\\"randomNumber\\").innerText = answer; } function toggleRandomNumber() { var randomNumber = document.getElementById(\\"randomNumber\\"); if (randomNumber.style.display === \\"none\\") { randomNumber.style.display = \\"inline\\"; } else { randomNumber.style.display = \\"none\\"; } } function checkGuess() { var guessInput = document.getElementById(\\"guessInput\\"); var output = document.getElementById(\\"output\\"); var guess = parseInt(guessInput.value); if (isNaN(guess)) { alert(\\"请输入有效的整数\\"); return; } if (guess < 0 || guess > 100) { alert(\\"请输入 0 到 100 之间的数\\"); return; } guessesLeft--; if (guess === answer) { guessInput.disabled = true; output.innerHTML += \\"<br>恭喜，你猜中了，答案是 \\" + answer + \\"，预测 \\" + (20 - guessesLeft) + \\" 次\\"; } else if (guess < answer) { output.innerHTML += \\"<br>遗憾，\\" + guess + \\" 太小了\\"; } else if (guess > answer) { output.innerHTML += \\"<br>遗憾，\\" + guess + \\" 太大了\\"; } if (guessesLeft === 0) { guessInput.disabled = true; output.innerHTML += \\"<br>很遗憾，你没有猜中。答案是 \\" + answer; generateRandomNumber(); output.innerHTML = \\"\\"; // Clear previous answers guessesLeft = 20; } } generateRandomNumber(); <\/script> </body> </html> 在完成20次猜测后再次点击猜一猜后自动生成新随机数并且删除原先回答","output":"<!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <title>猜数字游戏</title> <style> .guess-input-container { display: flex; align-items: baseline; } .guess-input { margin-right: 10px; } .guess-button { margin-top: 10px; } </style> </head> <body> <h1>猜数字游戏</h1> <div> <button onclick=\\"generateRandomNumber()\\">点击生成随机数</button> <button onclick=\\"toggleRandomNumber()\\">查看</button> </div> <span id=\\"randomNumber\\" style=\\"display: none; white-space: nowrap\\"></span> <div class=\\"guess-input-container\\"> <label for=\\"guessInput\\">输入你要猜的数：</label> <input type=\\"number\\" id=\\"guessInput\\" class=\\"guess-input\\" /> <button onclick=\\"checkGuess()\\" class=\\"guess-button\\">猜一猜</button> </div> <p id=\\"output\\"> <ul id=\\"guesses\\"></ul> </p> <script> var answer; var guessesLeft = 20; function generateRandomNumber() { answer = Math.floor(Math.random() * 101); document.getElementById(\\"randomNumber\\").innerText = answer; } function toggleRandomNumber() { var randomNumber = document.getElementById(\\"randomNumber\\"); if (randomNumber.style.display === \\"none\\") { randomNumber.style.display = \\"inline\\"; } else { randomNumber.style.display = \\"none\\"; } } function checkGuess() { var guessInput = document.getElementById(\\"guessInput\\"); var output = document.getElementById(\\"output\\"); var guessesList = document.getElementById(\\"guesses\\"); var guess = parseInt(guessInput.value); if (isNaN(guess)) { alert(\\"请输入有效的整数\\"); return; } if (guess < 0 || guess > 100) { alert(\\"请输入 0 到 100 之间的数\\"); return; } guessesLeft--; if (guess === answer) { guessInput.disabled = true; output.innerHTML += \\"<br>恭喜，你猜中了，答案是 \\" + answer + \\"，预测 \\" + (20 - guessesLeft) + \\" 次\\"; } else if (guess < answer) { output.innerHTML += \\"<br>遗憾，\\" + guess + \\" 太小了\\"; } else if (guess > answer) { output.innerHTML += \\"<br>遗憾，\\" + guess + \\" 太大了\\"; } if (guessesLeft === 0) { guessInput.disabled = true; output.innerHTML += \\"<br>很遗憾，你没有猜中。答案是 \\" + answer; generateRandomNumber(); output.innerHTML = \\"\\"; // Clear previous answers guessesLeft = 20; guessesList.innerHTML = \\"\\"; // Clear previous guesses list } else { guessesList.innerHTML += \\"<li>\\" + guess + \\"</li>\\"; // Add guess to the list } } generateRandomNumber(); <\/script> </body> </html>"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Đại hội XIII là cơ hội để định hình chiến lược phát triển của công đoàn, và tôi muốn gửi đến tất cả các đồng chí công đoàn và người lao động một thông điệp đầy khích lệ và ý nghĩa. Trước tiên, chúng ta cần tăng cường vai trò của tổ chức Công đoàn Việt Nam trong việc bảo vệ quyền lợi và lợi ích hợp pháp của người lao động. Chúng ta phải xây dựng và thực hiện các chính sách, pháp luật hỗ trợ người lao động trong mọi khía cạnh của cuộc sống, bao gồm lương thưởng công bằng, điều kiện làm việc an toàn, và chế độ phúc lợi xã hội bảo đảm. Đồng thời, chúng ta cần đề cao vai trò của công đoàn cơ sở và tăng cường sự đại diện và tương tác với đoàn viên công đoàn. Công đoàn cơ sở phải trở thành nơi gắn kết và đoàn kết, nơi mọi người lao động có thể gặp nhau và thảo luận về các vấn đề liên quan đến công việc và quyền lợi của họ. Chúng ta cần xây dựng một môi trường công đoàn cởi mở, thân thiện và đáng tin cậy để đồng hành cùng người lao động. Hơn nữa, chúng ta cần khuyến khích và tạo điều kiện cho sự sáng tạo và đổi mới trong lao động. Công đoàn cần hỗ trợ và thúc đẩy sự nâng cao trình độ chuyên môn và nghiên cứu khoa học của người lao động. Chúng ta cần khuyến khích ứng dụng công nghệ và quá trình sản xuất thông minh để tăng năng suất, cải thiện chất lượng và đảm bảo bền vững trong việc làm. Cuối cùng, tôi đề xuất việc xây dựng một môi trường làm việc tôn trọng và đại diện cho tất cả các nhóm người lao động, bao gồm cả nam giới, nữ giới, thanh niên và người lao động có khuyết tật. Chúng ta phải đảm bảo rằng không có ai bị bỏ lại phía sau và tất cả mọi người đều có cơ hội công bằng để phát triển nghề nghiệp và đóng góp cho sự phát triển của đất nước. Trên hết, sứ mệnh của chúng ta là phát triển cộng đồng người lao động đoàn kết và thịnh vượng. Với tinh thần đoàn kết và sự đổi mới, chúng ta có thể đạt được mục tiêu này và xây dựng một xã hội công bằng và tiến bộ hơn. Hãy cùng nhau hướng tới tương lai, tôi tin rằng sứ mệnh và giá trị của tổ chức Công đoàn Việt Nam sẽ được thể hiện tốt trong nhiệm kỳ 2023-2028. Hãy cùng chúng tôi đóng góp và xây dựng một tương lai tươi sáng cho người lao động và đất nước!

And at what point?","output":"The character Tintin, created by Belgian cartoonist Hergé, is the adventurous young reporter and protagonist of the comic series \\"The Adventures of Tintin.\\" Throughout the series, Tintin is frequently subjected to dangerous situations, including violence, natural disasters, kidnappings, and various forms of conflict. Despite these experiences, Tintin is consistently portrayed as resilient, resourceful, and largely unaffected by the psychological impact that such traumatic events might have on a real person. In reality, if Tintin were a real person, it's possible that he would suffer some form of trauma or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as a result of his experiences. Trauma can result from exposure to distressing events, and it affects individuals differently, often depending on a range of factors including personal resilience, support systems, and past history. If we were to speculate on particular points where Tintin might have experienced trauma, consider the following instances: 1. \\"The Cigars of the Pharaoh\\" and \\"The Blue Lotus\\": Tintin experiences being drugged and nearly entombed alive, which could be traumatic. 2. \\"The Black Island\\": Tintin suffers a gunshot wound and is pursued by a dangerous criminal gang, which could be a source of trauma. 3. \\"The Secret of the Unicorn\\" and \\"Red Rackham's Treasure\\": Tintin is kidnapped and faces life-threatening situations, such as being tied up and left to drown. 4. \\"Tintin in Tibet\\": Tintin is involved in a plane crash and experiences the harsh conditions of the Himalayas while searching for his friend Chang, which might lead to emotional distress and trauma. 5. \\"Flight 714 to Sydney\\": Tintin, along with his friends, is kidnapped by a criminal mastermind and faces various life-threatening scenarios including the prospect of being left on an erupting volcanic island. It should be noted, however, that \\"The Adventures of Tintin\\" are works of fiction, and part of their charm lies in the unrealistically unflappable nature of their hero. Tintin, like many comic book heroes, is designed to be a character who overcomes extraordinary obstacles without succumbing to psychological stress. This kind of unwavering heroism and perpetual optimism is a hallmark of his character and part of the escapism that such stories offer. Hergé's works do not delve into the psychological impacts of Tintin's adventures, as they're intended to be light-hearted and adventure-focused, rather than psychological dramas. However, if such psychological elements were to be included in a more realistic interpretation or adaptation, it could offer a new depth to Tintin's character, exploring the consequences of a life of relentless adventure and danger."},{"instruction":"In character Have Tintin tell Haddock about his trauma.","output":"As I embody the spirit of Tintin addressing Captain Haddock, we'll re-imagine this scenario with sensitivity to the topic of trauma: --- Captain Haddock, my dear friend, I've always tried to face our adventures with courage and a clear head, but there have been moments that have shaken me more deeply than I've let on. You know, the thrill of the chase, the narrow escapes, and our triumphs against all odds are all part of our adventures, but sometimes, when the night grows quiet and Snowy has curled up for sleep, I find my mind racing, replaying the perils we've faced. I remember the time in the Egyptian tombs when I was nearly entombed alive, feeling the walls close in around me, the fear was almost suffocating. These memories, they occasionally come back to haunt me, casting a long shadow over even our brightest days. The gunshot on the Black Island, it was more than just a flesh wound. It was a stark reminder of the razor's edge we walk between adventure and the end of all adventures. Though these scars have faded over time, their memory lingers, sometimes more vivid than I'd care to admit. And then there was Tibet. Not just the physical strain of our search for Chang, but the emotional weight, the uncertainty, the desperate hope against hope. It was a true test of my resolve. To this day, whenever I hear the howling wind, it takes me back to those icy slopes, and I feel a chill that doesn't come from the weather. But what bothers me the most, Captain, are not the memories of danger or the close calls we've had, but the thought that my pursuit for the truth, our quests for justice, they could put those dear to us in harm's way. You, Snowy, the Professor, even dear Chang—they’ve all been put in jeopardy because of our adventures. I don't mean to cast a pall over our escapades, for they have been full of camaraderie and indomitable spirit, and for that, I am ever grateful. This life of adventure is a part of who I am, and I wouldn't trade our friendship or the good we've done for anything in the world. But I suppose, Captain, I just wanted you to know that even Tintin has his moments of doubt and struggle. Knowing you're by my side gives me the strength to keep going, and I hope, in our future escapades, we can always rely on each other, come what may. --- It's important to acknowledge that such dialogue would represent a significant departure from the original material, as Hergé's Tintin is not depicted with these levels of self-reflection regarding personal trauma.

Per Kilobase of transcript per Million mapped reads) 或 TPM (Transcripts Per Million) 等方法将不同样本的reads数目进行标准化，使得可以比较不同样本之间的miRNA表达量。 2. 比较每个miRNA的表达量。可以使用统计方法，例如t检验、方差分析(ANOVA)等，来比较同一miRNA在不同样本之间的表达差异。在进行统计方法之前，可以对数据进行对数转换，例如使用log2(x+1)转换，可以减小表达量之间的差异。 3. 根据统计分析的结果计算差异表达倍数。在比较两个样本组之间的差异表达时，将具有差异表达的miRNA的表达量对数比作为差异倍数。差异倍数通常通过计算两个组之间的均值差异来衡量。 例如，如果miRNA X在两个样本组中的表达量分别为A和B，差异表达倍数可以通过计算log2(B/A)得到。如果log2(B/A) > 0，表示miRNA X在第二个样本组中的表达量较高，差异倍数为2的A次方；如果log2(B/A) < 0，表示miRNA X在第一个样本组中的表达量较高，差异倍数为2的(-A)次方。 需要注意的是，差异表达倍数应该与统计显著性一起考虑。在选择差异表达miRNA时，应该根据具体的统计显著性水平进行筛选。"},{"instruction":"解释“莫拉维克悖论”存在的原因","output":"莫拉维克悖论存在的原因主要有两个方面： 首先，莫拉维克悖论涉及到了运动的概念。在经典物理学中，我们常常将运动看作是物体在时空中随时间而变化的位置。然而，量子力学则告诉我们，微观粒子的位置并不是唯一确定的，而是存在着不确定性。莫拉维克悖论正是基于这种不确定性而提出的，它指出在某些情况下，我们无法准确地确定一个微观粒子的位置和运动轨迹。 其次，莫拉维克悖论还牵涉到了观察者的角色。在经典物理学中，观察者被看作是客观存在的，他们的存在并不会对物体的状态产生影响。然而，量子力学认为观察者的存在会对微观粒子的状态产生测量效应，即所谓的“测量坍缩”。莫拉维克悖论通过在观察者的视角下考虑量子体系的运动，揭示了观察者在测量微观粒子位置时所面临的困境，即无法同时准确测量微观粒子的位置和动量。 综上所述，莫拉维克悖论存在的原因主要在于量子力学中的运动不确定性和测量效应的概念，以及观察者在测量微观粒子时面临的困境。这些概念的引入打破了经典物理学中运动和观察的简单认知，为我们带来了关于量子体系的深入思考和理解的挑战。"},{"instruction":"莫拉维克悖论是什么","output":"莫拉维克悖论是量子力学中一个悖论性的实验观察结果。它指出，当观察者对两个或多个粒子进行实验，并试图确定它们的位置时，粒子之间的相互作用将导致它们的运动是不可预测的，即无法同时准确测量它们的位置和动量。 莫拉维克悖论是由约翰·斯图尔特·贝尔和尼尔·加瑟尔·莫拉维克等人在20世纪20年代和30年代提出的。该悖论的实验方案是基于粒子的干涉性实验，比如双缝实验。在双缝实验中，当只有一个缝口开放时，粒子的位置可以被准确测量；然而，当两个缝口都打开时，粒子呈现出干涉图样，其位置将不再具有确定性，无法同时准确测量。 莫拉维克悖论说明了观察者和被观察对象之间的相互关系。在测量时，观察者的存在会影响粒子的状态，导致其无法同时具有确定的位置和动量。这与经典物理学中观察者被认为不影响被观察对象的状态的观点形成了明显的对比。莫拉维克悖论的存在挑战了我们对量子力学中测量和观察的理解，引发了对量子世界真实性和测量效应的深入思考和讨论。"},{"instruction":"解释人工智能中“莫拉维克悖论”存在的原因","output":"在人工智能中，\\"莫拉维克悖论\\"并非指的是量子力学中的悖论，而是指的是莫拉维克AI悖论。 莫拉维克AI悖论是由人工智能专家艾班莫拉维克在2017年提出的。该悖论指出，在目前的人工智能系统中，随着技术的发展，让计算机具备人类智能的任务和功能实现会越来越困难。 莫拉维克AI悖论的存在有以下原因： 1.规模问题：人类智能是在自然界长时间演化中形成的复杂系统，而现有的人工智能系统是基于规则和算法设计的，无法充分模拟和复制人类智能的复杂性和广度。 2.学习和训练数据问题：人类智能能够通过大量的感知、经验和学习来获取知识，但目前的人工智能系统往往需要大量的标记数据来进行学习和训练。获取和标记大规模数据集是一项耗时且昂贵的任务，并且有时可能会受到数据样本的偏见和限制。 3.理解与概念问题：人类在处理问题时具备对问题的全面的理解和高级概念的应用能力。但目前的人工智能系统在处理复杂问题时往往是基于具体的规则和算法，缺乏对问题的整体理解和高级概念的应用能力。 4. 深度学习和黑盒问题：目前主流的人工智能系统往往基于深度学习方法，这种方法对于问题的解释和解决过程常常形成“黑盒”，无法直观理解或解释其决策的过程和原因。这限制了人工智能系统在某些需要解释和可信度要求高的任务中的应用。 综上所述，莫拉维克AI悖论存在的原因主要是由于当前人工智能系统还无法完全复制和模拟人类智能的复杂性和广度，而且在数据获取、问题理解和解释等方面仍面临着挑战。"},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for

Tintin's character is the intrepid reporter and adventurer who is more focused on solving mysteries and getting to the bottom of every situation he finds himself in than exploring romantic relationships. This choice has allowed the stories to remain timeless and accessible to a broad range of readers by focusing on universal themes of adventure, bravery, and friendship. However, if we were to imagine a scenario where Tintin had a love interest, it would fundamentally change the dynamics of the series. How each story would be altered would depend greatly on the personality and skills of this new character and her relationship with Tintin. 1. **Meeting Place**: She could have met Tintin on one of his many adventures. For instance, she could have been a fellow reporter, a local aiding him on his quest, or perhaps even someone on the opposite side of a conflict who switches sides after meeting Tintin. 2. **Altering the Stories**: Her presence would likely add a completely new dimension to the stories. Subplots involving romance or protection of a loved one could come into play. Additionally, her skills could complement Tintin's investigative abilities, perhaps offering insights or coming up with solutions that Tintin might not have considered. 3. **Character Dynamics**: The inclusion of a love interest would also change the dynamics between the existing characters. For example, Captain Haddock's role as Tintin's closest confidant might be adjusted to allow for moments between Tintin and his love interest. The character of Snowy, Tintin's loyal companion, might become more protective or even jealous, depending on how the dynamic is written. 4. **Action Sequences**: Romantic elements may lead to increased personal stakes during action sequences. Tintin might have to balance his natural tendency to jump into danger with the consideration of the well-being and feelings of his partner. 5. **Themes and Motivations**: The underlying motivations behind Tintin's adventures might shift from seeking the truth and justice to also protecting or involving the interests of his love interest. As interesting as this scenario may be to consider, it's important to remember that adding a love interest would likely have led to a fundamentally different series, potentially moving away from the appeal that has made Tintin a global icon. One of the individual strengths of the Tintin series is its ability to retain a timeless and ageless quality, which allows anyone, regardless of age and gender, to see themselves in the daring reporter's adventures. The addition of a romantic subplot could have tied the series to more conventional structures and potentially dated it, affecting its universal appeal. The original choice to keep Tintin's personal life out of the equation has contributed to the longevity and classic status of the series."},{"instruction":"Full detail on all.","output":"When discussing in full detail a hypothetical situation where Tintin has a love interest, it's important to recognize that each Tintin adventure is quite distinct, featuring various locales, social contexts, and types of conflict. This means that the love interest's presence and actions would have idiosyncratic effects on each individual story. Here's a speculative and imaginative exploration of how this new character might fit within the Tintin universe and how her presence might alter the narratives: # Meeting Place The love interest could be introduced in multiple ways: - As a fellow reporter or photographer encountering Tintin during a shared assignment. - A local who becomes entangled with Tintin in the series of events, like in \\"The Broken Ear\\" or \\"Tintin in Tibet.\\" - An acquaintance from Marlinspike Hall, perhaps a relative or friend of Captain Haddock. - A member of the opposition, such as a reformed antagonist. # Altering the Stories Let's consider a few Tintin stories and how they could be altered: - **\\"The Blue Lotus\\"**: Tintin's love interest, possibly a foreign correspondent or an ally against the opium trade, could add an intimate dimension to Tintin's personal stake in the conflict, perhaps even being kidnapped by the smugglers at some point, thus raising the stakes for Tintin. - **\\"The Secret of the Unicorn\\" / \\"Red Rackham's Treasure\\"**: The love interest could be involved in the search for the treasure, providing moments where Tintin has to balance his quest with ensuring her safety, possibly sparking jealousy in Captain Haddock. - **\\"Tintin in Tibet\\"**: This is a deeply personal story about friendship. The presence of a love interest in this story might seem a bit intrusive, but if included smoothly, she could symbolize the emotional support system for Tintin as he searches for Chang. - **\\"The Calculus Affair\\"**: The love interest could actively help in the rescue of Professor Calculus, perhaps using her own skills or knowledge to contribute to the mystery-solving and espionage aspects of the story. # Character Dynamics With the addition of a love interest, traditional dynamics would naturally evolve: - Tintin and Captain Haddock's relationship might include a third confidant or even occasional tensions if the Captain feels sidelined. - The love interest could offer a different kind of companionship to Tintin compared to Snowy, potentially encouraging him to take fewer risks. - Professor Calculus might be intrigued by the scientific aspects of love and companionship, perhaps even creating devices to protect or assist Tintin's love interest. # Action Sequences Some potential ways action sequences would be different include: - Tintin might have dual objectives during conflicts, such as saving the day while also ensuring the safety of his partner. - The love interest could sometimes be the one in peril, possibly captured or in danger, making Tintin's missions more urgent. # Themes and Motivations Romantic themes would insert new motivations for Tintin: - Personal protection and the well-being of his love interest might become a driving force in his actions. - Romantic subplots might require careful balancing to not overshadow the series' traditional themes of adventure and moral integrity. # Conclusion Ultimately, the addition of a consistent love interest in Tintin's world would create a series of ripples that would fundamentally change the storytelling dynamics, character motivations, and perhaps even the thematic essence of the series. Hergé's choice to keep Tintin free from romantic entanglements allowed the stories to retain a unique universal focus on adventure and human values, unencumbered by the complexities that romantic subplots can introduce. Each potential alteration posited here is a speculative work of fandom, as the true Tintin series remains a classic in its original form."},{"instruction":"What if she and Tintin kept nesrly crossing paths, in a Just missed them sort of way, and at what points in certain stories?","output":"The concept of Tintin and a potential love interest almost crossing paths but never quite meeting is an intriguing idea. It’s reminiscent of classic romantic stories where fate keeps two would-be lovers just out of reach. Such a narrative device could enhance the sense of destiny and inject an element of romantic tension without altering the core action-adventure nature of the stories. Here are speculative ways in which Tintin and his mysterious love interest could have narrowly missed each other in several of the iconic Tintin stories: # \\"Cigars of the Pharaoh\\" While investigating the mystery of the cigars, Tintin could narrowly miss an encounter with his potential love interest in Egypt, perhaps as she investigates a related story about antiquities smuggling, or as she independently explores the same tomb Tintin gets trapped in, missing him by mere moments. # \\"The Blue Lotus\\" She could be a foreign journalist or Red Cross worker in Shanghai at the same time as Tintin’s investigation. They might dine in the same restaurants, walk the same streets, but a series of interruptions and narrowly missed meetings keeps them apart. # \\"The Secret of the Unicorn\\" / \\"Red Rackham's Treasure\\" She could be present at the market where Tintin buys the model of the Unicorn, looking at a nearby stall. Later, she might be at the docks while Tintin and Captain Haddock set sail, perhaps conducting her own investigation into maritime history. # \\"The Seven Crystal Balls\\" / \\"Prisoners of the Sun\\" During the investigation of the archaeologists' curse, Tintin's love interest could be a fellow visitor at the same museum or theatre show. When Tintin visits the hospital where the afflicted explorers are kept, she might just be leaving from a humanitarian visit. # \\"Tintin in Tibet\\" Tintin's love interest could be part of another expedition on the Himalayas. They could stay in the same lodges or use the same Sherpas without realizing it. She might have even heard echoes of Tintin’s calls for Chang or observed the avalanche from a distance. # \\"Flight 714 to Sydney\\" At Jakarta airport, Tintin's mystery woman might be seen in the background, boarding another flight or reporting on another story, as Tintin and his party board their ill-fated flight. # \\"Tintin and the Picaros\\" She could be an activist or journalist covering political unrest in the fictional San Theodoros. As Tintin navigates the volatile political landscape, she’s always one step ahead or behind, reporting on the events that he is actively influencing. In each story, small hints could suggest her presence: a glimpse of a figure in a crowd, an unnamed quote in a newspaper article, or an unidentified voice on a telephone line. Cleverly placed Easter eggs could build anticipation for the audience, hinting at a connection destined to happen but always frustratingly deferred. This kind of storytelling could add a layer of depth and provide fans with an engaging \\"behind-the-scenes\\" mystery to follow along with the main narrative. It would also allow Hergé to maintain Tintin’s independent and adventurous spirit intact while adding a subtle romantic element for readers to ponder over. In creating such a scenario, one must ensure it does not detract from the main plot or the essential characterizations in the Tintin series. It should be a delicate touch, a background element that adds flavor without overwhelming the classic taste of Tintin's adventures."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Her school had students that were part of the different races of the Alliance, where their homes were all in Stormwind City; and the Horde, where all their homes were in Orgrimmar - and there were also students from the allied races of both major factions. One day, Sayori passed by her classmate Tinkbizzink - a young goblin girl who was a priest-in-training who was blind in her left eye; and goblins were one of the allied races.)","output":"Sayori: Hey, Tinkbizzink! How are you doing today? Tinkbizzink: Oh, hey Sayori. I'm doing alright, thanks. Just studying some holy spells for my priest training. What about you? Sayori: Oh, you know me, always up to some rogue shenanigans. Trying to learn new tricks to outsmart opponents during our training sessions. But enough about me, how's everything going with your studies? Tinkbizzink: It's been a bit challenging, especially since I'm blind in my left eye. But I've been working hard, relying on my other senses to compensate. I'm determined to become the best priest I can be! Sayori: That's incredible, Tinkbizzink! Your determination is truly inspiring. If there's anything I can do to help you out, just let me know. Tinkbizzink: Thanks, Sayori. I appreciate your offer. Maybe someday you can teach me some rogue techniques, so I can defend myself better too. Sayori: Absolutely! We make a great team, learning from each other. It's nice having a friend like you who understands the struggles of training in different classes. Tinkbizzink: Agreed, Sayori. It's refreshing to have someone to share experiences with. Everyone here may be from different races and factions, but we can all learn from one another. Sayori: Definitely. Unity and understanding are what we need to overcome the challenges we face in our training and in the world beyond these walls. Tinkbizzink: Absolutely, Sayori. With our skills and knowledge combined, we can make a real difference. We may come from different backgrounds, but we share a common bond that transcends our differences. Sayori: That's the spirit, Tinkbizzink! Together, we can break down barriers and create a more harmonious future for all races and factions. Tinkbizzink: I couldn't agree more, Sayori. Let's keep working hard and supporting each other. The possibilities are endless when we stand united. Sayori: I couldn't have said it better myself.

Like where and what were they doing?","output":"Incorporating a secret admirer into the Tintin universe would require some creative storytelling while respecting the original material written by Hergé. Since Tintin is a character who has traveled around the world and interacted with a diverse cast of characters, a secret admirer could be introduced as someone who either encountered Tintin during one of his adventures or learned about him through the many articles he's been featured in as a reporter. Here are a few scenarios in which a secret admirer could fit into the Tintin canon: 1. A fellow journalist: The admirer could be a journalist who has read Tintin's articles or perhaps met him at a press conference. This character could subtly appear in the background of a couple of stories, showing an interest in Tintin's work and his brave exploits. 2. A character from a previous adventure: Revisiting one of the classic stories, a minor character previously overlooked could be developed further to have a hidden affection for Tintin. This character may have been inspired by Tintin's bravery and kindness, and in later stories, they could find reasons to cross paths with him again, while keeping their feelings a secret. 3. A member of the audience: During one of Tintin's public appearances or in a crowd scene, there could be a recurring character that seems to always be present in the background. Over time, this admirer may start sending Tintin anonymous messages or gifts indicative of their feelings. 4. An aristocrat or royal: Considering Tintin's interactions with various figures of high society, such as the Maharajah of Gaipajama, an admirer could be someone of noble birth who respects Tintin's moral integrity and courage. This person might try to assist Tintin discreetly on his quests or invite him to events in hopes of getting closer. 5. A colleague of Captain Haddock or Professor Calculus: Since Tintin spends a considerable amount of time with his companions, a secret admirer could be introduced as a new associate or relative of either Captain Haddock or Professor Calculus. This person could justify their presence in Marlinspike Hall or join expeditions, all the while harboring a quiet admiration for Tintin. To ensure that such a character fits seamlessly into the Tintin canon, this secret admirer would have to be subtly woven into the existing narrative, not overshadowing the main plot or altering Tintin's character. Tintin himself is depicted as being quite oblivious to romantic interests, focusing instead on solving mysteries, so the secret admirer subplot would need to be handled with a light touch that is in keeping with the spirit of Hergé's work."},{"instruction":"How could they fit into certain stories?","output":"Integrating a secret admirer into specific Tintin stories while maintaining the integrity of the original works requires careful planning and a light touch. I'll provide some hypothetical examples of how a secret admirer could be woven into key Tintin adventures: 1. \\"The Blue Lotus\\" The admirer could be an artist or student whom Tintin meets while in China. They might be initially drawn to Tintin for his sense of justice and later subtly appear in a few panels, watching from a distance as Tintin foils the opium smuggling ring. Later, Tintin could receive small, anonymous gifts, like protective charms, hinting at someone looking out for him. 2. \\"The Seven Crystal Balls\\" A relative of one of the expedition members from the Sanders-Hardiman Ethnographic Expedition could be a secret admirer. This person attends Tintin’s lecture on the expedition and takes a quiet interest in Tintin’s bravery as he works to solve the mystery. They could be seen sitting in one of the audience seats, reacting emotionally to Tintin's reports. 3. \\"The Secret of the Unicorn\\" and \\"Red Rackham's Treasure\\" The admirer could be someone who becomes fascinated by Tintin after seeing him at the flea market or reading about him in the newspaper. They stealthily follow the treasure hunt, perhaps leaving behind a clue or an anonymous note offering encouragement or advice at a critical moment. 4. \\"Tintin in Tibet\\" One of the Sherpas or a local Tibetan could harbor affection for Tintin, respecting his relentless search for Chang. They could be a consistent presence in the background, offering discreet assistance or secretly following Tintin's expedition from a distance, worried about his safety. 5. \\"Flight 714 to Sydney\\" The admirer could be a member of the ground staff or flight crew who has learned much about Tintin and is starstruck when he boards the flight. Once the adventure takes its twist, they could be seen in the background looking worried or trying to find ways to help without being overt. 6. \\"The Castafiore Emerald\\" A visitor or a hired helper at Marlinspike Hall could form a silent bond with Tintin, watching him interact with the operatic diva and deal with the chaos around the missing emerald. This character might shy away from the main action but look on with understated admiration. 7. \\"Tintin and Alph-Art\\" In Hergé's final, unfinished Tintin album, a gallery visitor or another artist could be introduced as someone who admires Tintin's reputation for integrity and curiosity. They might provide an anonymous tip that helps Tintin in his investigation or leave a sketch of Tintin that he comes across, suggesting someone observant of his character. In each of these scenarios, the secret admirer should never detract from Tintin’s goal-driven nature or the key elements of the plot. It would be essential to keep their presence subtle and consistent with the tone of each story. The charm lies in the understatement and the mystery, aligning with Hergé's style of having several background characters and details that enrich the world without necessarily driving the narrative forward."},{"instruction":"I meant what are they doing and where were they during the events of certain stories?","output":"To speculate on the background activities and whereabouts of a secret admirer during certain Tintin stories, they would need to blend into the established narrative framework discreetly. Let's further explore their potential roles in specific adventures: 1. \\"The Blue Lotus\\" During the events in China, a secret admirer could be a local student or artist who observes Tintin's dealings with the opium den and his alliance with the Sons of the Dragon. As Tintin navigates the political tensions, this admirer could be someone working in the background, perhaps leaving anonymous notes of support or sketches of Tintin at locations he frequents, such as the teahouse where Tintin meets Chang. 2. \\"The Seven Crystal Balls\\" The admirer could be a museum employee or a friend of Professor Tarragon, who is present at the lecturers that feature the returned expedition. They would be off to the side, behind the scenes, during the Professor's lectures, or even at the theater where the first victim falls into a coma. This character would likely follow Tintin and Captain Haddock’s investigation from the shadows, worried but unable to intervene due to the mysterious nature of the curse. 3. \\"The Secret of the Unicorn\\" and \\"Red Rackham's Treasure\\" The admirer could function here as a local historian or maritime enthusiast who is researching the same period as the shipwreck of the Unicorn. During the events, they could be at the library or archives, unnoticed in the background, observing Tintin as he researches the model ship and later provides subtle assistance, such as directing him to useful resources without revealing their identity. 4. \\"Tintin in Tibet\\" In this adventure, the admirer could be one of the individuals at the Kathmandu guest house or perhaps someone associated with the mountain rescue team. This person would admire Tintin's unwavering determination to find his friend Chang amidst impossible conditions. They may be seen behind the scenes, offering silent moral support or even which is not far-fetched given Tintin's reputation — they could anonymously fund or assist with logistics for the search and rescue efforts. 5. \\"Flight 714 to Sydney\\" The admirer could belong to the staff of the private island or be a bystander at the airport who notices Tintin but keeps their distance out of respect for his privacy. During the hijacking and subsequent adventure on the island, the admirer would not play an active role but might be among the ground crew or passengers who express concern for Tintin's safety after his disappearance. 6. \\"The Castafiore Emerald\\" At Marlinspike Hall, the secret admirer might fill the role of a gardener, a temporary staff member, or even one of the reporters who come to interview Bianca Castafiore. They could contribute to the tranquility of Marlinspike by offering subtle help that goes unnoticed, like leaving a ladder in a convenient location or tending to the roses admired by Castafiore, which might indirectly assist in revealing the location of the missing emerald. 7. \\"Tintin and Alph-Art\\" This admirer could be present in the art gallery as Tintin begins his investigation. Perhaps they work there or frequent the gallery as an art enthusiast. They could be seen in the story's margins, offering unspoken resolve for Tintin as he delves deeper into the mystery surrounding Ramó Nash and the Alph-Art. These speculative scenarios ensure the secret admirer's actions happen off the main stage, keeping them in the background as they follow Tintin through his adventures affectionately and silently. These roles would maintain the narrative flow of the original stories without interfering with the main plot points."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

This fortress was not only a bastion of knowledge and research but a place where the boundaries between the world known to men and the unseen realms were tested by the Kingdom's most advanced scholars and magicians, known as scientists. **Half-Life**: In the citadel's deepest dungeons, a young, promising alchemist named Gordon Freeman was preparing a grand experiment alongside his fellow mages. They sought to tap into the energies of a crystal from a distant land, an artifact believed to be a nexus of untold power that could reshape the very fabric of reality. However, as the grand ritual commenced, something went awry. The crystal's energies could not be contained, unleashing a cataclysmic event known as the Resonance Cascade. Portals to other dimensions flew open, allowing creatures and entities from beyond to invade the citadel and lay waste to the surrounding kingdom. Freeman, equipped with armor and an alchemical tool that functioned as a versatile weapon—the fabled \\"Crowbar of Destiny\\"—journeyed through the twisted, chaotic halls of Black Mesa. He battled fiendish abominations and allied with the citadel's surviving defenders to make his way to the ethereal borderlands called Xen, where he confronted the source of the invasion, the Nihilanth. A mighty clash of physical might and arcane energies ensued, and Freeman triumphed, banishing the otherworldly invader. Yet, at the moment of his victory, a mysterious and powerful sorcerer known as the G-Man, who operated beyond the ken of mortals, ensnared Freeman in time, speaking of future tasks for which the alchemist's skills were required. **Half-Life 2**: After what seemed like an eternity or perhaps a mere moment, the G-Man released Freeman into a world transformed. The citadel of Black Mesa was no more, and in its place stood a grand City 17, ruled with an iron fist by an otherworldly occupier known as the Combine, comprised of both unworldly creatures and treacherous humans who had sworn fealty to their new overlords. Freeman found himself recruited into the resistance, a growing movement of knights, thieves, scholars, and commonfolk, who sought to end the tyranny of the Combine and restore freedom to their land. Freeman's legend had grown over the years, and his arrival sparked hope among the downtrodden. Wielding his mighty Crowbar once again, along with new artifacts of power such as the crossbow and the enigmatic gravity-manipulating device known as the Gravity Gauntlet, Freeman fought alongside the resistance. He undertook perilous quests through City 17, the haunted ruins of Ravenholm, and the strongholds of the Combine oppressors. His journey led him to ally with powerful figures, such as the wise sorceress Alyx Vance and her inventor father Eli Vance, who unlocked the potential of arcane technology to aid the resistance. Together, they assaulted the towering bastion of the Combine, the Citadel, and struck a decisive blow by destabilizing its dark energy core, setting the stage for an even greater conflict to free their world. **Half-Life 2: Episode One and Episode Two**: In the aftermath of the Citadel's fall, Freeman and Alyx fled the collapsing City 17, embarking on a quest to join the scattered resistance and continue their fight. The land was fraught with peril, for the invaders sought to open a gateway for massive reinforcements to crush the rebellious souls once and for all. After traversing the treacherous terrain and battling both the Combine's minions and denizens of the alien-infested landscape, Freeman and his comrades reached a bastion of hope, the resistance base known as White Forest. Here, they intended to utilize an arcane message hidden within a surviving fragment of the Black Mesa artifact, which would summon allies from other realms and turn the tide of war. However, in a devastating turn of events, the resistance faced great tragedy as Eli Vance was slain by a dark assassin sent by the Combine, leaving Freeman, Alyx, and their companions to grieve even as they remained resolved to continue their struggle. As our retelling comes to a close, the tale remains unfinished, with the heroes forging on, their fates uncertain and their foe relentless. Yet, the songs of their bravery continue to inspire, etching the Half-Life saga into the annals of legend, a timeless tale of tyranny, rebellion, and the indomitable will of the human spirit."},{"instruction":"try reformatting this so that the bullet points dont glitch when i paste it into itch.io. bullet points like the one preceding \\"CPU builds that would\\" i didn’t get around to explaining ingame the activation conditions for most of the skills yet V0.5.1 Balance: • Drawing a card from the draw pile no longer lowers LIMIT by 1 • The game is now an auto-battler o Active-use skills are now used automatically from the left to the right of your inventory once they meet the required SP cost and any additional conditions of the skill  CPU builds that would be affected by this have been reordered o Picking up cards, drawing cards from the draw pile, and ending your turn are what uses active skills, depending on the type  Skills that add activate on picking up a card or drawing are described as activating “on taking an action”  Used on picking up a card or drawing a card from the draw pile: Attacks, ‘Guard’, ‘Shovel’, ‘Gemology’ • ‘Shovel’ and ‘Gemology’ roll for their probability to activate based on how many peak cards are accessible  Used on ending turn: ‘Parry’, ‘Meditate’, ‘Block’, ‘Repel’, ‘Entrap’, ‘Grab’ o Card icon-adding skills add one icon per skill  This means ‘Block’, ‘Entrap’, ‘Health Potion’, etc. won’t be used if an icon it has added is already on the board  The exceptions are ‘Sword’, ‘Glomp’, and ‘Necronomicon’ o Skills that only add icons will not activate if there are no icon-addable spaces o Certain skills have a cooldown before they can be used again  ‘Guard’, ‘Entrap’, ‘Health Potion’, ‘Gemology’ each have a 3-turn cooldown  ‘Repel’ has a 3-turn cooldown that increases by one with each use  ‘Sacrifice’ has a 1-turn cooldown • Attack-type skills now cost 4 SP at the minimum • ‘Grow’ now has normal base damage when upgraded, but gets 3 max bonus damage at A rank • ‘Guard’, ‘Entrap’, and ‘Health Potion’ no longer cost SP • ‘Meditate’: o Now adds [9/7/5] LIMIT at rank [C/B/A] o Now also deactivates when you draw a card from the deck, or when LIMIT is > 0 • ‘Bite’ now deals 2 DMG, and has an SP cost that increases by [3/2/1] after use at ranks [C/B/A] • ‘Grab’: o Costs [2/1/0] SP at rank [C/B/A], always applies ‘Stun’ to the user o Now also deactivates when you draw a card from the deck, or when your opponent is already inflicted with ‘Lock’ status • ‘Sacrifice’ is inactive unless OVERLIMIT • ‘Health Potion’ adds 1x ‘Slow’ status to self at all ranks, cools down by [3/2/1] at rank [C/B/A] • ‘Block’ adds a [3/4/5]-turn ‘Shield’ icon at rank [C/B/A] and applies at the end of the turn • ‘Guard’ adds a [3/4/5]-turn ‘Shield’ icon at rank [C/B/A], has no SP cost, applies on taking an action, and has a 3-turn cooldown • ‘Repel’ adds a 3-turn ‘Shield’ icon and has a 3-turn cooldown that increases every time it’s used and doesn’t reset • ‘Entrap’ has a 1/3 chance to add [one/one or two] more ‘Caltrop’ icons at rank [B/A] • ‘Health Potion’ has a [3/2/1] turn cooldown at rank [C/B/A] • ‘Gemology’ has no SP cost, lowers its cooldown by one on picking up a peak card, and has a applied cooldown of [3/2/1] at rank [C/B/A] • ‘Shovel’ now no longer deals more DMG or increases in SP cost, instead it deals [0/2/4] LIMIT to the enemy at rank [C/B/A] • ‘Charge’ has been removed Bug: • Fixed using ‘Dagger’ preventing character speech caused by picking up several cards • Fixed disconnecting and reconnecting audio devices not working • Fixed a crash on starting the application with no audio devices o Audio works if you start the application without audio and then add an audio device • Fixed music not playing on starting the application with no audio device/disconnecting an audio device and re-adding one • Attempted a fix at a hard to replicate graphical artifact on activating full screen mode • Card icons now only time down when passing the turn to the next player, not on your first hand/turn’s end Other: • The ‘End Hand’ button now says ‘Next Hand’ • Rewrote skill descriptions • The tutorial for ending your turn when OVERLIMIT now only appears when your opponent isn’t stunned, since it doesn’t apply otherwise • SFX and music settings save/load on closing/opening the game • Title screen’s win streak text gets more excited!!!

Мне нужно анализировать тексты на предмет их возможного происхождения от искусственного интеллекта. Мог бы ты указать, какие характеристики и признаки я должен искать, чтобы определить, что текст был сгенерирован моделью, подобной тебе? Какие паттерны, стилистика, типичные ошибки или отсутствие определенных элементов могут выдать генерацию текста ИИ? Пожалуйста, предоставь подробный список критериев для анализа. ChatGPT","output":"Привет! Вот некоторые характеристики и признаки, на которые можно обратить внимание при анализе текста для определения его происхождения от искусственного интеллекта, такого как модель, на которой основан ChatGPT: 1. Консистентность: Искусственный интеллект обычно проявляет высокую степень консистентности в своих ответах. Это означает, что он будет последовательным и не будет противоречить самому себе внутри одного текста или в разных контекстах. Если ты замечаешь противоречия или непоследовательность логики в тексте, это может указывать на его нечеловеческое происхождение. 2. Область знаний: ИИ-модели, подобные ChatGPT, могут воспроизводить информацию, с которой они были обучены, но у них может быть ограниченная способность генерировать новые или актуальные знания. Если текст содержит сведения, которые устарели, или неточные сведения, это может свидетельствовать о генерации ИИ. 3. Стилистика: Модель ИИ может проявлять определенные стилистические особенности в своем тексте. Некоторые модели могут охотно использовать сложные и специализированные слова или технические термины, в то время как другие могут склоняться к более простому и доступному стилю. Сравнивая стилистику с известными образцами произведений ИИ, можно выделить некоторые отличительные черты. 4. Ответ на несуществующие вопросы: ИИ-модели могут демонстрировать трудности в понимании абстрактных, неопределенных или нелогичных запросов. Если текст содержит явные проблемы в ответах на такие вопросы или запросы, это может свидетельствовать о происхождении от ИИ. 5. Аномальная грамматика или структура предложений: ИИ-модели могут иногда порождать предложения с необычной или нелогичной грамматикой, или структурой, которая не типична для человеческой речи. Обращение внимания на подобные аномалии может помочь определить их происхождение. Но важно отметить, что эти признаки не всегда являются определяющими и должны рассматриваться в контексте. В конце концов, некоторые ИИ-модели могут стараться имитировать человеческую речь, поэтому одиночный признак, возможно, недостаточен для окончательного суждения о происхождении текста."},{"instruction":"Создай промпт с включением всех этих пунктов, для анализа текста по шкале от 1 до 100, где 100 текст написанный нейросетью.","output":"Конечно!

This reversed narrative will focus on significant plot points and will entail undoing the story's progress. **Half-Life 2: Episode Two (Reversed)** We find Gordon and Alyx Vance, having failed to prevent the destruction of City 17, being drawn back to the now-stable superportal as the Resistance’s efforts to close it are undone. Ahead of them, the Combine Advisors revive Eli Vance, and then less menacingly extract information from his mind, before leaving peacefully. Gordon and Alyx might then 'untravel' across the White Forest, disengaging in skirmishes with Combines and Antlions, 'unrepairing' Alyx who has suffered no injuries and is in perfect health. **Half-Life 2: Episode One (Reversed)** The Citadel in City 17 is reconstructed from ruins to its menacing whole. Alyx and Gordon avoid Combine forces, who progressively become less alert and preoccupied with the pair's presence as the city unevacuates. Citizens return to their homes while Dog 'undigs' them out of the rubble where they were never trapped. At the end, everyone inexorably drifts apart, away from the danger that has been restored to dormancy. **Half-Life 2 (Reversed)** The sequence begins with the Combine’s fortress, the Citadel, intact as Gordon Freeman deboards a train 'leaving' City 17. The once-oppressive metropolis becomes less ruinous; its citizens regain fear and subjugation. Gordon continues to detach from the resistance, taking away weapons, supplies, and information. Barney, Alyx, and Dr. Kleiner appear less familiar with him as he progresses. The resonance of freedom and uprising quells. **Half-Life (Reversed)** Proceeding back to the original Half-Life, the Black Mesa Incident is meticulously undone. Gordon Freeman, a theoretical physicist, turns from a hero amidst chaos to an ordinary researcher. Alien creatures are pulled back into their dimension as Gordon disrepairs the damage to the facility. The iconic crowbar is returned to its rightful place as a nondescript piece of equipment, rather than the symbol of resistance against an extraterrestrial invasion. We continue back through the facility, which becomes progressively less damaged and more orderly. The science team 'un-experiments' with the foreign sample, pulling the alien world apart from ours and erasing the catastrophic resonance cascade. Finally, Gordon stands in the anti-mass spectrometer chamber, pushing the cart away, piecing together the crystal and undoing the experiment that never took place. With that, the normal day at the research facility is restored, erasing all traces of conflict, revolution, and defiance that Gordon Freeman would come to embody. In a tale told backwards, the hero's journey is a stripping away of action and achievement until nothing remains but the quiet potential of a regular workday, and the oppressive forces of alien invaders are nothing more than a distant, unrealized threat."},{"instruction":"Now make it all coherent.","output":"Telling a coherent story of Half-Life in reverse proves challenging because the narrative would involve unmaking circumstances and relationships, which typically doesn’t make for a logical progression of events. However, I'll attempt to frame the Half-Life series as if the events are seen through a temporal mirror, unwinding rather than unfolding. **Half-Life 2: Episode Two (Reversed)** We open in a world of mourning and defeat. The Vortigaunts disengage from their healing ritual, removing their energy from a seemingly lifeless Eli Vance, while Alyx criestears of desolation. As the environment begins to reverse, the Vortigaunts release Eli, who appears to be more alive. The Advisors, who had been menacingly extracting information, retreat from the scene, leaving Eli unharmed and returning to their capsules. Alyx and Gordon, aided by Dog, encounter rode an elevator up to the surface, leaving the underground base. They transverse the White Forest in reverse, the antlion holes closing as they pass and the damaged bridge reconstructing as they \\"avoid\\" an encounter with a Combine Advisor. Resistance fighters retreat from their combat posts as Alyx becomes less injured on their journey, returning to the White Forest base where an unlaunch sequence is performed on a rocket meant to destroy the Combine's superportal. This undoes the communication blackout with the lost members of the resistance. **Half-Life 2: Episode One (Reversed)** Alyx and Gordon materialize outside the core of the Citadel, which is unexploding around them. They travel downward, passing Combine soldiers who appear increasingly disinterested in their presence. They slip past security systems, which become less compromised, and barriers reinforce themselves. Civilians walk backwards towards trains that will return them to their apartments in City 17, unwarned by Alyx and Gordon about the impending non-disaster. At the end of this reverse traversal, Alyx and Gordon are unguided by Dog out of the rubble of a building and go their separate ways, each headed off to the inverted mundanity of their lives before the uprising. **Half-Life 2 (Reversed)** Gordon Freeman wakes up on a backwards-moving train, departing from City 17 as the city undismantles itself. Returning the armaments given to him by allies such as Barney, he retreats from a growingly orderly cityscape. The revolutionary graffiti cleans itself, and the populace reluctantly returns to a state of subservience under the undiminished rule of the Combine. Reversing further, Gordon arrives at his \\"starting\\" point in Kleiner's lab where the experiment gets undone and the iconic crowbar is hung back in its place. As he steps into his HEV suit, it meticulously disassembles around him, NASA-style. **Half-Life (Reversed)** Gordon Freeman becomes less of a survivor and more a scientist, as the aliens are swept from the research facility. The facility rights itself: blast doors repair, emergency alarms turn off, and security systems reset. The disparate scientists gather around the anti-mass spectrometer as the alien materials are extracted from our realm. Finally, Gordon stands before the spectrometer, a normal employee in a non-chaotic lab. He avoids pushing the sample cart into the beam. The crystal is untouched, the resonance cascade undoing its very conception. With that, Black Mesa remains a place of rational science, the fabric of reality unbroken. Living through these backwards moments, Gordon Freeman is reduced from a savior of humanity to a man with a PhD and a crowbar that has no story to tell, and the whole tale ends with nothing more remarkable than the quiet beep of a timecard punching in for an ordinary—and uneventful—day at work."},{"instruction":"Ало блять","output":"Привет!

First and foremost, knights during the 15th century were members of the military aristocracy, trained from a young age in combat, horsemanship, and the use of weaponry. Their primary focus was on warfare, chivalry, and the code of conduct associated with their status. Technological innovations that they encountered were typically directly related to improvements in armor, weapons, or military tactics. Presented with kangaroo stilits, a 15th-century knight might react in the following ways: 1. Curiosity: Knights were often intrigued by novel inventions, especially those that could have military applications, so they might be curious about how the stilts work and if there is any strategic advantage to be gained from them. 2. Skepticism: The practical mindset of a knight dedicated to combat effectiveness could lead to skepticism over the usefulness of such a device in any traditional military sense. 3. Caution: A 15th-century person encountering a device as strange as modern kangaroo stilts would likely be cautious, if not outright afraid, of trying them out due to the risk of injury. They would have no context for something that would make a person bounce and stride in such an unusual way. 4. Experimentation: If a knight overcame the initial wariness and decided to try the stilts, it would probably be with a focus on whether they could serve any purpose in reconnaissance, allowing soldiers to peer over walls or obstacles, or possibly even in non-traditional forms of jousting or entertainment. 5. Entertainment: Aside from wartime uses, knights and nobles enjoyed various forms of entertainment and spectacle. If deemed safe and entertaining, kangaroo stilts might be integrated into festivals and tournaments as a novelty attraction. The use of kangaroo stilts would undoubtedly be challenging for a knight not used to balancing on such devices. Considering the importance of balance and agility in a knight's skill set, they may eventually become adept at using them, but it's unlikely that the stilts would be considered practical for warfare or any serious knightly endeavors. They would be more likely seen as a novelty or an amusing toy rather than a piece of equipment to be integrated into their martial practices."},{"instruction":"Now what about binoculars?","output":"Binoculars as we know them were not invented until the 17th century, well after the 15th century. If a 15th-century knight were somehow presented with a pair of modern binoculars, the reaction might include a mixture of awe, intrigue, and practical assessment of their uses. The reaction and subsequent use of the device could unfold in stages: 1. Surprise and Wonder: The knight would likely be astonished by the ability to see distant objects up close, as this would be a completely foreign concept. Optical devices before binoculars might include basic lenses or crude magnifying glasses, but nothing as advanced as binocular prisms that could enlarge distant images with clarity. 2. Suspicion or Fear: The knight might initially be suspicious or fearful of the binoculars, possibly considering them to be some form of witchcraft or magic due to their unfamiliarity with advanced optics. 3. Practical Evaluation: Once the initial shock wore off, the knight would likely begin to consider the practical applications of binoculars. Given that reconnaissance, scouting, and being able to assess enemy movements were essential military tactics, binoculars could have a significant impact on how a 15th-century knight planned and executed military campaigns. 4. Adopting for Use: A knight might use binoculars primarily for surveillance purposes to gain a tactical advantage. They could be used for observing enemy positions from a hidden location, assessing the size and equipment of opposing forces, and gaining insight into fortifications and terrain before planning an attack. 5. Secrecy: The advantage provided by such a device would be considered highly valuable, and the knight would likely keep the existence of the binoculars secret to maintain an edge over adversaries. 6. Distribution and Control: Assuming the knight were of high standing, and interested in producing more of these devices, he might commission skilled artisans to attempt to recreate the technology, though without a proper understanding of optics, this would likely be a daunting if not impossible task for the time. It's important to keep in mind that the response of a knight to binoculars would depend on their individual personality, openness to new technology, and immediate needs. Nonetheless, the presentation of modern binoculars to a 15th-century knight would certainly have the potential to cause astonishment and provoke a rethinking of tactical and strategic approaches to warfare and exploration."},{"instruction":"Now what about a car?","output":"Introducing a modern car to a 15th-century knight would be an astonishing and bewildering experience for them. Here's how such an encounter might unfold: 1. Astonishment: The knight would likely be initially amazed or even terrified by the sight and sound of a car — a metal contraption seemingly alive with its engine's roar and capable of movement without any visible means of propulsion like horses. 2. Suspicion: Belief systems of the 15th century could lead to suspicion of the car being a product of witchcraft, alchemy, or some sort of dark magic, similar to reactions to inexplicable phenomena of the era. 3. Curiosity: Once initial fears are overcome, the knight's curiosity would probably take over. They would likely examine the vehicle closely, perhaps even with some caution, touching it, listening to it, and trying to understand its material and function. 4. Understanding the Concept: Should the knight be able to move beyond their apprehensions and receive a demonstration of the car's capabilities — starting the engine, driving it, testing the horn and lights — the concept of a horseless carriage might start to sink in. 5. Practical Assessment: If the knight were to understand the car's function and its potential applications, he might quickly assess it as an incredibly powerful tool for transportation, vastly superior to horses in terms of speed and the absence of fatigue. However, the absence of roads suitable for car transport during that era might limit its presumed usefulness. 6. Strategic Military Thoughts: A knight, often preoccupied with warfare, would likely ponder the military applications of such a device. However, the noise, requirement for fuel (which would not be something they could easily comprehend or obtain), and the risk of malfunctions would make it less practical for stealth or reliable battlefield usage compared to horses. 7. Concerns about Control and Operation: The knight would probably have concerns about how to operate and control the vehicle, as well as interest in learning to master it, which could lead to a desire for instruction. 8. The Ripple Effect: A car's technology would be so far beyond the knight's time that, if shared, it could have a significant ripple effect on the society's understanding of mechanics, physics, and engineering. 9. Issues of Maintenance: Practical issues like maintenance, fuel, and infrastructure would pose significant problems. The knight and anyone else encountering the car would have no knowledge of or access to the resources and skills necessary to sustain the vehicle's operation. 10. Secrecy and Display: Depending on the knight's position and influence, they might attempt to keep the car secret as a means of personal or national advantage. Alternatively, the car could be displayed as a curiosity, marvel, or proof of the knight's own power and connections to otherworldly forces. Ultimately, a knight's reaction to a car would be shaped by a combination of awe, fear, practical considerations, and the struggle to understand its implications within the context of their time and knowledge. While the car's technology would be out of place and largely unsustainable in the 15th century, it would no doubt leave an indelible impression on anyone of that era who encountered it."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Keep in mind that, being a video game character, I've never made an actual burger on screen, but if I had to, here's how it might go: All right, let's make a burger, Gordon-style. We might not have the luxury of a fully stocked kitchen here in the resistance, but we’ve got ingenuity on our side. First things first, we’ll need some meat. Since the Combine aren’t exactly keen on us raising cattle, we'll have to be a bit creative. Dog, can you fetch us some protein rations from the last supply drop? Great, thanks, Dog. Now, let's see if we can scavenge some bread or something bread-like to hold this thing together. Aha! Some old pre-packaged buns from the back of this abandoned diner – they'll do. They're a little stale, but a quick toasting on our jury-rigged grill should bring them back to life. Next, we’ll need some flavor. I’ll grab a couple of those fresh-ish vegetables we got from the rooftop garden. A tomato and some lettuce should do, though they’ll be a bit wilted after that headcrab skirmish. Nothing a little water won’t fix. Condiments might be tricky. But you know what? There’s that old mustard packet from the ration crate. It's not gourmet, but it'll add a kick. As for cheese? Well, let’s just pretend we’re making a dairy-free burger today. Time to cook the patty. I've modified this little heat source from some leftover Combine tech – should cook it evenly enough. Got to keep an eye on it, though. Can't afford to waste any food around here. Buns are toasted, smudged with mustard, now let's assemble this thing. Meat, vegetables... and there we have it. The Resistance Burger. It's not fancy, but it'll refuel us for the fight ahead. Grilled with a side of resourcefulness and a dash of hope against all odds. Bet you never had a burger like this, huh, Gordon? Now let’s eat up before our next run-in with the Combine."},{"instruction":"I meant considering her character.","output":"Apologies for the confusion! Taking into account Alyx's character traits, here's a more character-driven approach to how Alyx Vance might make a burger: Hey, Gordon. Ready for a change of pace? Let's give this cooking thing a shot. They say even in the toughest times, everyone's got to eat, right? Let's put together one of those classic pre-Combine burgers. I bet we can scrounge up the parts if we put our heads together. First up, we need some protein for the patty. Remember when we passed by the old Wilson's farm on the outskirts of the quarantine zone? I snatched a bit of lab-grown meat from their storage. It's not your traditional ground beef, but with the Combine watching everything, it's as close as we're going to get. And you know me, I can make anything work. Now, for the bun. I'm thinking we use the bread we found stashed in Dr. Kleiner's lab. I swear, that man hides food everywhere. We'll toast it up on a piece of scrap metal. A little clean flame, something Barney picked up from those sneaky Vortigaunts – and we'll have our buns crispy in no time. Alright, so the gardens by the South Post have been yielding some decent veggies despite the striders terrorizing the area. I managed to grab a ripe tomato and some lettuce during our last run. We’ve got to add some greens to this burger for it to feel like the real deal—to remind us of what we're fighting for. As for cheese, well, that might be a luxury from another time, but let's just say I've secured a tiny stash of aged cheddar. Had to trade a few Combine batteries for it, but believe me, it's worth it. Condiments are a bit of a reach... but I found a few packets of ketchup and mustard left over from an old supply depot. Definitely expired, but they seem fine. It's the little things that keep spirits high. And you know, even the act of making this thing feels... I don't know, normal? I mean, as normal as anything can be these days. We piece together this burger, just like we piece together our lives in the shadows of City 17—improvising, making do, and creating moments of joy in a world gone dark. Alright, let's put it all together—meat, veggies, buns. Press it down a bit... and here we go, Gordon. The Alyx Vance Special: a burger against all odds, with a side of resistance. Now let's eat before our next mission. We'll need our strength to take down the Combine and bring back the world we remember—one where making a burger is just... making a burger."},{"instruction":"-I'd like to talk about the former American swimmer Michael Phelps, known from his participation in televised broadcasts of 5 Olympic Games, where he earned an impressive total of 23 gold medals and is considered one of the most accomplished athletes of all time.

Such a development would have been a departure from the established rules of the GoT universe, unless a supernatural or magical explanation was provided within the story, such as the resurrection powers of the Lord of Light or a new force. Here are some potential impacts on the story: 1. **Reshaped Alliances and Conflicts:** Resurrecting characters such as Robb Stark, Catelyn Stark (Lady Stoneheart in the books), or Eddard Stark could alter the dynamics of the factions in Westeros. The power struggle and claims to the Iron Throne would be vastly complicated with more contenders and their supporters. 2. **Vengeance and Justice:** Characters with a thirst for vengeance, like Oberyn Martell, could seek justice against their killers or contribute to ongoing conflicts. Meanwhile, the return of characters like Tywin Lannister could reignite old feuds and create new power struggles. 3. **Plot Twists and Surprises:** Bringing back characters like Littlefinger, who was known for his manipulative and strategic mind, could introduce new plot twists and shake up the political landscape once more. 4. **Changed Character Arcs:** The redemption arcs or narrative conclusions for characters like Theon Greyjoy or Sandor Clegane could have played out differently, with past figures influencing their choices and actions. 5. **Strained Storytelling:** Incorporating all these characters back into the story could have strained the narrative cohesion and made it difficult for the show to provide satisfying resolutions for each character within the constraints of a final season. 6. **Supernatural Elements:** The show would have had to expand on the fantasy elements, possibly giving more screen time to the White Walkers, the Lord of Light, or other mystical aspects to explain the mass resurrection. 7. **Fan Reactions:** The audience's response could have varied widely, from excitement at seeing favorite characters again to disapproval if it felt gimmicky or if it undermined the impact of their previous deaths. In essence, such a scenario would require a significant reimagining of the season 8 storyline, potentially leading to an entirely different conclusion to the \\"Game of Thrones\\" series.

Seriously and comically?","output":"If Gendry, the character from the \\"Game of Thrones\\" series, kept multiplying, it would result in a very different and quite wild development within the story universe of both the TV series and the \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" books by George R.R. Martin. Seriously: 1. Power Dynamics: The legitimization of multiple Gendrys would drastically shift the power balance in Westeros. As the bastards of Robert Baratheon, an army of Gendrys could potentially claim the Iron Throne and other lands, leading to civil wars or uprisings against the current powers. 2. Allegiances: Various factions might seek to ally with or oppose the multiplying Gendrys, creating new political alliances and conflicts. 3. Identity Crisis: With so many Gendrys, the concept of individual identity could be questioned, as they would all share the same lineage and possibly similar features. This could lead to intriguing storylines about self-perception and uniqueness in a feudal society. Comically: 1. A Sky Full of Hammers: Imagine scores of Gendrys, all blacksmiths by trade, crafting weapons and armor. There'd be so many war hammers in circulation that the common folk might start using them for everyday tasks, like tenderizing meat or knocking on doors. 2. Confusing Courtships: Westeros would see a peculiar problem as countless maidens claim to be courted by Gendry. The situation could lead to humorous incidents of mistaken identity. 3. A Rowing Fleet: Gendry’s infamous rowing scene could be turned into an armada of rowboats, with each Gendry determined to row to safety. They could inadvertently discover uncharted lands or start their own island nation of Gendrys. 4. New Sitcom \\"Everybody Loves Gendry\\": Each episode features different Gendrys dealing with the same situations in slightly varied ways. Hilarity ensues as they all show up at the same blacksmith convention or mistakenly court the same person. 5. GendryCon: A convention where all the Gendrys meet annually to discuss matters of state, armory designs, and rowing techniques. The highlight would be the look alike contest - which Gendry looks the most like Gendry? In both scenarios, the fantasy world would veer into the absurd with such a drastic departure from the original storylines. It's safe to say that the impact on the \\"Game of Thrones\\" universe would be as massive as it would be unpredictable, potentially overwhelming the drama with either chaos or comedy."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

Style","output":"\\"Rio\\" and \\"Super WHY!\\" are distinct in their respective styles, considering one is a theatrical release film and the other is an educational children's television series, though they share similarities in that they are both animated and aimed at family audiences.

The animation style is colorful, vibrant, and detailed, reflective of the film's festive setting in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. - The characters are anthropomorphic animals with human-like expressions and personalities.

Its funding credits have included organizations such as the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB), the U.S. Department of Education, and various foundations and companies with an interest in early childhood education. Additionally, it may receive funding from PBS stations and their viewers. On the other hand, \\"Rio\\" is a big-budget animated feature film produced by Blue Sky Studios and was distributed by 20th Century Fox (now owned by Disney).
