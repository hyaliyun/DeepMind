Define this established sequence of numbers as (N). Our goal is to prove that (N) is not a power of 2. 2. **Understanding Sequence Periodicity**:     - Consider any number (A) in the sequence from (11111) to (99999).     - Let's examine (10^{5} A). Since (10^{5} = 100000), rewriting (10^{5} A) will simply move the decimal 5 places to the right.     - This can be analyzed using modular arithmetic. Specifically, evaluating (10^{5} A mod 11111):         [         10^5 equiv 1 pmod{11111}         ]     - Thus, for any integer (A),         [         10^{5}A equiv A pmod{11111}         ] 3. **Combining All Numbers**:     - Now, when we chain all numbers (11111, 11112, ldots, 99999) in some arbitrary order, the combined number (N) can be expressed modulo (11111).      - Mathematically,       [       N = sum_{k=11111}^{99999} n_k cdot 10^{5k}       ]     - Because (10^5 equiv 1 pmod{11111}),       [       N mod 11111 = sum_{k=11111}^{99999} n_k mod 11111       ]     - Each term (n_k) in (sum_{k=11111}^{99999} n_k) taken modulo 11111 will maintain equivalence in modular arithmetic. 4. **Cyclic Sum Behavior**:     - The cumulative sum of all numbers from (11111) to (99999) exhibits properties akin to an arithmetic sequence. Summing these yields,       [       S = sum_{i=11111}^{99999} i       ]     - This (S) is naturally divisible by (11111) by virtue of the arithmetic sequence properties.

Then (|S| = n) and ( S ) is sum-free for sufficiently large ( p ).    **Proof:**    - Since ( alpha ) is a primitive ( n )-th root of unity modulo ( p ), the multiplicative subgroup generated by ( alpha ) is:      [      S = {1, alpha, alpha^2, ldots, alpha^{n-1} }.      ]      Clearly, (|S| = n).    - Assume for contradiction there exist ( a, b, c in S ) (not necessarily distinct) such that:      [      a + b equiv c pmod{p}.      ]      Specifically, assume:      [      1 + alpha^k equiv alpha^m pmod{p}.      ]      This implies ( 1 + alpha^k - alpha^m equiv 0 pmod{p} ).    - Consider polynomials ( f(X) = X^n - 1 ) and ( g(X) = (X + 1)^n - 1 ).    - The statement ( (X + 1)^n - 1 = 0 ) has roots involving ( -1 ) shifted ( n )-th roots of unity, while ( X^n - 1 = 0 ) has ( n )-th roots of unity.    - Applying the Lemma above, we find that these two polynomials are relatively prime if ( n notequiv 0 pmod{3} ), hence for sufficiently large ( p ), they have no common roots modulo ( p ).    - Therefore, for sufficiently large primes ( p ), ( 1 + alpha^k notequiv alpha^m pmod{p} ). 5. **Conclusion:**    By choosing a sufficiently large prime ( p ) such that the conditions hold, we can always find a sum-free multiplicative subgroup of ( mathbb{F}_{p} ) with size at least ( n ).

We also add one stone to the first bucket and (operatorname{gcd}(a, b)) stones to the second bucket. 2. **Expressions for Stones in the Buckets:**    - Let (s) be the number of stones in the first bucket, and (t) be the number of stones in the second bucket.    - The sum (p) of the numbers on the board progresses, causing the number of stones added to the first and second bucket to change. 3. **Sum of Numbers on the Blackboard and Expression for (s):**    - Initially, if the numbers (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n) are on the board:      [      p = a_1 + a_2 + cdots + a_n      ]    - The total number of moves is (n-1), so:      [      s = p - n      ] 4. **Expression for (q):**    - Define:      [      q = 0 cdot a_1 + 1 cdot a_2 + 2 cdot a_3 + cdots + (n-1) cdot a_n      ]    - Since every (a_i geq 1):      [      q leq (n-1)p - frac{n(n-1)}{2}      ] 5. **Changes in (q) and (t) through Moves:**    - If a pair (a_i) and (a_j) (with (i < j)) transforms, (q) increases by:      [      (j-1)a_i - (i-1)(a_i - 1) geq a_i      ]    - This suggests (q - t) never decreases. 6. **Bounding (t):**    - Initially after the first move:      [      q = frac{(n+2)(n-1)}{2}, quad t = 1      ]    - Thus, generally:      [      t leq (n-1)s + frac{n(n-1)}{2} - frac{(n+2)(n-1)}{2} + 1      ]      Simplifying, we get:      [      t leq (n-1) s - (n-2)      ]    - Thus:      [      frac{t}{s} < n-1      ] 7. **Structure of the Ratio (frac{t}{s}):**    - Initially with a single move:      [      frac{t}{s} = 1      ]    - To prove that (frac{t}{s}) can take any rational value in the interval ((1, n-1)), we use induction. 8. **Induction Base Case:**        - For (n = 2):      - (s) and (t) will both be equal to (a-1) after (a-1) moves. 9. **Inductive Step:**    - For (n-1), assuming true, involve algorithm (A) which leads to structures:      [      text{Create the number } a^{n-2}      ]      [      text{Apply algorithm A sequentially } a text{ times}      ]    - This leads to (t = a^{n-2}(a-1)(n-1)) and (s = a^{n-1} - 1). 10. **Final Structure for Ratios:**     - To show all rational (frac{p}{q} in (1, n-1)):       [       frac{p}{q} = frac{a^{n-2}(a-1)(n-1) + b}{a^{n-1} - 1 + b}       ]     - Choose appropriate (a) based on the congruence condition:       [       a equiv 1 pmod{p-q} implies text{numerator is positive for large } a       ] 11. **Conclusion:**     - The possible values of the ratio (frac{t}{s}) are all rational numbers in the interval:       [       boxed{[1, n-1)}       ]"},{"instruction":"The maximum value of the function f(x)=2cos^2x+sin xcos x1 is ______.","output":"Solution: The function f(x)=2cos^2x+sin xcos x-1   =cos 2x+ frac{1}{2}sin 2x   = frac{sqrt{5}}{2}(sin thetacos 2x+cos thetasin 2x)   = frac{sqrt{5}}{2}sin (2x+theta).

Identify the problem's requirement that Sofia appended numbers until the entire large number became a multiple of 12. Recall that a number is divisible by 12 if and only if it is divisible by both 3 and 4. 3. First, check divisibility by 4:     - For a number to be divisible by 4, its last two digits must form a number that is divisible by 4.     - Thus, the last number appended should make the last two digits divisible by 4. 4. Calculate and verify the divisibility by 4:     - The sequence ends at 81. Sofia continues with 82, 83, etc.     - The closest number to 81 that is divisible by 4 is (84). Hence, 84 should be checked.     - However, we must ensure the total number is divisible by both 3 and 4.  5.

Will the first runner catch up with the second runner again? If so, how many laps will the second runner complete by that time?","output":"1. Let's denote the speed of the first runner as (V_1) and the speed of the second runner as (V_2).    2. From the initial conditions of the problem, we know that the first runner completes ( frac{3}{2} ) circles by the time the second runner completes ( frac{1}{2} ) circles. This implies that the first runner is faster. 3. We can express this relation mathematically:    [    V_1 = 3V_2    ]    This means the first runner’s speed is exactly three times the speed of the second runner. 4. The second runner then doubles his speed. Thus, the new speed of the second runner is:    [    2V_2    ]    which is still less than the speed of the first runner ((3V_2)). Therefore, the first runner remains faster. 5. Next, let's determine the number of circles the second runner completes before being caught by the first runner again. Assume that the second runner runs ( k ) circles before being caught up. 6. The distance run by the second runner can be represented as:    [    k cdot S = 2V_2 cdot t    ]    where ( S ) is the length of one circle, and ( t ) is the time taken for this interval. 7. The distance run by the first runner in the same time interval ( t ) will be:    [    (k+1) cdot S = V_1 cdot t    ] 8. Dividing the two equations to eliminate ( t ), we get:    [    frac{(k+1) cdot S}{k cdot S} = frac{V_1}{2V_2}    ] 9. Given that ( V_1 = 3V_2 ):    [    frac{(k+1)}{k} = frac{3V_2}{2V_2} = frac{3}{2}    ] 10. Solving for ( k ):     [     2(k+1) = 3k     ]     [     2k + 2 = 3k     ]     [     k = 2     ] 11. Thus, during the time the second runner completes 2 circles, the first runner completes 3 circles (catching up with the second runner). 12.

A placement is stable if the product of any three consecutive numbers is equal to ( n ). 2. **Analyzing the Stability Condition:**    Given the stability condition ( a_i a_{i+1} a_{i+2} = n ) for all ( i ), we can infer that:    [    a_i a_{i+1} a_{i+2} = a_{i+1} a_{i+2} a_{i+3} = n    ]    This implies:    [    a_i = a_{i+3}    ]    Therefore, the sequence of numbers must repeat every three positions. 3. **Case 1: ( 3 nmid n ):**    If ( n ) is not divisible by 3, then all numbers must be equal to a constant number ( a ). This is because if ( a_i = a_{i+3} ) and the product of any three consecutive numbers is ( n ), then:    [    a^3 = n    ]    Hence, ( n ) must be a perfect cube. Let ( n = k^3 ). We need to count the number of perfect cubes between 3 and 2020 that are not divisible by 3.    - The smallest cube greater than or equal to 3 is ( 2^3 = 8 ).    - The largest cube less than or equal to 2020 is ( 12^3 = 1728 ).    We need to exclude cubes that are divisible by 3. The cubes of numbers divisible by 3 within this range are ( 3^3, 6^3, 9^3, 12^3 ), which are ( 27, 216, 729, 1728 ).    Therefore, the cubes not divisible by 3 are ( 2^3, 4^3, 5^3, 7^3, 8^3, 10^3, 11^3 ), which are ( 8, 64, 125, 343, 512, 1000, 1331 ). There are 7 such numbers. 4. **Case 2: ( 3 mid n ):**    If ( n ) is divisible by 3, we can place the numbers in the sequence ( 1, 1, n, 1, 1, n, ldots ). This sequence satisfies the stability condition because:    [    1 cdot 1 cdot n = n    ]    We need to count the multiples of 3 between 3 and 2020.    - The smallest multiple of 3 is 3.    - The largest multiple of 3 less than or equal to 2020 is ( 3 times 673 = 2019 ).    Therefore, there are 673 multiples of 3 in this range. 5. **Total Count:**    Adding the counts from both cases, we get:    [    7 text{ (cubes not divisible by 3)} + 673 text{ (multiples of 3)} = 680    ] The final answer is (boxed{680})"},{"instruction":"The total area of all the faces of a rectangular solid is 34text{cm}^2, and the total length of all its edges is 28text{cm}.

First, consider the case where not all ( a_i ) are equal. Suppose there exists ( i ) such that ( a_i neq a_{2022} ). Since ( Q(x) ) is a polynomial of odd degree, it has at least one real root. Therefore, there exists some ( x ) such that ( a_i Q(x) + b_i = a_{2022} Q(x) + b_{2022} ). This implies that ( P(a_i Q(x) + b_i) = P(a_{2022} Q(x) + b_{2022}) ). 3.

However, the equation ( P(a_1 Q(x) + b_1) + P(a_2 Q(x) + b_2) + ldots + P(a_{2021} Q(x) + b_{2021}) = P(a_{2022} Q(x) + b_{2022}) ) implies that the sum of several terms of the same sign equals a single term, which is impossible unless ( P(x) ) changes sign, indicating a real root.  4. Now consider the case where all ( a_i ) are equal, say ( a_i = a ) for all ( i ). The equation simplifies to:    [    P(a Q(x) + b_1) + P(a Q(x) + b_2) + ldots + P(a Q(x) + b_{2021}) = P(a Q(x) + b_{2022})    ]    If no ( b_i ) is equal to ( b_{2022} ), we can compare the leading coefficients of the polynomials on both sides. For large ( x ), the leading term of ( P(a Q(x) + b_i) ) will dominate, and since ( Q(x) ) is a 2021-degree polynomial, ( a Q(x) ) will also be a 2021-degree polynomial.  5. The left-hand side has 2021 terms of the form ( P(a Q(x) + b_i) ), each contributing a leading term of the form ( a_{2021} x^{2021} ) (where ( a_{2021} ) is the leading coefficient of ( P )). The right-hand side has only one such term. Therefore, for large ( x ), the left-hand side will grow much faster than the right-hand side unless ( P(x) ) has a root, which balances the equation. 6.

To prove the existence of a unique pair of points ( M ) and ( N ) on the sides of the triangle such that the segments formed by the line through these points and ( I ) are parallel to the sides of the triangle, consider the symmetric properties relative to the angle bisectors. 3.

The theorem states:      - An infinite graph G can be colored with k colors if and only if any finite subgraph of it can be colored with k colors.    - If G is infinite with chi(G) > n, there exists a finite subgraph H with chi(H) > n. We can then remove dfrac{n(n-1)}{2} edges from H and since G was connected, putting back the vertices from G - H keeps the graph connected.    - Therefore, we will assume G is finite for the rest of the proof. 3. **Edge Count and Chromatic Number**:    - Let m be the number of edges in the finite graph G.    - We use the inequality for the chromatic number:      [      chi(G) leq frac{1}{2} + sqrt{2m + frac{1}{4}}      ]    - This inequality can be derived from the fact that if G is colored with k = chi(G) colors, then G has at least one edge connecting any two color classes. Therefore:      [      m geq frac{k(k-1)}{2}      ]    - For our case, since chi(G) > n, we have:      [      m geq frac{(n+1)n}{2} = frac{n(n-1)}{2} + n      ]    - This shows that a graph with chi(G) geq n+1 has enough edges so that we can remove dfrac{n(n-1)}{2} of them. 4. **Induction Hypothesis**:    - We will use induction on |G| + n.    - **Base Case**: For small graphs, the statement is trivially true.    - **Induction Step**: Assume the statement is true for all graphs with |G| + n leq k. 5. **Induction Step**:    - Consider a vertex v in G that does not disconnect the graph when removed.    - Let G' = G - v.    - If chi(G') > n, by the induction hypothesis, we can remove a set M of edges from G' with |M| geq dfrac{n(n-1)}{2}, and G' remains connected. Then G will also remain connected after removing these edges.    - If chi(G') leq n, then chi(G') = n (since chi(G) > n and removing v reduces the chromatic number by at most 1). By the induction hypothesis, we can remove a set M of edges from G' with |M| geq dfrac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2}, and G' remains connected.    - Since deg(v) geq n, we can remove at least n-1 edges incident to v from G. Therefore, we can remove at least:      [      dfrac{(n-1)(n-2)}{2} + (n-1) = dfrac{n(n-1)}{2}      ]      edges from G while keeping it connected. Thus, we have shown that it is possible to remove dfrac{n(n-1)}{2} edges from a connected graph G with chi(G) > n while keeping it connected. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"What sequence is formed by the products of the corresponding terms (a_{k}, b_{k}, c_{k} ldots) of several given geometric progressions?

To address the second question, consider the more general function a_{k}^{p} b_{k}^{q} c_{k}^{r} cdots. Here, the terms are raised to different powers but fixed for respective sequences. 7. Using the terms of geometric progressions a_k, b_k, c_k, ldots from step 1, we have:    [    a_{k}^{p} = (a cdot r_1^{k-1})^p = a^p cdot (r_1^{p})^{k-1}    ]    [    b_{k}^{q} = (b cdot r_2^{k-1})^q = b^q cdot (r_2^{q})^{k-1}    ]    [    c_{k}^{r} = (c cdot r_3^{k-1})^r = c^r cdot (r_3^{r})^{k-1}    ] 8. Combining these terms:    [    a_{k}^{p} cdot b_{k}^{q} cdot c_{k}^{r} cdots = (a^p cdot (r_1^{p})^{k-1}) cdot (b^q cdot (r_2^{q})^{k-1}) cdot (c^r cdot (r_3^{r})^{k-1}) cdots    ] 9.

The net increase on her overall stock investment wealth by the end of the second year was 26 percent. This means that the value of her investment after the second year is ( P + 26% times P ). Setting the two expressions for the value after the second year equal to each other, we get: ( (P + frac{x}{100}P) - 30% times (P + frac{x}{100}P) = P + 26% times P ) Simplifying both sides: ( P(1 + frac{x}{100}) - 0.30 times P(1 + frac{x}{100}) = P(1 + 0.26) ) ( P(1 + frac{x}{100})(1 - 0.30) = P(1.26) ) ( P(1 + frac{x}{100})(0.70) = P(1.26) ) Now, we can cancel out ( P ) from both sides since it's a common factor and not equal to zero: ( (1 + frac{x}{100})(0.70) = 1.26 ) ( 0.70 + 0.70 times frac{x}{100} = 1.26 ) Now, let's solve for ( x ): ( 0.70 times frac{x}{100} = 1.26 - 0.70 ) ( frac{x}{100} = frac{0.56}{0.70} ) ( x = frac{0.56}{0.70} times 100 ) ( x = 0.8 times 100 ) ( x = 80 ) So, the percentage increase in the first year was boxed{80}  percent."},{"instruction":"Vasya has picked 8 cells on a chessboard such that no two of them are in the same row or column.

What is the minimum number of turns after which Petya can be guaranteed to win?  Solution Steps: 1. **Introduction:** Start by understanding the chessboard and the placement strategy. Petya needs to place 8 rooks on the board such that no two rooks threaten each other, according to Vasya's 8 marked positions. 2. **First Turn Strategy:**     - Petya places 8 rooks along one of the main diagonals (either from the top-left to the bottom-right or the top-right to the bottom-left) of the chessboard. 3. **Understanding the Outcomes:**     - If Petya wins on the first turn, the number of rooks pointed by Vasya is even.     - If not, it implies that an odd number of rooks land on Vasya's marked cells. This means that one of Vasya's marked squares is on the diagonal and one marked square is not on the diagonal. 4. **Second Turn Strategy:**     - On the second turn, Petya adjusts the strategy based on the number of rooks being pointed out by Vasya.     - Consider a new layout of 8 rooks that captures the scenario of one marked square remaining unaccounted for. Petya can set rooks in a configuration where they form intersections assuming an even spread and maximized reposition. 5. **Ensuring a Winning Configuration:**     - Petya adjusts for each configuration where a square was missed, ensuring that all possible odd configurations (from detection in step 3) are covered, making any undetected sets result in Vasya pointing an even number of rooks. Essentially, Petya employs combinatorial logic ensuring the next layout aligns into even count detection zones. 6. **Detailed Example and Proof:**     - Assume Vasya marks cell (A) (main diagonal) and some cell (B) not on the main diagonal. Lay out rooks ensuring their new placement on a effective counter-diagonal adjusting even count of occupied cells.     - Use rooks to cover as follows: Place rooks around positions ((i, j)), avoiding conflicts with the new check zone, covering each of (A, B) yet accounting their mutual influence out of odd sum formation.

The goal is to ensure that no matter how many pieces are requested (up to 127), Xiaoming can provide exactly that number by selecting the appropriate bags. 2. We need to find the minimum number of bags necessary to achieve this. Let's use a strategy based on the binary representation of numbers, ensuring each possible sum can be achieved. When a number is represented in binary, each digit represents a power of 2. For instance,  [ 127 = (1111111)_2 ] This can be broken down to a sum of powers of 2: [ 127 = 2^6 + 2^5 + 2^4 + 2^3 + 2^2 + 2^1 + 2^0 = 64 + 32 + 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 ] So, Xiaoming can use the following quantities of pieces in each bag: - 1 chess piece - 2 chess pieces - 4 chess pieces - 8 chess pieces - 16 chess pieces - 32 chess pieces - 64 chess pieces Each number from 1 to 127 can now be expressed as the sum of some subset of these quantities. This ensures that any number of chess pieces up to 127 can be provided by selecting the appropriate combination of bags. We summarize: 3.

Since there are 6 possible outcomes for each roll, and the cube is rolled twice, there are a total of 6 * 6 = 36 possible outcomes.

Here, ( Y ) is some point on line ( BC ). 3. **Effect of Moving ( Y ) on ( G ):**    - When point ( Y ) moves along ( BC ), observe that point ( G ) remains unchanged.

This suggests that there's a rigid motion (rotation by ( 60^circ )) relative to ( E ), and this rotation is derived from the properties of the triangle and the given parallel condition. 5. **Conclusion from Movements:**    - We can infer that the linear movement and constancy of ( G )'s position mean that for specific geometric configurations dependent on triangle properties, such as rotations, the lengths satisfy the required equality.

It records a problem as follows: There is a piece of wood whose length is unknown. When measured with a rope, there are 4.5 feet of rope left.

If the length of the wood is denoted as x feet, the equation can be written as () A: frac{1}{2}(x+4.5)=x1 B: frac{1}{2}(x+4.5)=x+1 C: frac{1}{2}(x+1)=x4.5 D: frac{1}{2}(x1)=x+4.5","output":"To solve this problem, let's denote the length of the wood as x feet. The problem gives us two conditions: 1. When the rope is used to measure the wood, there are 4.5 feet of rope left. This implies that the rope is longer than the wood by 4.5 feet, but it doesn't directly give us an equation. 2. When the rope is folded in half and used to measure the wood again, there is 1 foot of wood left. This means the half-length of the rope is 1 foot shorter than the wood. From the second condition, we can derive an equation. If the half-length of the rope measures the wood with 1 foot of wood left, it implies that the half-length of the rope plus 1 foot equals the length of the wood. Since the rope's full length is x + 4.5 feet (the wood's length plus the 4.5 feet left from the first measurement), half of this length should be frac{1}{2}(x + 4.5). This half-length, when used to measure the wood, leaves 1 foot of wood, which means the wood's length is 1 foot more than this half-length, or equivalently, the half-length of the rope is 1 foot less than the wood's length. Therefore, we can write the equation as: [ frac{1}{2}(x + 4.5) = x - 1 ] This equation matches the conditions given in the problem perfectly, showing how the length of the wood relates to the length of the rope when folded in half and when not.

Janice cuts her ribbons into equal lengths of 2 m, while Jasmine cuts her ribbons into some lengths. There was no remainder in both cases, and the shortest possible length of ribbon given to them was 10 m. What is the length of each piece of ribbon Jasmine cut?","output":"Since Janice cuts her ribbons into equal lengths of 2 meters without any remainder, the length of the ribbon given to both Janice and Jasmine must be a multiple of 2 meters. Given that the shortest possible length of ribbon given to them was 10 meters, and there was no remainder for Jasmine either, we can deduce that the length of the ribbon Jasmine cuts must also be a factor of 10 meters. The factors of 10 are 1, 2, 5, and 10. Since Janice cuts her ribbons into lengths of 2 meters, we can eliminate 2 meters as a possible length for Jasmine's cuts because the problem implies that Jasmine cuts her ribbons into some lengths different from Janice's. Therefore, the possible lengths for Jasmine's cuts are 1 meter, 5 meters, or 10 meters. However, since the ribbon is the shortest possible length of 10 meters and Jasmine cuts it without any remainder, the length of each piece of ribbon Jasmine cut cannot be 10 meters because that would imply she didn't cut the ribbon at all. So, the possible length of each piece of ribbon Jasmine cut is either 1 meter or 5 meters. Since 1 meter would not be considered a different length from Janice's 2-meter cuts (as it would imply more cuts but of a smaller size), the most logical length for Jasmine's cuts would be 5 meters, which is different in size from Janice's cuts and would result in no remainder when cutting a 10-meter ribbon. Therefore, the length of each piece of ribbon Jasmine cut is boxed{5}  meters."},{"instruction":"a newly designed problem, a square of side 4 is dissected such that E and F are midpoints of two adjacent sides and AG is perpendicular to BE.

First, let's calculate the total man-hours it took for the 45 men to dig 40 meters deep working 8 hours per day: Total man-hours = Number of men × Number of hours per day × Number of days Since we don't know the number of days, we'll just keep it as a variable (D) for now. Total man-hours for 40 meters = 45 men × 8 hours/day × D days Now, let's calculate the total man-hours required for the additional depth with 75 men (45 original + 30 extra) working 6 hours per day: Total man-hours for additional depth = (45 men + 30 men) × 6 hours/day × D days Total man-hours for additional depth = 75 men × 6 hours/day × D days We assume that the amount of work done (in terms of volume of earth dug) is directly proportional to the number of man-hours worked. Therefore, the ratio of the total man-hours for the 40 meters to the total man-hours for the additional depth should be equal to the ratio of the depths: (45 men × 8 hours/day × D days) / (75 men × 6 hours/day × D days) = 40 meters / Additional depth Now we can solve for the additional depth: (45 × 8) / (75 × 6) = 40 / Additional depth (360) / (450) = 40 / Additional depth 0.8 = 40 / Additional depth Now, we solve for the additional depth: Additional depth = 40 / 0.8 Additional depth = 50 meters So, the desired depth they want to reach is 40 meters (the original depth) + 50 meters (the additional depth) = boxed{90}  meters."},{"instruction":"The sequence (left{a_{n}right}) is a geometric series with all real terms.

These points lie on the parabola ( y = x^2 ). 2. **Distances**:     We must show that the distance between any two points ( P_i ) and ( P_j ) ( (i < j) ) is irrational. The distance between ( P_i ) and ( P_j ) is given by the Euclidean distance formula:     [     |P_i P_j| = sqrt{(j - i)^2 + (j^2 - i^2)^2}     ]     Simplifying inside the square root:     [     |P_i P_j| = sqrt{(j - i)^2 + (j^2 - i^2)^2} = sqrt{(j - i)^2 + (j - i)^2(i + j)^2}     ]     Factor out ( (j - i)^2 ):     [     |P_i P_j| = sqrt{(j - i)^2 [1 + (i + j)^2]} = (j - i) sqrt{1 + (i + j)^2}     ] 3. **Irrationality**:     Next, show that ( sqrt{1 + (i + j)^2} ) is irrational. Since ( (i + j)^2 ) is an integer,     [     (i + j)^2 < 1 + (i + j)^2 < (i + j + 1)^2     ]     Therefore, ( sqrt{1 + (i + j)^2} ) lies strictly between two consecutive integers, making it an irrational number. Consequently, ( |P_i P_j| = (j - i) sqrt{1 + (i + j)^2} ) is the product of a non-zero integer ( j - i ) and the irrational number ( sqrt{1 + (i + j)^2} ), which must also be irrational. 4. **Triangle Area**:     Show that any triangle formed by points ( P_i, P_j, P_k ) has a rational area.

This is a worst-case scenario for the hunter because it provides no information about the rabbit's perpendicular deviation from ( ell ). 5. **Hunter's Movement:**    - The hunter, to guarantee the win, must move along the line ( ell ) because she has no information about the rabbit's perpendicular movement.    - After ( lfloor 500d rfloor ) moves, the rabbit will be at point ( A ). 6. **Distance Calculation:**    - Suppose the hunter is at point ( X ) on line ( ell ), where ( HX = lfloor 500d rfloor ).    - Using the Pythagorean Theorem, the distance between the hunter and the rabbit is:      [      sqrt{(500d)^2 + 1^2} = sqrt{250000d^2 + 1}      ]    - This distance is greater than ( sqrt{d^2 + frac{1}{2}} ). 7. **Conclusion:**    - By repeating this strategy, the rabbit can ensure that the distance ( d ) increases over time.    - Applying this claim ( 2 times 10^4 ) times, the distance ( d ) can be extended to 100 in under ( 10^9 ) moves.

The function will approach undefined as ( x ) approaches 1 or -1.

Recall the double-angle identity for sine: sin 2x = 2sin x cos x, and the Pythagorean identity: sin^2x + cos^2x = 1. We can rewrite f(x) as follows: [ f(x) = 2sin^2x + 2sin x cos x. ] Factor out 2sin x: [ f(x) = 2sin x(sin x + cos x). ] Now, applying the Pythagorean identity to express sin^2x: [ f(x) = 2(1 - cos^2x) + 2sin x cos x. ] Combine the terms to have a single trigonometric function: [ f(x) = 1 - 2cos^2x + 2sin x cos x. ] Next, we recognize that the terms -2cos^2x and 2sin x cos x form part of the cosine double-angle identity: cos 2x = cos^2x - sin^2x. We thus rewrite f(x) as: [ f(x) = 1 - (cos^2x - sin^2x) = 1 - cos 2x. ] Now replace - cos 2x with its equivalent sine form (utilizing a phase shift): [ f(x) = 1 - cos 2x = 1 + sinleft(2x - frac{pi}{2}right). ] This, however, does not yield the simplest form for finding the maximum value. Notice that: [ - cos 2x = sinleft(2x - frac{pi}{2}right), ] but since we want to express the function in the form of sin(theta) where theta has a smaller phase shift, we can use a frac{pi}{4} phase shift instead: [ f(x) = 1 + sqrt{2}sinleft(2x - frac{pi}{4}right). ] This sine function has an amplitude of sqrt{2} and will have its maximum value when the sine part is equal to 1.

Here’s how it looks when shifted for one step back:          [      A_{n-1, k} = A_{n-2, k} + A_{n-3, k} + A_{n-4, k} + ldots + A_{n-k, k} + 2^{n-1-k}      ]        - Subtracting A_{n-k, k} from both sides yields:          [      A_{n-2, k} + A_{n-3, k} + ldots + A_{n-k+1, k} = A_{n-1, k} - A_{n-k, k} - 2^{n-1-k}      ] 7. Substituting this result back into our initial combined recurrence relation, we get:        [    A_{n, k} = A_{n-1, k} + (A_{n-1, k} - A_{n-k, k} - 2^{n-1-k}) + 2^{n-k}    ]        Simplifying, we have:        [    A_{n, k} = 2A_{n-1, k} - A_{n-k, k} + 2^{n-1-k}    ] 8. To find the probability p_{n, k} of having at least one k-series in n flips, note that it is proportional to A_{n, k}:        [    p_{n, k} = frac{2A_{n, k}}{2^n} Rightarrow A_{n, k} = 2^{n-1}p_{n, k}    ] 9. Substituting A_{n, k} = 2^{n-1} p_{n, k} into the earlier recurrence relation yields:        [    2^{n-1} p_{n, k} = 2 cdot 2^{n-2} p_{n-1, k} - 2^{n-k-1} p_{n-k, k} + 2^{n-1-k}    ] 10. Dividing through by 2^{n-1} to simplify, we derive the required recurrent formula for p_{n, k}:     [     p_{n, k} = p_{n-1, k} - frac{1}{2^k} p_{n-k, k} + frac{1}{2^k}     ]      # Conclusion: [ boxed{p_{n,k}=p_{n-1,k}-frac{1}{2^k}p_{n-k,k}+frac{1}{2^k}} ] This formula allows sequential computation of the probability p_{n, k}."},{"instruction":"Suppose that the angles of triangle PQR satisfy [cos 2P + cos 2Q + cos 2R = 1.] Two sides of the triangle have lengths 7 and 24.

Let's assume Q(x) has two pairs of complex conjugate roots since finding exact roots for a quartic without specific coefficients or a graph is complex. This assumption must be validated or calculated exactly if more information (like a graph) is provided. Based on this assumption: - The product of all zeros is real and positive (as calculated in B), so if there are non-real zeros, their product must also be real (product of conjugates). Hence, the product of the non-real zeros is assumed to be less than 6 but greater than 0. - (C) Assuming two non-real zeros are complex conjugates, their product is positive. Comparing this to the known values and assuming the typical behavior of roots, this product could plausibly be the smallest if the real zeros sum to a value greater than 6. - (E) Without specific roots, calculating the exact sum of real roots is speculative. Assuming some symmetry in root distribution and typical quartic root behavior, the sum might exceed 6.

So the distance between the sequences is boxed{7}. (2) Let a_1 = p where p neq 0 and p neq pm 1. From the recursive relation a_{n+1} = frac{1 + a_n}{1 - a_n}, we get a_2 = frac{1+p}{1-p}, a_3 = -frac{1}{p}, a_4 = frac{p-1}{p+1}, and a_5 = p. Therefore, a_1 = a_5, and the sequence repeats every 4 terms. Thus, for sequence {b_n}, we have b_{4k-3} = 2, b_{4k-2} = -3, b_{4k-1} = -frac{1}{2}, and b_{4k} = frac{1}{3}, where k is a positive integer. Similarly, for sequence {c_n}, we have c_{4k-3} = 3, c_{4k-2} = -2, c_{4k-1} = -frac{1}{3}, and c_{4k} = frac{1}{2}. Calculating the distance for every four terms gives sum_{i=1}^{4} |b_i - c_i| = frac{7}{3}. To ensure that the total distance is less than 2016, we can take the largest multiple of 4 that keeps the sum under the threshold: frac{7}{3} times 864 = 2016. Therefore, we must have m < 3456. The maximum number of terms m to achieve a distance less than 2016 is boxed{3455}. (3) Assume T has 17 or more elements. Since each element in {a_n} is either 0 or 1, the tuples formed by the first three terms of the sequence (a_1, a_2, a_3) can only be one of the eight possibilities: (0,0,0), (1,0,0), (0,1,0), (0,0,1), (1,1,0), (1,0,1), (0,1,1), (1,1,1). With 17 or more sequences, there are at least three sequences that share the same first three terms. Let's denote these sequences as {c_n}, {d_n}, and {f_n}, where c_1 = d_1 = f_1, c_2 = d_2 = f_2, and c_3 = d_3 = f_3. Given the minimum distance restriction, at least three terms must differ between {c_n} and {d_n} for the indices 4 to 7. Say, c_4 neq d_4, c_5 neq d_5, and c_6 neq d_6. Due to the binary nature of these sequences, f_4 will match either c_4 or d_4, and similarly for f_5 and f_6. Thus, there should be at least two matches in either {f_n} with {c_n} or {f_n} with {d_n} for indices 4, 5, and 6. This would imply that either sum_{i=1}^{7} |f_i - c_i| leq 2 or sum_{i=1}^{7} |f_i - d_i| leq 2, which contradicts the minimum distance of three.

Since it's given that a + b < 0, we can infer that 2a > 0, which leads to the conclusion that a > 0.

Given the inequalities 3a + b > 0 and a + b < 0, we can rewrite them as -3a < b < -a.

Since a > 0, the value of y increases as x moves away from the vertex on either side.  - The point (-3, m) is to the left of the vertex, and since the parabola opens upwards, it will have a higher y-value compared to points closer to the vertex. - The point (2, n) is to the right of the vertex but closer than (4, t). - The point (4, t) is further to the right of the vertex, and since the parabola opens upwards, its y-value (t) will be higher than that of (2, n) but lower than (-3, m).

According to the problem, there are half as many fourth graders as fifth graders, so the number of fourth graders is f/2. Furthermore, there are three times as many third graders as fourth graders, so the number of third graders is 3(f/2) = 1.5f.     2. **Calculate the total minutes run by each grade:**    - Third graders run 14 minutes each. Therefore, the total minutes run by third graders is 14 times 1.5f = 21f.    - Fourth graders run 18 minutes each. Therefore, the total minutes run by fourth graders is 18 times (f/2) = 9f.    - Fifth graders run 8 minutes each.

Thus, it has some limit ( lim_{n to infty} a^{frac{1}{n}} = c ). 6. **Analyzing the Limit (c):**    - The subsequence (left{a^{frac{1}{2n}}right}) has the same limit, so:      [      c = c^2 quad text{(because } a^{frac{1}{n}} = left( a^{frac{1}{2n}} right)^2 text{)}      ]    - This implies:      [      c = 0 quad text{or} quad c = 1      ] 7. **Conclusion with Bound Check:**    - Since (a > 1), it follows that (a^{frac{1}{n}} geq 1).    - Hence, (c geq 1), which implies (c = 1). 8. **Final Limiting Behavior:**    Since (a^{frac{1}{n}} to 1) as (n to infty), and by squeezing theorem:    [    a^{-frac{1}{k_n}} leq a^{x_n} leq a^{frac{1}{k_n}}    ]    as ( n to infty ), both bounds approach 1.

The inequality condition given in the problem translates to ensuring a geqslant x - x^2 ln x for all x in [frac{1}{2}, 2]. We define a new function h(x) = x - x^2 ln x to find its extrema within the given interval. First, let's find the derivative of the function g(x):  g'(x) = frac{d}{dx}(x^3 - x^2 - 5) = 3x^2 - 2x = x(3x - 2).  From this, we can see that g(x) is decreasing on the interval [ frac{1}{2}, frac{2}{3}] and increasing on [frac{2}{3}, 2]. The values of g(x) at the endpoints of the interval are:  g(frac{1}{2}) = frac{1}{8} - frac{1}{4} - 5 = -frac{41}{8},   g(2) = 8 - 4 - 5 = -1,  and, therefore, the maximum value of g(x) on the interval [frac{1}{2}, 2] is g(2) = -1. For the inequality f(x_1) - g(x_2) geqslant 2 to hold for any x_1, x_2 in [frac{1}{2}, 2], it must be the case that f(x) geqslant 1 for all x in this interval. This translates to the inequality frac{a}{x} + xln x geqslant 1, which simplifies to a geqslant x - x^2 ln x. Now, we focus on analyzing h(x) = x - x^2 ln x. We need to determine its first and second derivatives:  h'(x) = 1 - ln x - 2x ln x,   h''(x) = -frac{1}{x} - 2 ln x.  Since h''(x) < 0 for all x in [frac{1}{2}, 2], this means that h(x) is concave down over the entire interval, and hence h'(x) is decreasing throughout the interval. Noting that h'(1) = 0, we find that h'(x) > 0 for x in [frac{1}{2}, 1] and h'(x) < 0 for x in [1, 2]. Thus, h(x) increases on the interval [frac{1}{2}, 1] and decreases on the interval [1, 2].  Consequently, the maximum value of h(x) occurs at x = 1, where h(1) = 1. This implies that for all x in the interval, h(x) leqslant h(1) = 1.

These describe lines in the (a)-(b) plane forming a bounded region. 6. **Determine the area of the bounded region**:    - Draw the unit square representing all possible values of (a) and (b) each ranging from 0 to 1.    - The line (b = 3a) is a line through the origin with a slope of 3.    - The line (a = 3b) is a line through the origin with a slope of (frac{1}{3}).

Substitute back these values into the expression: [ overline{xyxyxy} = x cdot 101010 + y cdot 10101 ] 6. Notice that both terms have a common factor 10101: [ overline{xyxyxy} = 10101 cdot (10x + y) ] 7. We need to find the prime factors of 10101. We start by testing small prime numbers: [ 10101 div 3 = 3367 quad text{(integer, hence divisible by 3)} ] [ 3367 div 7 = 481 quad text{(integer, hence divisible by 7)} ] [ 481 div 13 = 37 quad text{(integer, hence divisible by 13)} ] 8.

If we consider all possible line segments between any two of these ( n ) points, the total number of segments is:    [    frac{n(n-1)}{2}    ]    With ( n = 2m + 1 ), this becomes:    [    frac{(2m + 1)(2m)}{2} = m(2m + 1)    ]    Thus, there are:    [    C_{n}^{2} = C_{2m+1}^{2} = frac{(2m + 1)(2m)}{2} = m(2m + 1)    ]    This shows that indeed, every pair of points has a line segment between them, guaranteeing a path of line segments between any points, including the ( V_i )'s. 2. **Step 2: Inductive Hypothesis**    Assume that the statement holds for ( n = k ), where ( k geqslant 2m + 1 ). This implies that for any collection of ( k ) points with ( m ) line segments, there exists a sequence of points ( V_{0}, V_{1}, cdots, V_{m} ) with the necessary connections. 3. **Inductive Step: Prove for ( n = k + 1 )**    Consider ( k + 1 ) points.

Define the differences ( x_i = b_i - a_i ), ( y_i = c_i - b_i ), and ( z_i = d_i - c_i ).

Thus, ( T_l = T_m = T_k cup {j} ) and ( S_{T_l} = S_{T_k} + alpha_j ). 6. **Complement and contradiction:**    Let ( bar{T_i} ) be the complement of ( T_i ) in ( V ) and ( bar{S_{T_i}} = sum_{i in bar{T_i}} alpha_i ).

Let ( V' = {1 le i le n mid alpha_i = 0} ), ( S_x' = sum_{i in V'} x_i ), ( S_z' = sum_{i in V'} z_i ), and ( S_{xz}' = sum_{i in V'} (x_i + z_i) ). There is a subset ( T_{half}' ) of ( V' ) such that:    [    sum_{i in T_{half}'} x_i = frac{S_{xz}'}{2}    ]    Partition the remaining stones into two groups ( A_2 ) and ( B_2 ):    [    A_2 = {a_i, c_i mid i in T_{half}'} cup {b_i, d_i mid i notin T_{half}'}    ]    [    B_2 = {b_i, d_i mid i in T_{half}'} cup {a_i, c_i mid i notin T_{half}'}    ]    Each group has exactly two stones of each color ( i ).

For the interval ((-infty, c_1]),    [    f(x) = sum_{i=1}^{50} (a_i - x) - sum_{j=1}^{50} (b_j - x) = sum_{i=1}^{50} a_i - sum_{j=1}^{50} b_j    ]    Similarly, on the interval ([c_{100}, infty)),    [    f(x) = sum_{i=1}^{50} (x - a_i) - sum_{j=1}^{50} (x - b_j) = left(sum_{j=1}^{50} b_j - sum_{i=1}^{50} a_iright)x    ]    Let (m = sum_{i=1}^{50} a_i - sum_{j=1}^{50} b_j). Therefore:    [    f(x) = m text{ and } f(x) = -m    ]    respectively, where (m neq 0) because the number of roots is finite. 4. As we move to the right along the number line, each time we cross a point (c_i), the slope of (f(x)) changes by (pm 2) because crossing each (c_i) corresponds to changing the sign of one absolute value term. 5. Therefore, the slope of (f(x)) at any interval is an even integer. Each time (f(x)) changes its sign, it must pass through zero, confirming a root. 6. On each of the 50 segments ([c_1, c_3], ldots, [c_{97}, c_{99}]), the function (f(x)) can have at most one root due to the linear behavior on each interval. 7. It follows that the number of roots must be an odd number since (f(x)) changes its sign at each crossing and starts from (m) and ends at (-m). Hence, the maximum number of such intervals where (f(x)) can change its sign can be 49. 8. We can confirm that if for example, the roles of (a_i) are played by the numbers (1, 4, 5, 8, 97, 100) and the roles of (b_i) are played by the numbers (2, 3, 6, 7, 94, 95, 98, 99, frac{1}{10}), the equation (f(x) = 0) will have exactly 49 roots. # Conclusion: [ boxed{49} ]"},{"instruction":"the Cartesian coordinate system xOy, point P(x_0,y_0) is on the unit circle O.

Consider a right triangle (ABC) with (angle ABC = 90^circ). Let's denote the hypotenuse as (AC), with (A) and (C) as the vertices opposite and adjacent to the right angle respectively. 2. Construct the midpoint (O) of the hypotenuse (AC). This implies (AO = OC = frac{AC}{2}). 3. From point (B), draw a median (BD) to the hypotenuse (AC), such that (D) is the midpoint of (AC). Therefore, (BD) is the median. 4. By properties of right triangles, the median (BD) from the right-angle vertex (A) to the hypotenuse (AC) is half the hypotenuse:    [    BD = frac{AC}{2}    ] 5. Recognize that if (O) is the center of a circle passing through points (A), (B), and (C), then (angle ODC = 90^circ). 6. Draw a circle centered at (O) with radius (OD). This circle includes the points (A) and (C). 7. Now, determine the appropriate radius for this circle. From (A), draw an arc with radius (m_a) (where (m_a) represents the length of the median to one of the legs). The intersection of this arc with the smaller circle determines point (D). 8. Draw the line (CD). Extend this line until it intersects the larger circle again at point (B). 9. The triangle (BDC) is the required right triangle with (AC) as the hypotenuse and (BD) as the median to one of the legs. **Approach 2: Using Side Lengths** 1. Construct a secondary triangle (AEO) based on given side lengths:    [    AO = frac{1}{2}b quad text{(where (b) is the length of the hypotenuse)}    ]    [    AE = frac{2}{3}m_a quad text{(where (m_a) is the length of the median to one of the legs)}    ]    [    OE = frac{1}{6}b    ] 2. Utilizing these lengths, draw the triangle (AEO). This small right triangle helps in constructing the desired right triangle. 3. The final step is to extend the triangle (AEO) into the full triangle by completing the other vertices and ensuring the relative measures correspond to the initial set lengths of the hypotenuse and the median. 4. The result is a right triangle (ABC) with (AC) as the hypotenuse and the correct median length (BD). Conclusively, once drawn correctly, the right triangle (ABC) follows the properties given.

Let A, B, C, and D be the given four points on the plane, with no three of them collinear. 2. Define D_1 as the point of intersection of the lines symmetric to the lines AD, BD, and CD with respect to the corresponding angle bisectors of triangle ABC.        - Symmetric lines to AD and BD with respect to the bisector of angle BAC intersect at D_1.    - This process applies for each pair of lines, leading to the same point D_1. 3. In the previous related problem, it was proven that the pedal circles of points D and D_1 with respect to triangle ABC coincide. 4. Similarly, define the point A_1 as the point of intersection of the lines symmetric to the lines BA, CA, and DA with respect to the corresponding angle bisectors of triangle BCD.        - Symmetric lines to BA and CA with respect to the bisector of angle CBD intersect at A_1.    - This process applies for each pair of lines, leading to the same point A_1. 5. It can be shown that A_1 and D_1 are symmetric to each other with respect to the line CB. This follows from the definition of symmetry with respect to angle bisectors.        - For example, if we take reflections and symmetry properties, they ensure these points are symmetric about CB. 6. Consequently, the pedal circles of points D (or D_1) with respect to triangle ABC and A (or A_1) with respect to triangle BCD both pass through the midpoint of D_1A_1.        - The midpoint here serves as a critical point since it's invariant under reflections and involves angle bisectors symmetry. 7. By defining analogous points B_1 and C_1 relative to their respective triangles (i.e., symmetries involving point sets), we observe that:        - Each of these pedal circles passes through the midpoints of the respective segments joining points like A_1, B_1, C_1, and D_1.     8. Ultimately, this implies that all four pedal circles share a common point – the midpoint discussed. 9. Therefore, the four pedal circles associated with any one point with respect to the triangle formed by the other three points have a common point of intersection.

For example, ( D(12) = { 1, 5, 7, 11 } ). The goal is to find all positive integers ( n ) such that the elements in ( D(n) ) can be arranged in an arithmetic sequence. 1. **Examining Small Values of ( n )**:    - For ( n leq 4 ), we check each value:      - ( n = 1 ), ( D(1) = { 1 } )      - ( n = 2 ), ( D(2) = { 1 } )      - ( n = 3 ), ( D(3) = { 1, 2 } )      - ( n = 4 ), ( D(4) = { 1, 3 } )    Clearly, none of these ( D(n) ) for ( n leq 4 ) form an arithmetic sequence other than trivial cases. Therefore, ( n leq 4 ) does not satisfy the requirements. 2. **Considering Larger Odd Values of ( n )**:    - Let ( n ) be an odd positive integer greater than 4.    - Since ( n ) is odd and greater than 4, both 1 and 2 are in ( D(n) ).    - For ( D(n) ) to form an arithmetic sequence, all integers from 1 to ( n-1 ) must be in ( D(n) ).    This means ( D(n) ) must be the set of all integers less than ( n ) that are coprime to ( n ). This is only possible if ( n ) is a prime number greater than or equal to 5. 3. **Considering ( n ) Even and Not a Power of 2**:    - Let ( n = 2k ) where ( k geq 5 ) is an odd integer.    - Elements ( k, k-2, k+2 ) should all be in ( D(n) ).    Let’s consider such ( k ) can’t be only constructed by odd prime factors because it will contradict the definition being coprime to n in general and breaks apart the structure. So, it can't form an arithmetic sequence effectively. 4. **Considering ( n = 2^t ) for ( t ge 3 )**:    - Let ( n = 2^t ) for ( t ge 3 ).    - For ( t = 3 ), ( n = 8 ), ( D(8) = { 1, 3, 5, 7 } ), which is an arithmetic sequence with difference 2.    Similarly, higher powers of 2 (i.e., ( n = 2^t )) also yield sets forming arithmetic sequences. 5. **Other Composite Even Numbers**:    - Consider other even numbers like ( n = 2m ) with ( m geq 5 ) and ( m ) being odd:      - Elements ( m-2, m-4, m+2, m+4 ) need to be carefully checked in ( D(n) ).      - Contradictorily in such cases, subcycles can cause improper arrangement failing to maintain core arithmetic sequence property. # Conclusion From the steps above, we conclude that the positive integers ( n ) for which ( D(n) ) can be arranged in an arithmetic sequence are: [ boxed{ left{ n mid n text{ is a prime number} geq 5 text{ or } n = 2^t text{ where } t geq 3 right} } ]"},{"instruction":"Given the function f(x) = ax^2 + a^2x + 2b  a^3, for x in (2, 6), we have f(x) > 0, and for x in (infty, 2) cup (6, +infty), we have f(x) < 0.

Given the problem involves evaluating sequences formed by 7-digit numbers ranging from 0000000 to 9999999 and showing that the total 70000000-digit number is divisible by 239. 2. Consider the congruence:    [    10^7 equiv 1 pmod{239}    ]    This can be interpreted as any power of 10 that fits the form 10^{7k} equiv 1 pmod{239} where k is a positive integer. 3. Suppose A and B are two 7-digit numbers. We need to represent the number formed by putting A and B next to each other, overline{A B}:    [    overline{A B} = A cdot 10^7 + B    ]    Using the earlier congruence, we find:    [    A cdot 10^7 equiv A cdot 1 equiv A pmod{239}    ]    Hence,    [    A cdot 10^7 + B equiv A + B pmod{239}    ] 4.

Computing [PMQ] as frac{1}{2} cdot 20 cdot 7.5 = 75 (since it shares the height with triangle PQR), we have [PMN] = frac{75}{2} = 37.5. 2. **Apply Properties of Perpendicular Bisector**:    - Given that T lies on the perpendicular bisector of angle QPR, assume balanced proportions. If QR = x, by applying the Triangle Midsegment Theorem to triangle PQR, we estimate MN = frac{1}{2} QR = frac{x}{2}.  3. **Calculate Area of triangle PMT**:    - Since S is on the perpendicular bisector and also on overline{MN}, assume SM = SN.     - [PMT] = frac{1}{2} cdot [PMN] = frac{37.5}{2} = 18.75. 4. **Compute Area of Quadrilateral SMTQ**:    - The area of SMTQ includes [PMT] and half of triangle PQM, which is frac{75}{2}.

The prime factorization of ( 315 ) is:    [    315 = 3 times 3 times 5 times 7 = 3^2 times 5 times 7    ]    Therefore, the prime factorization of ( 315^2 ) is:    [    315^2 = (3^2 times 5 times 7)^2 = 3^4 times 5^2 times 7^2    ]    The divisors of ( 315^2 ) are all the products of the form ( 3^a times 5^b times 7^c ) where ( 0 leq a leq 4 ), ( 0 leq b leq 2 ), and ( 0 leq c leq 2 ). 7. **Check the smallest ( n ):**    We need to find the smallest ( n ) such that ( 315 + n ) is one of these divisors.

Given two partitions and four outer walls, the total perimeter would be 2x + 4(24 - 2x) = 48, considering the double count for partition lengths but that the partitions don't count towards the perimeter. Hence, another side of the rectangle could be denoted as 24 - 2x. Our objective is to maximize the area S of the rectangle which is given by:  S = x(24 - 2x) = -2x^2 + 24x.  We note that 0 < x < 12, because x must be less than half of the total length of material if it is to form a side of a rectangle. The function S(x) = -2x^2 + 24x represents a downward opening parabola. The maximum value for S occurs at the vertex of the parabola, which can be located by using the formula -frac{b}{2a} for a quadratic function in standard form ax^2 + bx + c. Applying this formula, we get the x coordinate of the vertex:  x = -frac{24}{2(-2)} = 6.  To further confirm the maximum area occurs at x = 6, we can utilize the second derivative test or observe that a = -2 is negative, indicating the maximum of parabola.

One of these smaller triangles is similar to the original triangle. 2. **Identify the properties of similar triangles**: In geometry, when two triangles are similar, their corresponding angles are equal, and their corresponding sides are proportional. 3. **Relationship of angles through angle bisectors**:     - In our problem, one of the smaller triangles is similar to the original triangle.     - Let the angles of the original triangle be (A), (B), and (C). 4. **Angle bisector theorem application**:     - The point where the angle bisectors meet is the incenter of the triangle.     - When the incenter is connected to the vertices, it divides the angle into two equal halves. 5. **Similar triangle property**:     - If a smaller triangle is similar to the original, it must have angles proportional to (A), (B), and (C). 6. **Identify the angles of the original triangle**:     - Let the angles of the smaller triangle be (frac{A}{2}), (frac{B}{2}), and (frac{C}{2}). 7. **Determine the relationships**:     - Because the smaller triangle’s angles are proportional to the original triangle (and equal because of similarity), we consider the relationship that all angles in the triangle add up to (pi) radians (or 180 degrees). 8. **Form relationships among angles**:     - Since the angles sum up to (pi):     [     A + B + C = pi     ]     - Let’s determine the ratio in which the angles are divided due to similarity.

So we take the absolute value: ( |y - x| = frac{x}{8} ) Now, to find the percentage increase from ( x ) to ( y ), we divide the difference by the original number ( x ) and multiply by 100: ( text{Percentage increase} = left( frac{|y - x|}{x} right) times 100 ) ( text{Percentage increase} = left( frac{frac{x}{8}}{x} right) times 100 ) ( text{Percentage increase} = left( frac{1}{8} right) times 100 ) ( text{Percentage increase} = 12.5% ) Therefore, the second number is boxed{12.5%}  more than the first number."},{"instruction":"For how many positive integers n does frac{1}{n} yield a terminating decimal with a nonzero tenths digit?","output":"First, we know that frac{1}{n} yields a terminating decimal if and only if n = 2^a times 5^b for non-negative integers a and b.

According to the information given, Ram is half as efficient as Krish, so we can write this as: R = 1/2 * K It is also given that Ram would take 24 days to complete the task if he worked alone. Since the amount of work is the same, we can say that Ram's work for one day (his daily work rate) is 1/24 of the task. Now, let's find Krish's daily work rate. Since Ram is half as efficient as Krish, Krish's daily work rate would be twice that of Ram's. So, Krish's daily work rate would be: K = 2 * (1/24) = 1/12 of the task per day Now, let's find out how long it would take for Ram and Krish to complete the task if they worked together. Their combined daily work rate would be the sum of their individual daily work rates: Combined daily work rate = R + K = (1/24) + (1/12) = (1/24) + (2/24) = 3/24 = 1/8 of the task per day To find out how many days it would take for them to complete the task together, we take the reciprocal of their combined daily work rate: Time taken = 1 / (Combined daily work rate) = 1 / (1/8) = 8 days So, Ram and Krish would take boxed{8}  days to complete the task if they worked together."},{"instruction":"Calculate the volume of the region in threedimensional space defined by the inequalities |x|+|y|+|z|le2 and |x|+|y|+|z2|le2.","output":"1. **Describe the first region**: In the octant where x ge 0, y ge 0, z ge 0, the inequality |x| + |y| + |z| le 2 describes a larger octahedron.

However, this approach is incorrect because multiplying by 10 does not necessarily preserve the sum of digits. For example, if ( n = 5 ), then ( 10 times 5 = 50 ), and the sum of the digits of 50 is ( 5 + 0 = 5 ), which is not equal to ( 10 ). 3. **Correct approach**: We need to find a multiple of ( n ) such that the sum of its digits equals ( n ). Let's denote this multiple by ( m ). 4. **Constructing the multiple**: Consider the number ( m = 10^{n-1} + 10^{n-2} + cdots + 10^1 + 10^0 ). This number is a sum of ( n ) terms, each being a power of 10. Explicitly, ( m = 111ldots1 ) (with ( n ) ones). 5. **Sum of digits of ( m )**: The sum of the digits of ( m ) is ( 1 + 1 + cdots + 1 ) (with ( n ) ones), which equals ( n ). 6. **Checking if ( m ) is a multiple of ( n )**: We need to verify that ( m ) is a multiple of ( n ). Notice that ( m ) can be written as:    [    m = sum_{k=0}^{n-1} 10^k = frac{10^n - 1}{9}    ]    We need to show that ( frac{10^n - 1}{9} ) is a multiple of ( n ). 7. **Using properties of numbers**: By properties of modular arithmetic, ( 10^n equiv 1 pmod{n} ) for some ( n ). This implies that ( 10^n - 1 equiv 0 pmod{n} ), meaning ( 10^n - 1 ) is divisible by ( n ). 8. **Conclusion**: Since ( 10^n - 1 ) is divisible by ( n ), it follows that ( frac{10^n - 1}{9} ) is also divisible by ( n ). Therefore, ( m ) is a multiple of ( n ) and has a sum of digits equal to ( n ).

So, the speed of the train in m/s is: 72 kmph * (5/18) m/s/kmph = 20 m/s The train crosses the platform in 26 seconds, so the distance covered by the train while crossing the platform is: Distance = Speed * Time Distance = 20 m/s * 26 s = 520 meters This distance is the combined length of the train and the platform. To find the length of the train, we subtract the length of the platform from the total distance: Length of the train = Distance covered - Length of the platform Length of the train = 520 meters - 260 meters Length of the train = 260 meters Therefore, the length of the goods train is boxed{260}  meters."},{"instruction":"What is the first nonzero digit to the right of the decimal point of the fraction frac{1}{198}?","output":"1.

This means each side of the new triangle is:    [    frac{a}{2R} = sin alpha, quad frac{b}{2R} = sin beta, quad frac{c}{2R} = sin gamma    ] 5. **Verification of Triangle Inequality**: We need to verify that the sides sin alpha, sin beta, and sin gamma satisfy the triangle inequality. For any triangle with angles alpha, beta, gamma:    [    alpha + beta + gamma = pi    ]    Since alpha, beta, gamma are angles of a triangle, they are all less than pi and greater than 0. Therefore, sin alpha, sin beta, and sin gamma are all positive and less than or equal to 1. 6. **Triangle Inequality**: For any three sides of a triangle, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side. We need to check:    [    sin alpha + sin beta > sin gamma, quad sin beta + sin gamma > sin alpha, quad sin gamma + sin alpha > sin beta    ]    Since alpha, beta, gamma are angles of a triangle, the above inequalities hold true due to the properties of the sine function in the interval (0, pi). Therefore, the sides sin alpha, sin beta, and sin gamma do indeed form a triangle.

Moreover, since f(x) is odd, if x = a is a zero, then x = -a is also a zero, except for the zero at the origin.

At what point along the road should a well be dug so that the sum of the distances from the well to the houses is minimized?","output":"1. **Analyzing the Key Location Points**:     We need to minimize the sum of distances from the well to the three houses (A), (B), and (C), which are equidistantly placed along a straight road in a village.          Suppose house (B) is positioned between houses (A) and (C). We know each pair of houses is separated by 50 meters. 2. **Considering Point B without Intermediate Point**:     - If there was no house (B), we could bury the well anywhere on the segment connecting (A) and (C) without any loss of generality in minimizing the overall distance to both houses. This is because the total distance would simply be linear between the two end points (A) and (C).          Since (A) and (C) are equidistant with (B) at the center, any point between (A)-(C) summing up the distances would not change the optimization.      3. **Incorporating House (B**:          - With the introduction of house (B) between (A) and (C), a logical solution arises. Intuitively, placing the well at house (B) would effectively minimize the distance since it's exactly in the middle of (A) and (C). 4. **Conclusion**:          Consequently, by symmetry and optimal point placement logic, the minimum sum of distances from the well to each house occurs at point (B).

The number of ways in which two people draw balls with consecutive numbers, and all three drawn numbers are not consecutive, is ______.","output":"To solve this problem, we need to consider the conditions under which two people draw balls with consecutive numbers, but all three numbers drawn are not consecutive.  First, let's consider the possible pairs of consecutive numbers: (1,2), (2,3), (3,4), and (4,5). For each pair, there are three scenarios based on which two of the three people draw these consecutive numbers.  However, to ensure that all three numbers are not consecutive, the third ball drawn must not create a sequence of three consecutive numbers with the pair. This means if the pair is (1,2), the third ball cannot be 3; if the pair is (2,3), the third ball cannot be 1 or 4, and so on. For the pairs (1,2) and (4,5), there are 3 possible people combinations for each pair and 3 possible numbers for the third ball (excluding the number that would make the sequence consecutive). This gives us 3 times 3 times 2 = 18 ways. For the pairs (2,3) and (3,4), there are also 3 possible people combinations for each pair, but there are 2 possible numbers for the third ball (excluding the two numbers that would make the sequence consecutive for each case). This gives us 3 times 2 times 2 = 12 ways. Adding these together, we get 18 + 12 = 30 ways. However, upon reviewing the calculation, it appears there was a mistake in the initial explanation. The correct approach should consider all valid combinations without over-constraining the choices for the third ball based on the specific pairs and ensuring not to form a consecutive trio inadvertently.

For the polynomial x^3 + 6x^2 + 11x + 6 = 0, the constant term a_0 = 6 and the leading coefficient a_n = 1. Therefore, the possible rational roots are factors of 6, i.e., pm 1, pm 2, pm 3, pm 6. 2. **Descartes' Rule of Signs**: This rule helps to determine the number of positive and negative real roots of a polynomial.    - For positive roots, count the sign changes in the polynomial x^3 + 6x^2 + 11x + 6:      - x^3 to 6x^2 (no change in sign),      - 6x^2 to 11x (no change in sign),      - 11x to 6 (no change in sign).      - **Sign changes: 0**.

Thus, there are 3 or 1 negative real roots. 3. **Testing Rational Roots**: Since we know there are no positive roots, we test the negative rational roots:    - For x = -1: (-1)^3 + 6(-1)^2 + 11(-1) + 6 = -1 + 6 - 11 + 6 = 0.    - For x = -2: (-2)^3 + 6(-2)^2 + 11(-2) + 6 = -8 + 24 - 22 + 6 = 0.    - For x = -3: (-3)^3 + 6(-3)^2 + 11(-3) + 6 = -27 + 54 - 33 + 6 = 0.

The goal is to determine the ratio ( frac{b}{a} ), where ( a ) and ( b ) represent the number of ways Albert and Berta can tile the floor plan, respectively. 2. **Define the sets of colorless and colored covers**: Let ( A ) be the set of all possible colorless tiling configurations that Albert can create, and let ( B ) be the set of all possible colored tiling configurations that Berta can create. 3. **Map colored covers to colorless covers**: We define a mapping ( varphi: B rightarrow A ) by \\"forgetting\\" the color of the tiles. This means that each element in ( B ) (a colored cover) maps to an element in ( A ) (a colorless cover). 4. **Determine the preimage size**: To find the ratio ( frac{b}{a} ), we need to determine how many distinct colored tilings can correspond to each colorless tiling. Each unit square in the floor plan can be weighted with ( sqrt{2} ), representing the number of ways to color each tile. 5. **Calculate ways to color dominoes and tetrominoes**:     - Each domino (covering 2 squares) can be colored in ( 2 ) ways, because there are 2 colors.     - Each T-tetromino (covering 4 squares) can be colored in ( 4 ) ways, because there are 4 colors. 6. **Application of the product rule**:     - Suppose the colorless tiling consists of ( k ) dominoes and ( l ) tetrominoes. Thus, ( 2k + 4l = n ).     - The number of ways to color ( k ) dominoes is ( 2^k ).     - The number of ways to color ( l ) tetrominoes is ( 4^l ).     - Therefore, the number of ways to color a fixed colorless tiling is ( 2^k cdot 4^l ). 7. **Translating this into floor plan properties**:     - We recognize that ( 2^k cdot 4^l = 2^k cdot (2^2)^l = 2^{k + 2l} ).     - Since ( 2k + 4l = n ), then ( k + 2l = frac{n}{2} ).     - Hence, the number of ways to color a fixed colorless tiling is ( 2^{frac{n}{2}} ). 8. **Determine the ratio ( frac{b}{a} )**:      - Since each colorless tiling can be colored in ( 2^{frac{n}{2}} ) ways, the number of colored tilings ( b ) is ( 2^{frac{n}{2}} ) times the number of colorless tilings ( a ).     - Therefore, ( frac{b}{a} = 2^{frac{n}{2}} ). # Conclusion [ boxed{frac{b}{a} = 2^{frac{n}{2}}} ]"},{"instruction":"Each vertex of a regular pentagon corresponds to an integer such that the sum of these five integers is positive.

Suppose among these integers associated with three consecutive vertices x, y, z, the middle number y < 0. We can perform the following operation: replace the integers x, y, z with x+y, -y, z+y, respectively. As long as there are still negative numbers among the five integers, continue this operation. Will this operation definitely terminate after a finite number of steps? Explain why. 1. Let the 5 integers be x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5, arranged in counter-clockwise order at the vertices of the regular pentagon, and given that the sum x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5 > 0.     2. Consider the objective function:    [    fleft(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5right) = left(x_1 - x_3right)^2 + left(x_2 - x_4right)^2 + left(x_3 - x_5right)^2 + left(x_4 - x_1right)^2 + left(x_5 - x_2right)^2    ] 3. Suppose x_3 < 0. After one operation, the integers change as follows: left(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5right) becomes left(y_1, y_2, y_3, y_4, y_5right) = left(x_1, x_2 + x_3, -x_3, x_4 + x_3, x_5right). 4. At this point, the new objective function value fleft(y_1, y_2, y_3, y_4, y_5right) is:    [    begin{aligned}    f(y_1, y_2, y_3, y_4, y_5) &= (x_1 - x_3)^2 + (x_2 + x_3 - x_4)^2 + (-x_3 - x_5)^2 + (x_4 + x_3 - x_1)^2 + (x_5 - (x_2 + x_3))^2     &= (x_1 - x_3)^2 + 4x_1x_3 + (x_2 - x_4)^2 + x_3^2 + 2x_3(x_4 - x_1) + (x_3 - x_5)^2 + 4x_3x_5 + x_5^2 + 2x_3(x_2 - x_5)    end{aligned}    ] 5. Simplifying the subtraction of the original function from the new function, we get:    [    begin{aligned}    & fleft(y_1, y_2, y_3, y_4, y_5right) - fleft(x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4, x_5right)     &= x_3^2 + 2x_3(x_2 - x_5) + 4x_1x_3 + 4x_3x_5 + x_3^2 + 2x_3(x_4 - x_1)     &= 2x_3(x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5) < 0    end{aligned}    ] 6. Since x_3 < 0 and x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5 > 0, we have:    [    2 x_3 (x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5) < 0    ]    which indicates that the value of the objective function f decreases by at least 2 in every operation. 7. Given that f, which is a sum of squares, can only take non-negative integer values, it must eventually reach a minimum value. Therefore, this process will terminate after a finite number of operations. # Conclusion: [ boxed{text{Yes, the operation will definitely terminate after a finite number of steps.}} ]"},{"instruction":"Joan has 10 books, Tom has 38 books, Sarah has 25 books, and Alex has 45 books.

Hence, if a knight says \\"Among the remaining inhabitants, more than half are liars,\\" it must be true.     - After removing the knight himself, we have 2000 inhabitants remaining.     - For the knight's statement to hold, the number of liars among the 2000 must be more than 1000.     - Thus, if there is at least one knight, we have the inequality:         [         n - 1 > frac{2000}{2} = 1000 implies n > 1001         ]     **ii.

Thus, the new tuple ((x, y, z, v_1)) is also a solution. 4. **Minimizational Hypothesis:**    Since (x + y + z + v) is minimal, we must have:    [    v leq v_1 implies v leq frac{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}{v}    ]    Thus:    [    v^2 leq x^2 + y^2 + z^2 implies v leq sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}    ] 5. **Bounding (lambda):**    From the equation (x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + v^2 = lambda xy zv), we can estimate:    [    lambda xy zv = x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + v^2 leq x v + y v + z v + v cdot frac{lambda xyz}{2} = left(3 + frac{lambda}{2}right) x y z v    ]    Therefore:    [    lambda leq 3 + frac{lambda}{2} implies 2lambda leq 6 + lambda implies lambda leq 6    ] 6. **Analysis Based on Parity:**    - If (x, y, z, v) are all odd, then the left-hand side is divisible by 4, but (lambda xyz v) is odd, which means (lambda) must be divisible by 4.    - If there is one or three even numbers among (x, y, z, v), then the right-hand side is even, and the left-hand side is odd, leading to a contradiction.    - If there are two or four even numbers, then (x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + v^2) gives a remainder 2 modulo 4, but (lambda xyz v) is divisible by 4, leading to a contradiction. 7. **Special Case where (x, y, z, v) are All Even:**    Consider (x = 2a, y = 2b, z = 2c, v = 2d):    [    lambda 2a cdot 2b cdot 2c cdot 2d leq 8abc d leq x^2 + y^2 + z^2 + v^2 = 8(a^2 + b^2 + c^2 + d^2)    ]    [    lambda abcd leq left(frac{3}{4} + frac{lambda}{2}right) abcd    ]    Therefore:    [    lambda leq frac{3}{4} + frac{lambda}{2} implies lambda = 1    ] # Conclusion: Thus, the only positive integer values of (lambda) that allow for a positive integer solution to the given equation are (lambda = 1) and (lambda = 4).

Now we analyze the sign of the quadratic expression in the intervals determined by these roots: 1. For x < -2, all terms in the factored form, (x - 1)(x + 2), are negative, so their product is positive. Thus, {x^{2}}+x-2 > 0 holds true. 2. For -2 < x < 1, one term in the factored form is negative, while the other is positive. So their product is negative, meaning that {x^{2}}+x-2 < 0 in this interval. 3. For x > 1, both terms in the factored form are positive, and their product is also positive. Thus, {x^{2}}+x-2 > 0 holds true.

Now that the argument is within the known range, substitute the known value of f(x):    f(dfrac{5pi}{6})=0 5.

To prove that line l passes through a fixed point, we can rewrite the equation of the line l independently from k. The equation of the line is kx - y + 1 + 2k = 0.

From this we can see that, regardless of the value of k, when x = -2, y will always be equal to 1. Therefore, line l will always pass through the point (-2, 1), which is the fixed point. 2. To find the value of k given that line l, l_1, and l_2 intersect at a single point, we first need to find the intersection point of lines l_1 and l_2.

From relationship 3, we can express T in terms of F: T = F / 0.75 Using relationship 1, we can express C in terms of T: C = 0.10 * T Now, let's substitute T from relationship 3 into relationship 1: C = 0.10 * (F / 0.75) Now, let's use relationship 4 to express F in terms of the number of pure Gala trees: T - F - C = 39 F / 0.75 - F - 0.10 * (F / 0.75) = 39 Let's solve for F: F - 0.75F - 0.10F = 39 * 0.75 0.25F - 0.10F = 29.25 0.15F = 29.25 F = 29.25 / 0.15 F = 195 Now that we have the number of pure Fuji trees (F), we can find the number of cross-pollinated trees (C) using relationship 1: C = 0.10 * T C = 0.10 * (F / 0.75) C = 0.10 * (195 / 0.75) C = 0.10 * 260 C = 26 Finally, we can find the total number of pure Fuji and cross-pollinated trees (X): X = F + C X = 195 + 26 X = 221 Therefore, the total number of pure Fuji and cross-pollinated trees is boxed{221} ."},{"instruction":"The line that passes through the focus of the parabola y^{2}=4x and is perpendicular to the xaxis intersects the asymptotes of the hyperbola x^{2}frac{y^{2}}{3}=1 at points A and B.

We aim to minimize ( k ). 1. **Choosing ( s ):**    - Since ( s^7 ) must divide ( k ), we start by choosing the smallest possible value for ( s ). The smallest positive integer is ( s = 2 ).    - If ( s geq 3 ), then ( k geq 3^7 = 2187 ), which is greater than 1024. Therefore, ( s = 2 ). 2. **Choosing ( r ):**    - Next, we need ( r^5 ) to divide ( k ). Since ( s = 2 ), ( r ) must be distinct from 2. The smallest integer greater than 2 is 3, but we need to check if using a power of 2 is more efficient.    - If ( r ) is not a power of 2, there exists another prime factor ( d geq 3 ) which divides ( r ). This would make ( k geq 2^7 cdot d^5 geq 2^7 cdot 3^5 = 31104 ), which is much larger than 1024.    - Therefore, we take ( r ) to be the smallest power of 2 available, i.e., ( r = 2^2 = 4 ). 3. **Choosing ( q ):**    - Now, we need ( q^3 ) to divide ( k ). Since ( q ) must be distinct from 2 and 4, the next smallest power of 2 is ( q = 2^3 = 8 ). 4. **Choosing ( p ):**    - We need ( p^2 ) to divide ( k ). Since ( p ) must be distinct from 2, 4, and 8, the next smallest power of 2 is ( p = 2^4 = 16 ). 5. **Choosing ( t ):**    - Finally, we need ( t^{11} ) to divide ( k ). Since ( t ) must be distinct from 2, 4, 8, and 16, the next smallest power of 2 is ( t = 2^5 = 32 ). However, we notice that using ( t = 1 ) (the smallest positive integer) simplifies the problem and still satisfies the conditions. Therefore, we choose ( t = 1 ). 6. **Calculating ( k ):**    - Now, we calculate ( k ) as the product of these terms:    [    k = p^2 cdot q^3 cdot r^5 cdot s^7 cdot t^{11} = 16^2 cdot 8^3 cdot 4^5 cdot 2^7 cdot 1^{11}    ]    - Simplifying each term:    [    16^2 = 256, quad 8^3 = 512, quad 4^5 = 1024, quad 2^7 = 128, quad 1^{11} = 1    ]    - Therefore:    [    k = 256 cdot 512 cdot 1024 cdot 128 cdot 1    ] However, this calculation seems incorrect.

There are two key aspects to consider: the sign of the coefficient left(m^{2}-m-1right) and the power -5m-3. 1. **Condition on the Coefficient for Decreasing Function**:    The function is decreasing if the coefficient left(m^{2}-m-1right) is positive, because the power of x is negative. Therefore, we require:    m^{2}-m-1 > 0.    However, the solution provided mistakenly states this condition as an equality, m^{2}-m-1=1. This is incorrect for determining the sign. For a decreasing function, we do not set this polynomial equal to 1 but rather look for it to be positive. This error in the provided solution affects the subsequent analysis. 2. **Condition on the Exponent**:    Since the exponent is -5m-3, for x^{-5m-3} to result in a decreasing function on (0,+infty), we require the exponent to be negative, that is:    -5m-3 < 0.    Solving this inequality gives:    -5m < 3,    m > -dfrac{3}{5}. Given the inaccuracies in the provided solution regarding the condition for the coefficient, we correct the approach as follows: - Correctly analyzing the coefficient left(m^{2}-m-1right) for positivity would involve solving the inequality m^{2}-m-1 > 0, which is not directly addressed in the provided solution. - The solution directly jumps to stating m=2, which seems to be an oversight or a simplification error. Therefore, the correct step-wise approach should have been: 1. **Correctly Establish Conditions for Decreasing Function**:    - For the coefficient: Determine the values of m for which m^{2}-m-1 > 0.    - For the exponent: Solve -5m-3 < 0 to find m > -dfrac{3}{5}. 2. **Solve the Conditions**:    - The exponent condition correctly simplifies to m > -dfrac{3}{5}. 3. **Identify the Error and Provide Correct Answer**:    Given the incorrect setup for the coefficient's condition, we cannot directly conclude m=2 based on the provided solution. The correct process involves solving the inequality and exponent condition accurately to determine the values of m that make the function decreasing. Without the correct analysis and solving of the inequality m^{2}-m-1 > 0, we cannot accurately reach the conclusion given in the provided solution.

A regular decagon has 10 sides. The formula to find the number of diagonals (D) in a polygon with n sides is: D = n(n - 3) / 2 For a decagon (n = 10): D = 10(10 - 3) / 2 D = 10(7) / 2 D = 70 / 2 D = 35 So, there are 35 diagonals in a regular decagon. Now, let's find the number of shortest diagonals. The shortest diagonals in a regular decagon are those that connect two non-adjacent vertices that are three vertices apart. To visualize this, if you label the vertices of the decagon from 1 to 10 in a clockwise direction, the shortest diagonals would connect vertices 1 to 4, 2 to 5, 3 to 6, and so on. Since the decagon is regular (all sides and angles are equal), there will be the same number of shortest diagonals as there are vertices, because each vertex will be the starting point for exactly one of the shortest diagonals. Therefore, the number of shortest diagonals (S) is equal to the number of vertices (n): S = n S = 10 Now we can calculate the probability (P) of selecting one of the shortest diagonals: P = S / D P = 10 / 35 P = 2 / 7 So, the probability of randomly selecting one of the shortest diagonals from all the diagonals of a regular decagon is boxed{2/7} ."},{"instruction":"order to obtain an income of Rs. 450 from a certain percentage stock at Rs. 108, one must make an investment of Rs. 4860.

Simplifying, we get:    [    p(p - c) = frac{(a + b + c)(a + b - c)}{4}    ] 8. Using the difference of squares, we have:    [    (a + b + c)(a + b - c) = (a + b)^2 - c^2    ] 9. Since ( c^2 = a^2 + b^2 ), we get:    [    (a + b)^2 - c^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2 - (a^2 + b^2) = 2ab    ] 10. Therefore,     [     p(p - c) = frac{2ab}{4} = frac{ab}{2} = S     ] Next, let's show that ( (p - a)(p - b) = S ): 11.

Therefore,     [     (p - a)(p - b) = left( frac{b + c - a}{2} right) left( frac{a + c - b}{2} right)     ] 13. Simplifying, we get:     [     (p - a)(p - b) = frac{(b + c - a)(a + c - b)}{4}     ] 14. Using the difference of squares, we have:     [     (b + c - a)(a + c - b) = (c + (b - a))(c - (b - a)) = c^2 - (b - a)^2     ] 15. Since ( c^2 = a^2 + b^2 ), we get:     [     c^2 - (b - a)^2 = a^2 + b^2 - (b^2 - 2ab + a^2) = 2ab     ] 16. Therefore,     [     (p - a)(p - b) = frac{2ab}{4} = frac{ab}{2} = S     ] Thus, we have shown that ( p(p - c) = (p - a)(p - b) = S ).

When swimming against the current, we subtract the speed of the current from the man's swimming speed to find his effective speed. Effective speed against the current = Swimming speed in still water - Speed of water Effective speed against the current = 20 km/h - 12 km/h Effective speed against the current = 8 km/h Now that we have the effective speed, we can calculate the distance he swam using the formula: Distance = Speed × Time We know the time taken is 5 hours, so: Distance = Effective speed against the current × Time Distance = 8 km/h × 5 hours Distance = 40 km Therefore, the man swam boxed{40}  kilometers against the current."},{"instruction":"A systematic sampling method is used to select 32 individuals from a group of 960 for a questionnaire survey.

This implies that a polynomial constructed with k leq 2016 may not be unique, thus k > 2016. 5. **Sufficiency of (k = 2017):**    Now, we show that if the teacher chooses (k = 2017) appropriate values for n_i, the polynomial can be uniquely determined.     6. **Use of Lemma:**    Consider the lemma: \\"If P(x) is a polynomial with integer coefficients and (a) and (b) are distinct integers, then P(a) - P(b) is divisible by (a - b).\\" This can be shown by expanding P(x) as:    [    P(x) = p_n x^n + p_{n-1}x^{n-1} + cdots + p_1 x + p_0,    ]    and noting that    [    P(a) - P(b) = p_n(a^n - b^n) + p_{n-1}(a^{n-1} - b^{n-1}) + cdots + p_1(a - b),    ]    where each term is divisible by a - b. 7. **Example Construction:**    Let's set (k = 2017) and (n_i = 4i) for (i = 1, 2, ldots, 2017). Suppose the teacher announces:    [    P(n_1) P(n_2) cdots P(n_{2017}) = 1.    ]    Consider the polynomial:    [    P(x) = (x - n_1)(x - n_2) cdots (x - n_{2017}) + 1.    ]    This construction ensures that P(n_i) = 1 for all (i), meeting the required conditions. 8. **Uniqueness Argument:**    Suppose another polynomial (Q(x)) meets the same conditions, i.e. (Q(n_1) Q(n_2) cdots Q(n_{2017}) = 1). Given integer coefficients and the constraint (Q(n_i) = pm 1) for all (i), distinct values (Q(n_i) = 1) and (Q(n_j) = -1) would result in:    [    Q(n_i) - Q(n_j) = 2,    ]    which is not divisible by (n_i - n_j) (a contradiction). Thus, all (Q(n_i)) must equal 1. Hence, both (P(x)) and (Q(x)) share the same k roots. 9. **Conclusion:**    The smallest (k) such that the teacher can achieve the goal is:    [    boxed{2017}    ]"},{"instruction":"What is the greatest common factor of 180, 240, and 300?","output":"First, we will find the prime factorizations of each number: - The prime factorization of 180 is 2^2 times 3^2 times 5. - The prime factorization of 240 is 2^4 times 3 times 5. - The prime factorization of 300 is 2^2 times 3 times 5^2.

Step 1: Recognize the given relationship. [a=2bcos C] Step 2: Relate the given equation to the Law of Sines.   The Law of Sines in a general form for a triangle triangle ABC is: [frac{a}{sin A} = frac{b}{sin B} = frac{c}{sin C}] Given a=2bcos C, we can interpret this in terms of the Law of Cosines or trigonometric identities. However, the solution suggests a manipulation that leads to an equation involving sin A and sin B. This manipulation suggests considering trigonometric identities directly, leading to an equation involving sin A, sin B, and cos C. Step 3: Derive the implied trigonometric relationship. Given the relationship and the sum of angles in a triangle A + B + C = pi, we look at the sine of the sum of two angles: [sin(A+B) = sin(pi - C) = sin C] By trigonometric identity, sin(A + B) = sin A cos B + cos A sin B. Since A + B + C = pi, we know A + B = pi - C, and thus sin(pi - C) = sin C. This leads us to consider the relationship between the angles, rather than directly invoking the Law of Sines. Step 4: Analyze the equality and its implications. Given that a=2bcos C, and interpreting this within the context of trigonometric relationships, we consider the equality: [sin B cos C + cos B sin C = 2sin B cos C] This simplifies to: [sin(B - C) = 0] Step 5: Determine the relationship between B and C. From sin(B - C) = 0, it follows that B - C = kpi, where k in mathbb{Z}. However, considering the angles are part of a triangle and their values are within (0, pi), the feasible solution is B = C. Step 6: Conclude the shape of the triangle. Since B = C, triangle triangle ABC must be an isosceles triangle, where two of its angles are equal.

(ltf0501).","output":"1. **Lemma Proof:**    We start by proving the lemma that states: In triangle ABC with incenter I, let BI intersect AC at E and CI intersect AB at F. Let M be the midpoint of BC. Then the A-symmedian, EF, and IM are concurrent.    To prove this, we use barycentric coordinates. Let the coordinates of A, B, and C be (1,0,0), (0,1,0), and (0,0,1) respectively. The incenter I has coordinates (a:b:c). The coordinates of E and F can be determined as follows:    - E lies on BI and AC, so its coordinates are (0:b:c).    - F lies on CI and AB, so its coordinates are (a:0:c).    The midpoint M of BC has coordinates (0:1:1).    Now, let X be the point of intersection of the A-symmedian and IM. Assume X has coordinates (x:y:z). Since X lies on the A-symmedian, we have y:z = b^2:c^2, implying z = frac{c^2y}{b^2}.    Since X also lies on IM, we have:    [    0 = begin{vmatrix}    x & y & z     a & b & c     0 & 1 & 1    end{vmatrix} = x(b-c) - ya + frac{ac^2y}{b^2}    ]    Simplifying, we get:    [    x(b-c) = y left(a - frac{ac^2}{b^2}right) implies x:y = frac{a(b^2-c^2)}{b^2(b-c)} = frac{a(b+c)}{b^2}    ]    Thus, the coordinates of X are (ab+ac:b^2:c^2).    To prove X, E, and F are collinear, we need the determinant to be zero:    [    begin{vmatrix}    a & 0 & c     a & b & 0     ab+ac & b^2 & c^2    end{vmatrix} = abc^2 + c(ab^2 - ab^2 - abc) = 0    ]    Hence, X, E, and F are collinear. 2. **Main Problem:**    Given the lemma, we know that AQ is the A-symmedian of Delta ABC. Let AP and AQ intersect odot(ABC) at T and V respectively, and let EF intersect odot(ABC) at X and Y. Let VT intersect BC at K.     Since -1 = (A, V; B, C) overset{T}{=} (overline{AT} cap overline{BC}, K; B, C), it follows that K in overline{XY}. Thus, (B, C), (X, Y), and (T, V) are pairs of an involution Phi. Projecting Phi from A onto overline{EF}, we get that (X, Y), (E, F), and (P, Q) are pairs of an involution. Hence, odot(ABC), odot(AEF), and odot(APQ) are coaxial.

This is a fundamental property of linear functions with a positive slope. Since -3 < 4, and we have established that as x increases, y also increases, it follows that y_1 < y_2.

If Winnie takes 4 cones, then 2012 - 4 = 2008 cones remain.    - Next move is for Eeyore. Regardless of whether he takes 1 or 3 cones, the total number of cones left after his move will still be an odd number:      - If Eeyore takes 1 cone: 2008 - 1 = 2007 cones left.      - If Eeyore takes 3 cones: 2008 - 3 = 2005 cones left.    - Observe that after Eeyore's turn, we are left with an odd number of cones. 3. **Continue the Strategy:**    - Winnie-the-Pooh should always take 1 cone after Eeyore’s move. This ensures that the number of cones remains even after his move:      - If Eeyore had taken 1 cone (leaving an odd number), Winnie then takes 1: (odd - 1) → even.      - If Eeyore had taken 3 cones (leaving an odd number), Winnie then takes 1: (odd - 1) → even. 4. **Conclusion of the Strategy:**    - By always taking 1 cone after Eeyore's move, Winnie ensures that only even numbers of cones remain after his turn.    - Eventually, this will force Eeyore into a position where he faces 1 remaining cone on his turn. At this point:      - Eeyore takes 1 cone, leaving 0 cones for the next player (Winnie-the-Pooh), leading Eeyore to win if Winnie can take another move.    - To ensure Winnie's success, he must adapt his move by taking 4 cones to initially get control over the odd condition by future moves.

Substitute 2a_1=16-7d into the second equation, we get (16-3d)(16+3d)=220. This simplifies to 256-9d^2=220, and thus d^2=4. Since d > 0, we have d=2.

This creates two right triangles, triangle MNH and triangle MNC. 4. **Similarity of Triangles**: Observe that triangle ACH is a right triangle because overline{AH} is an altitude. Since overline{MN} perp overline{HC}, triangle MNH and triangle MNC are also right triangles. By AA similarity criterion (two angles are equal), triangle ACH sim triangle MNC because angle ACH = angle MNC = 90^circ and angle HAC = angle NMC (both are complementary to angle ACM in their respective triangles). 5. **Congruence of Triangles**: From the similarity of triangle ACH and triangle MNC, we have overline{HN} = overline{NC} because corresponding sides in similar triangles are proportional and overline{AM} = overline{MC}. Therefore, triangle MNH cong triangle MNC by HL (Hypotenuse-Leg) congruence criterion, as overline{MN} is a common hypotenuse and overline{HN} = overline{NC}. 6. **Finding angle MHC**: Since triangle MNH cong triangle MNC, corresponding angles are equal, so angle MHC = angle MCH. But angle MCH is half of angle ACB because overline{BM} is a median and thus bisects angle B. Since angle ACB = 30^circ, angle MCH = frac{1}{2} times 30^circ = 15^circ. However, this contradicts the congruence derived, which implies angle MHC = angle MCH = 30^circ. 7. **Conclusion**: The correct calculation should recognize that angle MHC = angle MCH = 30^circ due to the congruence of triangles triangle MNH and triangle MNC, and not half of angle ACB. Therefore, the answer is boxed{30^circ}. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"Determine the pairs of sets  X,Ysubsetmathbb{R}  for which the following is true: if  f(x, y)  is a function on  Xtimes Y{}  such that for every  xin X  it is equal to a polynomial in  y  on  Y  and for every  yin Y  it is equal to a polynomial in  x  on  X  then  f  is a bivariate polynomial on  Xtimes Y.","output":"1. **Case 1: One of the sets (A) or (B) is finite**    Suppose without loss of generality that (A = {a_1, a_2, ldots, a_s}) with the (a_i) distinct.

Since the diagonals divide the quadrilateral into triangles of equal area, we have:    [    text{Area of}  triangle ABD = text{Area of}  triangle BCD    ]    Since they share the common base (BD), and their heights from the vertices (A) and (C) to this base must be equal.

Suppose we have a cyclic quadrilateral ABCD inscribed in a circle, where the products of the lengths of opposite sides are equal, i.e., (AB cdot CD = AD cdot BC).    2. We need to prove that the tangents to the circle at points opposite on the quadrilateral intersect on the diagonals or are parallel to them. 3. Let's assume tangents at points A and C intersect the diagonal DB at points M and M_0 respectively. 4. According to our hypothesis, the ratios of the squares of lengths divided by the squares of their respective segments should be equal:    [    frac{d^2}{a^2} = frac{DM}{MB} quad text{and} quad frac{c^2}{b^2} = frac{DM_0}{M_0 B}    ]    Since    [    frac{d^2}{a^2} = frac{c^2}{b^2}    ]    it follows directly that     [    frac{DM}{MB} = frac{DM_0}{M_0 B}    ] 5. Consequently, the points M and M_0 must coincide. 6. This implies that the tangents at points A and C intersect at the same point on diagonal DB. 7. By a similar argument, it can be shown that tangents at B and D also intersect on the diagonal AC. 8. Since tangents must intersect at the same points on the diagonals due to symmetry and equality, it follows that the tangents are symmetric about the diagonals and either intersect directly upon or are parallel to the diagonals. Conclusion: Therefore, we have shown that the tangents to the circle at opposite vertices of the quadrilateral either intersect on the diagonals or are parallel to them. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"The sum of the interior angles of a polygon is equal to twice the sum of its exterior angles.

For simplicity, let’s place the start of the first segment at the origin, meaning both its endpoints have integer coordinates. 3. **Analysis of segment intersections**:    - Consider the second segment. This second segment must intersect the first segment, but cannot entirely contain nor be entirely contained within the first segment. Otherwise, the intersection would have an even length (since containing or being contained would mean endpoints will share parity).    - Consequently, one of the endpoints of the second segment must have an integer coordinate. Since the second segment itself is of even length, the other endpoint must also be an integer. 4. **Generalizing the segment properties**:    - By similar logic, the third segment must also intersect both the first and the second segments without entirely containing or being contained within either.    - Thus, both endpoints of the third segment must similarly have integer coordinates owing to it being of even length. 5. **Analyzing coordinates**:    - Given the condition about intersections being segments of odd length, we need to investigate the coordinate parities.    - The endpoints of any two segments will have identical parity since all segments are of even length (either both even or both odd).    - When segments have endpoints of identical parity, their intersection would necessarily subdivide into segments possessing equivalent endpoint parity, thus creating a segment of even length. 6. **Contradiction**:    - We observe a contradiction here because, according to the problem's requirements, the intersections must result in segments having odd lengths, which is impossible if all individual segment endpoints have identical parity leading to even intersection lengths.

Since there are two hydrogen atoms in CaH2, the molecular weight of CaH2 is: Molecular weight of CaH2 = (1 x atomic weight of Ca) + (2 x atomic weight of H) Molecular weight of CaH2 = (1 x 40.08 g/mol) + (2 x 1.008 g/mol) Molecular weight of CaH2 = 40.08 g/mol + 2.016 g/mol Molecular weight of CaH2 = 42.096 g/mol Now, if the molecular weight of 10 moles of CaH2 is 420, we can calculate the molecular weight of one mole of CaH2: 420 g / 10 moles = 42 g/mol This is consistent with the calculated molecular weight of CaH2 above (42.096 g/mol, rounded to 42 g/mol).

Identify the trigonometric function on Sofia's card and compute the value for angle y given she is the only one able to deduce her function entirely.","output":"Since Sofia was the only one able to determine her function, we need a distinct trait of her card relative to the others: - When tan y distinctly differs in relational ordering from sin y and cos y, it suggests that tan y is extremely large or undefined as y approaches 90^circ. Also, it notably distinguishes its range from sin y and cos y when y approaches 45^circ and beyond since tan y starts to exceed both as y increases. Looking at trigonometric properties: - As y increases from 0^circ to 90^circ, sin y increases from 0 to 1. - cos y decreases from 1 to 0. - tan y increases from 0 to infty. The unique situation occurs when tan y is significantly larger than both sin y and cos y, which typically happens as y increases past 45^circ towards 90^circ. Here tan y can become the largest among the three beyond a critical point before approaching 90^circ.    Therefore, for Sofia to determine her function: - If tan y > sin y and tan y > cos y, Sofia has the tan y card.

The players take turns to take between 1 and 7 matches from a pile of 2014 matches, and the player who takes the last match wins. We aim to determine who wins with a correct strategy. 1. Let's analyze the problem step by step:     - The total number of matches is 2014.     - The player who takes the last match wins.     - Each player can take between 1 and 7 matches per turn. 2. Key observation: If a player leaves a multiple of 8 matches for the opponent, then that player can always force a win. This is because no matter how many matches the opponent takes (between 1 and 7), the player can always take enough matches (between 1 and 7) to again leave a multiple of 8 for the opponent in the next round. 3. Explore the specific case for the initial condition:     - The total matches initially are 2014. 4. Determine the optimal first move:     - The player needs to determine how many matches to take first to ensure a multiple of 8 (i.e., leave a number of matches that constrains the opponent and allows the first player to control the rest of the game). 5. Calculation:     - Calculate (2014 mod 8):     [     2014 div 8 = 251 quad text{with a remainder of} quad 2014 - (251 times 8) = 2014 - 2008 = 6     ]     - This means that if the starting player takes 6 matches, 2008 matches will be left.     - 2008 is a multiple of 8 ( (2008 = 8 times 251)).    6. Subsequent Strategy:     - After taking 6 matches leaving 2008 matches, the starting player will always take as many matches as necessary to leave a multiple of 8 matches after every turn.     - Example scenario:         - If the second player takes ( k ) matches, where ( 1 leq k leq 7 ), the starting player can take ( 8 - k ) matches in response, ensuring that after every turn, the total number of matches remaining is still a multiple of 8 when it is the opponent's turn.

From the information given, we have the following relationships: 1. Jared counted 15% fewer cars than Ann, so J = A - 0.15A = 0.85A. 2. Ann counted 7 more cars than Alfred, so A = F + 7. 3. The total number of cars counted by all three is 983, so J + A + F = 983. We can substitute the value of J from the first relationship into the third equation: 0.85A + A + F = 983 Combining the A terms, we get: 1.85A + F = 983 Now, we can substitute the value of A from the second relationship into the above equation: 1.85(F + 7) + F = 983 Expanding the equation, we get: 1.85F + 12.95 + F = 983 Combining the F terms, we get: 2.85F + 12.95 = 983 Subtracting 12.95 from both sides, we get: 2.85F = 983 - 12.95 2.85F = 970.05 Now, we can solve for F: F = 970.05 / 2.85 F = 340.3684210526316 Since the number of cars counted must be a whole number, we can round F to the nearest whole number, which is 340.
