A baby is crawling happily. A baby sneezed and scared another baby. On a scale from 0 to 5, where 0 is \\"no meaning overlap\\" and 5 is \\"means the same thing\\", how closely does the first sentence resemble the second one?","output":"On the provided scale, I would rate the sentence similarity as 1.  While both sentences center on babies and describe some sort of activity, their meaning and context widely differ.  The first sentence, 'A baby is crawling happily', is about individual baby behavior. It portrays a specific activity - crawling - associated with a positive, joyful emotion (indicated by 'happily'). The language is neutral, and the scene being set is tranquil and pleasant. The narrative focuses on the baby's movement and positive temperament, which are essential aspects of a baby's development and daily routine. Overall, it brings up images of a baby exploring their surroundings, exhibiting the natural curiosity children of that age often portray. The second sentence, 'A baby sneezed and scared another baby', is about an interaction between two babies. It comprises two events - one baby sneezing (which is spontaneous and uncontrolled) and the resulting surprise or fear of another baby. This sentence, while still involving a baby's actions, introduces another layer to the baby's interactions - influencing another baby's emotional state presumably unintentionally. The elements of sneezing and fear are not present in the first sentence at all. As such, the two sentences' meaning, context, and emotional undertone really do not overlap much. The only honest similarity is that both sentences are centered on babies, but they describe different actions and reactions, creating disparate scenarios and invoking different emotional responses. Therefore, while not completely disparate (which would be a 0 rating), they are not similar enough to score higher on this scale."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. What is the answer to this question? what is the meaning of apres moi le deluge?","output":"\\"Apres moi, le deluge\\" is a French phrase that translates to \\"After me, the deluge\\" or \\"After my reign, the flood\\" in English. It is often attributed to King Louis XV or his mistress, Madame de Pompadour, though its origin is still debatable. To understand the meaning of this phrase, we need to delve into its historical context, its usage in literature and popular culture, and the symbolic meaning behind it. 1. Historical Context:  King Louis XV ruled France from 1715 to 1774. His reign was marked by financial mismanagement, an ever-increasing tax burden on the common people, and France's involvement in several costly wars. The general populace was dissatisfied with his administration, and this sentiment eventually contributed to the French Revolution in 1789, which overthrew the monarchy. The phrase \\"Apres moi, le deluge\\" is said to have originated during or shortly after the Seven Years' War (1756-1763). At the end of the war, France was financially drained, and the situation only worsened subsequently. The saying is thought to convey a sense of foreboding or impending doom, suggesting that, once Louis XV's reign ended, chaos, disorder, and destruction would follow - which, as history reveals, was the case during the French Revolution and the subsequent Reign of Terror. 2. Usage in Literature and Popular Culture: The phrase has been used in multiple literary works and other cultural forms to signify a sense of recklessness, selfishness, or lack of forethought. The idea behind it is that the person using the phrase is knowingly causing damage or harm, without caring about the consequences for those who will succeed them. One example is the usage of \\"Apres moi, le deluge\\" in Leo Tolstoy's novel, \\"War and Peace,\\" where the character General Kutuzov reflects on his wartime actions and their impact on future generations. Similarly, contemporary authors and playwrights have used the phrase to symbolize a point where people refuse to take responsibility for their actions, predicting catastrophic outcomes from short-sighted decisions. 3. Symbolic Meaning: On a symbolic level, \\"Apres moi, le deluge\\" can also be interpreted as a warning or a message of accountability. It reminds those in positions of authority or responsibility that their decisions have enduring consequences, and if they fail to consider the long-term impact of their actions, their successors and society at large may suffer adverse effects. The phrase can also be applied to modern issues and situations, such as environmental degradation, unsustainable economic policies, and political decisions that have far-reaching repercussions. It serves as a reminder of the need for responsible leadership and the importance of making decisions that benefit not just the individual, but society as a whole. In conclusion, \\"Apres moi, le deluge\\" is a phrase with historical roots in the reign of King Louis XV of France. It encapsulates a prophecy of societal collapse in the case of poor and careless governance, and later came to symbolize the responsibility that people, especially leaders, have to consider the long-term consequences of their actions. As a saying, it remains relevant today, reminding us of the importance of conscientious decision-making and sustainable living."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The Roman camp was destroyed by fire and rebuilt six times between the first and the fifth centuries AD: in 70, 97, 235, 355, in the last quarter of the fourth century, and in the early years of the fifth century. It was under Trajan and after the fire of 97 that Argentoratum received its most extended and fortified shape. From the year 90 on, the Legio VIII Augusta was permanently stationed in the Roman camp of Argentoratum. It then included a cavalry section and covered an area of approximately 20 hectares.

Solve this math problem Solve -39 - 96 = -35*q + 8*q for q.","output":"First, I'll start by simplifying the right-hand side of the equation: -35*q + 8*q. This simplifies to: -27*q.  So, the equation becomes -39 - 96 = -27*q. Next, combine the numbers on the left-hand side of the equation: -39 - 96. This equals: -135. So the equation becomes -135 = -27*q. After that, to solve for the variable 'q', divide both sides of the equation by -27: q = -135 / -27 After carrying out the division, I get: q = 5 Justifying the steps: 1. I first simplified the right-hand side of the equation by combining like terms, which in this case was -35*q and 8*q. 2. Then, the next step is to combine the numerical values on the left-hand side of the equation: -39 and -96. 3. Now, we get -135 on the left side and -27*q on the right side of the equation. 4.

What I was saying is, a culture that thinks that comic books and comic book movies are profound meditations on the human condition is a dumb (explicit) culture. And for people to get mad at that just proves my point.\\"      The new interview comes days after Maher wrote a blog post on his website over the weekend that many people called disrespectful to Lee, who died Nov. 12 at the age of 95.      \\"America is in mourning. Deep, deep mourning for a man who inspired millions to, I don’t know, watch a movie, I guess,\\" Maher wrote about the cultural icon responsible for many of Marvel’s most popular superheroes in comic books and movies. Lee's team at POW! Entertainment quickly fired back at the late-night host, calling his words about man \\"frankly disgusting.\\"      In an open letter, Lee's team said, \\"Countless people can attest to how Stan inspired them to read, taught them that the world is not made up of absolutes, that heroes can have flaws and even villains can show humanity within their souls.\\"      Maher's post continued, saying he has nothing \\"against comic books,\\" but that when he was growing up \\"comics were for kids, and when you grew up you moved on to big-boy books without the pictures.      \\"But then twenty years or so ago, something happened – adults decided they didn’t have to give up kid stuff,\\" he said. \\"And so they pretended comic books were actually sophisticated literature.\\"      Then the late-night host brought politics into the mix, mentioning President Donald Trump.      \\"I don’t think it’s a huge stretch to suggest that Donald Trump could only get elected in a country that thinks comic books are important,\\" Maher wrote.      The open letter from POW! Entertainment concluded: \\"Our shock at your comments makes us want to say ‘ ’Nuff said, Bill,' but instead we will rely on another of Stan’s lessons to remind you that you have a powerful platform, so please remember: 'With great power there must also come – great responsibility!' ”      After Maher's post went online, Lee's fans jumped on social media to slam him.

The equation now becomes -307*t + 201 = -1027. Step 2: Isolate the term with the variable (t) We want to solve for t, so we'll isolate the term containing t by moving the constant term to the other side of the equation.  To do this, subtract 201 from both sides of the equation: -307*t + 201 - 201 = -1027 - 201. This simplifies to -307*t = -1228. Step 3: Solve for t Now, divide both sides of the equation by -307 to solve for t: (-307*t) / -307 = -1228 / -307. This simplifies to t = 4.

Context: The bright Sunday morning sun illuminated the stained glass windows, diffusing multi-colored hues across the congregation. Attendance is up today, thought Greg. As the organist was nearing the end of the Prelude, he stepped up to the podium. \\"Please take your hymnals and turn to page 23, and let's stand and sing 'Holy, Holy, Holy.'\\" Holy, holy, holy! Lord God Almighty! Early in the morning, our song shall rise to Thee... As Greg sang and conducted the 4/4 pattern, which he could do in his sleep, his mind began to wander. Shouldn't he feel guilty about what he was thinking last night while kissing Cynthia on the couch? His actions had been within the bounds of acceptable behavior. He had nothing to be ashamed of in that regard. But what about his thoughts? It wasn't what he did with Cynthia--it was what he wanted to do. He didn't want to dishonor her or his commitment to God. But his feelings had been only natural. God created humans and gave them sexual desire. Wasn't it okay to want to have sex, as long as you didn't actually do it? Then he remembered the passage from Matthew 5:28. But I say to you, that whosoever shall look on a woman to lust after her, hath already committed adultery with her in his heart. At the end of the hymn, Greg stepped back and Dr. Huff went to the podium and said a prayer. Then there were announcements, two more hymns, and a chorus. After the offering, it was time for the choir to sing their anthem. When Greg motioned to the choir to stand, Cynthia smiled at him from the Alto section. She was so incredibly beautiful. Standing there in her choir robe, she looked like a redheaded angel. If they could just get married, Greg could stop feeling guilty about his desire for her. Question: Who stepped up to the podium? Options: - Cynthia. - not enough information - God. - Greg. The answer to this question is:","output":"- Greg.

See options at the end She bought a notebook computer instead of laptop for her university lectures, because the  Available choices:  -notebook computer is more portable.;  -laptop is more portable.;","output":"She bought a notebook computer instead of a laptop for her university lectures because the notebook computer is more portable. Both laptops and notebook computers have extensive applications in the academic world. They offer exceptional convenience for university students who need a portable, user-friendly solution for taking notes, conducting research, and accessing online resources in lectures and study sessions. However, the decision to choose a notebook computer over a laptop for her studies reveals a preference for the increased portability that comes with the former. Notebook computers, commonly known as ultrabooks, are generally lighter and more compact than traditional laptops, making them an ideal choice for those who frequently travel from one lecture hall to another. Students who carry their devices daily will appreciate the reduced strain on their shoulders and the increased ease of fitting a notebook computer into their bags. Additionally, notebook computers are designed to be slim and lightweight without sacrificing performance or feature availability. The sleek, minimalistic design of notebook computers is achieved through a variety of innovations that reduce bulkiness. For example, they often incorporate cutting-edge, ultra-low-voltage processors that conserve power while maintaining impressive performance levels. This efficiency enables the use of smaller, lighter batteries and contributes to an overall reduction in weight. Similarly, manufacturers optimize the chassis and internal hardware layouts to maximize space utilization and eliminate excess material. Despite their compact size, notebook computers do not lack functionality. They typically offer all the essential features university students require, such as sufficient processing power, adequate storage capacity, and high-quality displays. Most notebook computers today have solid-state drives (SSD) rather than traditional hard disk drives (HDD), which not only ensures faster data access and reduced power consumption but also minimizes the chances of data loss due to physical damage.  Moreover, notebook computers boast remarkable battery life, often providing students with all-day use on a single charge. This is particularly important for those attending multiple, back-to-back lectures or engaging in group projects, as it eliminates the burden of constantly searching for power outlets to recharge during breaks. Although the degree of portability may not be imperative for all students, it can make a significant difference for those who commute to campus, navigate large university grounds, or wish to work on their devices outside the lecture halls. Ultimately, the decision to choose a notebook computer over a laptop for her university lectures demonstrates the practicality of adopting a more portable solution for the demands of a busy academic life."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. IBM opened a sprawling and sophisticated semiconductor factory here on Wednesday that cost more than 2.5 billion to build and equip, the largest single capital investment the company has ever made. The factory, which opens as the computer chip business is in a slump, is a costly and risky move for IBM. But it is also an expression of confidence by the company that it can remain a technology leader in the highly competitive global semiconductor industry, and a commitment that the best place to execute that strategy is in upstate New York. IBM is an exception among computer makers in that it still invests heavily in research to advance the design, manufacture and materials used in semiconductor chips. It is spending more than 500 million a year on semiconductor research and development. The factory will produce a wide range of specialized semiconductors used in everything from the largest mainframe computers to cell phones and video-game consoles. The new plant is part of IBM's push to gain a strong lead in chip-making beyond the personal computer business, where Intel and East Asian chip producers hold the advantage. \\"The core of our strategy is to lead in technology and attack the high-performance segments of the market,\\" said John Kelly, senior vice president in charge of IBM's technology group. An advantage to having the semiconductor fabricating factory here, Kelly explained, was that it was very close to its research laboratories in nearby Westchester County, N.Y. To stay ahead in advanced chip technology, he said, moving innovations out of the labs and into the factory as fast as possible is crucial. \\"What we call the lab-to-fab time should be as close to zero as possible,\\" Kelly said. \\"If our strategy were anything but to be on the leading edge, we'd have put the plant in Asia.\\" The new factory, which will begin normal production early next year, will employ about 1,000 people.  Do you have any questions?","output":"The opening of IBM's new semiconductor factory in upstate New York, at a cost of over 2.5 billion, is a bold move by the company, especially given the current slowdown in the computer chip industry. This investment reflects IBM's confidence in its ability to remain a technology leader in the highly competitive global semiconductor market and demonstrates their commitment to advancing research, design, and manufacturing in the field. The decision to locate the factory in New York, close to research facilities, underscores the importance of quickly integrating lab innovations into the production process. With IBM investing more than 500 million annually on semiconductor research and development, the company is looking to expand its reach beyond the realm of personal computer chips, where Intel and East Asian competitors have traditionally held an advantage. By focusing on producing specialized semiconductors for a range of applications, from mainframe computers to cell phones and video game consoles, IBM aims to target high-performance market segments. The factory's close proximity to its research laboratories in Westchester County, New York, will enable faster lab-to-fab integration, which, according to John Kelly, Senior Vice President in charge of IBM's technology group, is critical in maintaining a leading-edge approach to advanced chip technology. This strategic move is what led to the decision to build the factory in upstate New York rather than in Asia. With normal production expected to start early next year, the factory will provide employment opportunities for approximately 1,000 people. In summary, IBM's new semiconductor factory represents a significant investment in both advanced technology and the local economy. This move highlights the company's commitment to staying ahead in the constantly evolving and competitive global semiconductor industry, with particular emphasis on rapid integration of research advancements into their manufacturing processes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Sunlight Answer:","output":"Title: The Celestial Fireworks Plot: In the year 2050, Earth has advanced its space technology to explore the depths of the universe. The International Space Agency (ISA) has discovered an extraordinary cosmic event— a comet nicknamed \\"Atlas\\", that only comes close to the Sun and Earth once every 1000 years, exhibiting mesmerizing out-gassing explosions when sunlight hits its surface. As the comet's approach nears, Dr. Evelyn Grant, a leading astrophysicist, notices anomalies in Atlas's trajectory and behavior. She shares her concerns with ISA's director, but her warnings are dismissed, maintaining that the comet will safely bypass Earth as predicted by scientists. Simultaneously, an alien vessel hiding behind the moon for centuries sends cryptic messages deciphered by Evelyn, revealing a prophecy of celestial fireworks that may threaten the existence of Earth itself. Determined to prove her theory, Evelyn secretly assembles a team of astronauts, including Capt. Mike Dawson, an experienced space pilot, and Dr. Kiera Takahashi, a genius in alien linguistics. They embark on a daring mission to intercept the comet and investigate its mysterious core before it reaches the point of no return. During their journey, Evelyn and Mike struggle with the emotional weight of leaving their families behind, while Kiera wrestles with the morality of revealing the alien prophecy's existence to the world. Upon reaching Atlas, the team is captivated by the stunning out-gassing explosions triggered by sunlight. Digging deeper into the comet's core, they unravel a hidden alien technology manipulating its trajectory slowly pushing it towards Earth. The aliens' motives are unclear, but the threat to humanity is imminent. As they race against time, the team works on multiple possible interventions: altering Atlas's trajectory, disabling the alien device, or even obliterating the comet itself. While Kiera deciphers the alien codes, Evelyn and Mike maneuver their ship, planting explosives to break Atlas into smaller, harmless fragments, in a risky, disruptive operation. In a heart-stopping climax, the team completes their mission just as the ISA director sends military forces to halt their unauthorized interference. The celestial fireworks caused by Atlas's explosion light up the sky in a breathtaking spectacle, symbolizing Earth's narrow escape from doom. The alien messages cease, leaving Earth's authorities questioning the true intention behind the extraterrestrial manipulation. In the aftermath, Evelyn, Mike, and Kiera are hailed as heroes. Through their courage and unwavering determination, they not only save Earth but also gain insight into a fascinating celestial phenomenon that brings a thrilling galactic experience to humanity. The Celestial Fireworks movie ends on a hopeful note, with a prospect of future alliances with other advanced civilizations, the mysterious aliens' true motives, and a newfound appreciation for Earth's fragile existence within the vast universe."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Generally running in the northeast direction, the Expressway meets the NH 4 bypass (outer ring road) at Dehu Road outside Pune. From here, vehicles have the option to go to Pune or Pimpri Chinchwad. The expressway and old highway run together through the Sahyadri mountain range to navigate through the Bhor Ghat.

To conclude which is the most logical option for the <MASK> token, let's look at each option: A) Sahyadri – This is not the logical option, because Sahyadri is a mountain range through which the expressway passes. B) Mumbai – This is also not the logical option because Navi Mumbai is a separate city, and the statement mentions that the expressway starts within Navi Mumbai, not Mumbai. C) Pune – This is not the logical option because the expressway connects Navi Mumbai and Pune and does not start in Pune. D) Kalamboli – This is the most logical option as Kalamboli is a node located within the Navi Mumbai city where the expressway starts.

Given the below context:  Minogue's efforts to be taken seriously as a recording artist were initially hindered by the perception that she had not \\"paid her dues\\" and was no more than a manufactured pop star exploiting the image she had created during her stint on Neighbours. Minogue acknowledged this viewpoint, saying, \\"If you're part of a record company, I think to a degree it's fair to say that you're a manufactured product. You're a product and you're selling a product. It doesn't mean that you're not talented and that you don't make creative and business decisions about what you will and won't do and where you want to go.\\"In 1993, Baz Luhrmann introduced Minogue to photographer Bert Stern, notable for his work with Marilyn Monroe. Stern photographed her in Los Angeles and, comparing her to Monroe, commented that Minogue had a similar mix of vulnerability and eroticism. Throughout her career, Minogue has chosen photographers who attempt to create a new \\"look\\" for her, and the resulting photographs have appeared in a variety of magazines, from the cutting edge The Face to the more traditionally sophisticated Vogue and Vanity Fair, making the Minogue face and name known to a broad range of people. Stylist William Baker has suggested that this is part of the reason she entered mainstream pop culture in Europe more successfully than many other pop singers who concentrate solely on selling records.By 2000, Minogue was considered to have achieved a degree of musical credibility for having maintained her career longer than her critics had expected. Her progression from the wholesome \\"girl next door\\" to a more sophisticated performer with a flirtatious and playful persona attracted new fans.

Given the question: Yes. I had a stress heart attack five years ago. My step-son is a heroin addict. He will be on an opioid agonist for the rest of his life. His behavior mirrored the worst of what addicts do to a family. I was desperate to make a change, and my husband was desperate to save his son’s life. That meant having to watch my husband support my step-son as he abused me and my children. Multiple criminal behaviors, many times the police came to the house, two convictions, long-term parole. Watching him threaten to kill me, kill his father, and kill his younger brother and sister. Add to that a very stress job situation with a new boss who decided he needed a new VP, but had no basis to terminate my employment, so instead was determined to make my work life a living hell on earth. So, yep, I had a heart attack. I’m still angry at everything that led up to the heart attack. I’m working really hard on forgiving my husband, forgiving my step-son, and the overwhelming guilt of my children seeing me as an accomplice to their abuse. I found a new job, and then had the pleasure of seeing my former boss fired by the Board of Directors. Since then I find I’m hyper-vigilant in issues of child abuse, worker abuse, addiction, lying and deceit (Trump trigger), and feeling somewhat betrayed by my husband. I honestly think if it had been one of my children doing the abusing, I would have found a way to put my child into long-term rehab.

Bellamy is convinced of his guilt but Anne is less sure. Much of her practice is with troubled young people and she feels there is more to the story than the police evidence. Anne visits Harry in prison. He is depressed and distrustful but finally agrees to talk to her.

He asked the driver of a car parked in the copse nearby for help but he was occupied with his girl and refused. Harry was spotted by a policeman on a bike who stopped to help.

A close up of a cat is seen sitting in a person's lap. the person","output":"starts petting the cat gently.  Step 1: Assuming that the cat is comfortable with the person, they would first softly speak to the cat to avoid startling it. This step is essential to ensure that the cat feels safe and at ease in the interaction. Step 2: Observing the cat's body language and reactions, the person would slowly move their hand closer to the cat's body. The reasoning behind this step is to not make any sudden movements that could scare or stress the cat. Step 3: The person starts petting the cat gently, beginning with the cat's head and moving along its back. This action is selected because most cats tend to enjoy being petted on these areas and it ensures that the person is approaching the interaction with respect for the cat's boundaries. Step 4: Throughout the petting session, the person should continuously observe the cat's body language for signs of unease or discomfort, such as flattened ears, twitching tail, or growling. This step is important to make sure the cat is still comfortable and to prevent any potential negative reactions like scratching or biting. Step 5: Depending on how receptive the cat is to the person's touch, the person may try petting other areas, such as the chin or behind the ears. This step is an optional exploration to see if the cat enjoys being petted at additional spots while still being cautious not to cross any boundaries. Step 6: The person will continue petting the cat until either the cat demonstrates that it wants the interaction to end (e.g., moving away or showing signs of discomfort) or the person decides to stop.

Trump said he did not make any promises to Carson about a future role in a potential Trump administration, but pledged that Carson would play a \\"big, big part\\" in his campaign.      Carson -- whose campaign and demeanor were polar opposites of Trump's in many ways -- played the role Friday of vouching for Trump's character and integrity. He explained that there were \\"two Donald Trumps\\" -- one that the public sees, and another more reserved and \\"cerebral\\" man who \\"sits there and considers things very carefully.\\"      \\"Some people have gotten the impression that Donald Trump is this person who is not malleable, who does not have the ability to listen, and to take information in and make wise decisions. And that's not true,\\" Carson said. \\"He's much more cerebral than that.\\"      Carson became the second former presidential candidate to back to Trump. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie endorsed the businessman two weeks ago.      Earlier this week, Carson had indicated that he would be open to backing either Trump or Ted Cruz. Carson and Cruz's relationship hit a rocky patch around the first GOP primary contest in Iowa, when the Cruz campaign incorrectly told precinct captains while the caucuses were taking place that Carson may be dropping out of the race. Carson called on Cruz to take responsibility and fire whoever was responsible for the \\"blatant lying,\\" and Cruz subsequently apologized.      On Friday, Carson -- a Seventh Day Adventist -- insisted that he had no lingering hard feelings towards the Texas senator.      \\"I have completely forgiven him. That's a duty one has as a Christian,\\" he said.      On the tense exchanges that he has had with Trump this cycle, Carson said all of that was also history. \\"We moved on because it's not about me. It's not about Mr. Trump. This is about America.\\"      Trump praised Carson throughout his press conference.      \\"Having (Carson's) support, really, it just adds total credence to what I'm trying to do and to what we're all trying to do,\\" Trump said, introducing Carson.      Trump says establishment is coming around      Coming off of an unusually civil CNN Republican debate on Thursday night that lacked in personal insults and attacks, Trump exuded confidence about the trajectory of his campaign. Fielding questions from reporters for about 45 minutes, Trump said he is hopeful about clinching the nomination by getting 1,237 delegates and avoid a situation in which the nominee is chosen at the Republican convention over the summer. Looking ahead to next week, he predicted that he could defeat Ohio Gov. John Kasich in his home state.      Trump suggested that establishment Republicans are beginning to rally around him in private conversations. He once again said he had a respectful conversation with House Speaker Paul Ryan this week, and though he declined to name names, he said he had heard from \\"virtually everybody in the Republican Party.\\"      One person he has not had contact with: Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.

Learn more ||||| Carson: 'There are two different Donald Trumps' The real estate mogul agrees with Carson, before quickly reversing himself.      Ben Carson cracked open an awkward conversation for Donald Trump as he threw his backing behind his former rival and justified the move by saying, “There are two different Donald Trumps.”      The real estate mogul, speaking at a news conference on Friday morning, conceded the point — “perhaps there are two Donald Trumps” — before reversing himself after reporters seized on the comment. “I don’t think there are two Donald Trumps.”      Story Continued Below      The surreal, extraordinary moment revealed Trump’s struggle as he gets closer to sewing up the Republican nomination and shifts to the general election — trying to broaden his appeal without alienating devoted supporters drawn to his theatrical style and hard-line views.      Right off the bat, the retired neurosurgeon addressed the elephant in the room: the history of past insults and bad blood between himself and Trump.      “Well, first of all, we buried the hatchet,\\" Carson said, referring to Trump’s accusation of Carson being a pathological liar who showed the same destructive tendencies as a child molester. \\"That was political stuff. And, you know, that happens in American politics, the politics of personal destruction. All that is not something that I particularly believe in or anything that I get involved in. But I do recognize that it is a part of the process. We move on because it’s not about me, it’s not about Mr. Trump. It’s about America.”      Then Carson gave voice to what many have suspected — Trump the presidential candidate has so far largely been an act.      Breaking down his logic for endorsing Trump, Carson remarked that there was \\"a lot more alignment philosophically and spiritually than I ever thought there was\\" between him and Trump.      \\"First of all, I’ve come to know Donald Trump over the last few years. He’s actually a very intelligent man who cares deeply about America,\\" Carson said. \\"There are two different Donald Trumps. There’s the one you see on the stage and there’s the one who’s very cerebral, sits there and considers things very carefully.      And Carson previewed Trump, the general election candidate, one who will be able to go toe-to-toe with Hillary Clinton, the policy wonk.      “You can have a very good conversation with him, and that’s the Donald Trump that you’re going to see more and more of right now,” he said.      Although the retired neurosurgeon had previewed the double Trump claim during a radio interview on Thursday, bringing up the split before a room full of reporters set off a chain reaction as the media nudged Trump to drop the mask, if there really is one.      \\"Perhaps there are two Donald Trumps,\\" the real estate mogul said, when asked about Carson’s comment. \\"I’m somebody who is a thinker. I’m a big thinker. I have my ideas, and they’re strong, and typically they’ve worked out.”      But when pressed further about why there are, in fact, \\"two Donald Trumps,\\" Trump abruptly reversed himself.      \\"I don't think there's two Donald Trumps. I think there's one Donald Trump, but certainly, you have, look, all of this, and you have somebody else that sits and reads and thinks and I'm a thinker, and I have been a thinker. And perhaps people don't think of me that way because you don't see me in that forum, but I am a thinker,\\" he said. \\"I'm a very deep thinker. I know what's happening.\\"      Trump, who was widely dismissed as an amusing sideshow when he made his rambling announcement speech in June, has evolved as he closes in on the 1,237 delegates he needs to clinch the GOP nomination.      He has started moderating his views on torture, saying he would seek to change the laws instead of flouting international conventions, and has opened the door to negotiating on his far-right immigration stances. He’s also started staking out some new positions, saying at Thursday night’s debate that he would deploy as many as 30,000 American soldiers in the Middle East to defeat the Islamic State, and that he won’t rule out accepting outside contributions in the general election.      But even as he shifts his gaze to the general election, he’s not dialed down the bombast that has lured millions of angry Americans he used to fondly call “the silent majority.” He’s under fresh fire for appearing to encourage violent clashes between his supporters and protesters at his rallies. And his campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, is fielding calls for him to resign after allegedly almost throwing a Breitbart reporter to the ground as she tried to ask Trump a question.      Speaking at the news conference on Friday, Trump was eager to move past the armchair psychology.      \\"I don't like to over-analyze myself, but I try to be who I am. Certain questions are asked to me, and I give a straight answer as opposed to a politically correct answer. I know the politically correct business better than anybody,\\" Trump said, then talking about his latest inflammatory comment that “Islam hates America.”      And he focused on extolling the virtues of Carson, even as he reveled in how he ended up crushing him.      Trump said he \\"actually gained a lot of respect\\" for the retired neurosurgeon through his \\"silence and strength\\" in facing off with his rhetorical broadsides. “I could not lose that guy,\\" Trump said, in discussing his respect for Carson as a candidate in the polls.      \\"And I was doing well and you know, Trump would be at 28 at that time, and I remember when it was 28 and Ben was 18, and then he was 19, and the next week it was like 22, and I was like, 'Whoa, whoa, what's this happening here? I don't like this.' Right?\\" Trump said, turning to Carson.      Carson flashed a quick, congenial grin.      Referring to an early November poll that showed Carson with a 6-point lead on him, Trump declared, \\"It was the biggest story worldwide. I said, this guy is unbelievable. And so, I started going after Ben. It's politics, and Ben understands that.\\"      He went on to brag about a list of unscientific online polls, showing him as the winner of Thursday night’s debate, before saying it’s time to move on. \\"We've had enough debates, in my opinion. These debates have been like, Vince McMahon should have put them on, because they were like WWE,\\" said Trump, who himself appeared at WWE's WrestleMania in 2007.      Carson also laid out his argument for the party and country to unify around Trump as the nominee and president — warning Trump's opponents not to try to mess with him.      \\"I want the voice of the people to be heard. I want the political process to play out in the way that it should play out, and I think the Republican Party particularly would be very wise not to adopt, let’s stop this guy and let’s promote this guy's policy, but rather start thinking about what are the things that are going to be helpful in America,\\" Carson said. ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"Ben Carson is a retired doctor who wanted to be the president of the United States.

Select from the following. (i) If they're fabric, wash in the washer with other winter gear on gentle with cold water. (ii) If they're fabric, wash in the washer with other winter gear on heavily soiled with hot water.","output":"Cleaning your winter gloves requires careful consideration of their fabric and manufacturer's instructions to maintain their quality and functionality. To make the right decision, assess the type of material and the level of soiling on your gloves before choosing between the two available options:  Option (i): If your winter gloves are made of fabric and are not heavily soiled, it is advisable to wash them in the washer with other winter gear on gentle with cold water. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to clean your fabric gloves using this method: 1. Check the care label: To maintain the integrity of your winter gloves, always follow the manufacturer's care label instructions regarding water temperature, cycle settings, and recommended detergents. 2. Pre-treat stains: Gently rub a stain remover on any visibly dirty areas or spots before putting your gloves in the washing machine. 3. Use a gentle detergent: Choose a mild detergent that is suitable for delicate fabrics. Harsh detergents may damage the fabric or compromise the gloves' insulation properties and waterproof features. 4. Choose the right cycle: Set your washing machine to a gentle cycle with cold water. It's essential to use cold water to avoid any damage or shrinkage to your gloves and winter gear. 5. Add additional protection: To secure the gloves during the wash cycle, place them in a mesh laundry bag. This will prevent them from getting tangled with other items or damaged inside the drum. 6. Wash with similar items: Combine the gloves with other winter gear made from similar materials and colors to maximize the washing machine's efficiency while protecting the gloves from harsher treatment. 7. Air-dry your gloves: Do not use a dryer to dry your winter gloves. Instead, let them air-dry by laying them flat in a cool, dry place away from direct sunlight. This will help retain their shape and prevent damage to the fabric. Option (ii): If your winter gloves are fabric and heavily soiled, washing them in the washer with other winter gear on heavily soiled with hot water can help remove tough stains. However, be cautious with this option. Hot water may cause damage or shrinkage to the gloves, especially if they are made from natural fibers like wool. Check the care label instructions first for any specific guidance on water temperature or cycle settings. If it allows washing in hot water for heavily soiled items, proceed with the following steps: 1. Check the care label: Follow the care label instructions for temperature adjustment, cycle settings, and detergent recommendations. 2. Pre-treat stains: Apply a stain remover on stubborn stains and allow it to sit for a few minutes before placing them in the washer. 3. Use appropriate detergent: Select a detergent that is effective on heavily soiled garments while still being suitable for the fabric type of your gloves. 4. Choose the right cycle: Set your washing machine to a heavily soiled cycle with hot water, ensuring that the temperature complies with the care label's guidance. 5. Add additional protection: Place your heavily soiled gloves in a mesh laundry bag for protection during the wash cycle. 6. Wash with similar items: Combine the gloves with other heavily soiled winter gear made from similar materials and colors. 7. Air-dry your gloves: Always air-dry your winter gloves by laying them flat in a cool, dry place, away from direct sunlight. In conclusion, the appropriate method for cleaning your winter gloves depends on their fabric and level of soiling. Always prioritize following the manufacturer's care instructions and opt for a milder approach (gentle cycle with cold water) whenever possible. Only use the heavily soiled cycle with hot water if the care label explicitly allows it and if your gloves are excessively dirty."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

One year earlier, Christian moved to the Montmartre district of Paris to become a writer among members of the area's Bohemian movement. He encounters performers led by Toulouse-Lautrec; his writing skills allow them to finish their proposed show, \\"Spectacular Spectacular\\", that they wish to sell to Harold Zidler, owner of the Moulin Rouge. The group arrives at the Moulin Rouge as Zidler and his \\"Diamond Dog Dancers\\" perform for the audience (\\"Lady Marmalade/Zidler's Rap (Can Can)/Smells Like Teen Spirit\\").

Summarize this article: Spend some time looking at different Etsy sellers, especially successful ones, to find your niche in the market. Think about how your artwork can stand out from the crowd. Consider how your work is different and how you can bring a unique perspective to what is already selling on Etsy. For example, you may use the Etsy search bar to look up sellers who are making artwork that is similar to yours. You may notice what types of artwork they sell as well as their price points and their type of clientele. Consider the age group and demographic you want to sell to. Are you trying to make artwork for a younger audience, such as children? Do you want to make artwork for an older audience, such as individuals looking for artwork for their homes or offices? Think about how you can appeal to a specific customer or niche on Etsy. For example, you may try doing animal portraits in cross stitch, rather than paint animal portraits, as these are already popular on Etsy. Or you may create custom abstract art for interiors in interesting materials like spray paint and fabric to stand out. For your artwork to be sold on Etsy, it must be handmade and/or designed by you. If you have a design partner, you must disclose this on your shop. You will also need to disclose every person involved in the making of the item.  You cannot resell items that were not handmade or designed by you. You must be honest and forthcoming in your descriptions of items and in the information you provide about your shop. Appeal to a variety of shoppers by carrying artwork that ranges in price. Try to have artwork that is on the more affordable side and on the more expensive side. Giving variety can open up your shop to a wide range of buyers and encourage your customers return to buy more.  Etsy finds that items 50 USD and under tend to be the most popular. You may use 50 USD as your base price and price your items up or down from there. For example, you may have several pieces that are in the 50-100 USD range or in the 0-50 USD range. You may then offer a few larger or more detailed pieces in the 100-200 USD range. Do not be afraid to offer artwork that is more expensive, as some art buyers are drawn to more expensive work that is original and one of a kind. Summary:","output":"To succeed on Etsy, research successful sellers and find your niche in the market. Focus on creating unique artworks that stand out and appeal to a specific customer demographic.

Read the following paragraph and determine if the hypothesis is true: How to prove similar triangles<br>Define the angle-angle (aa) theorem. Two triangles can be proved similar by the angle-angle theorem which states: if two triangles have two congruent angles, then those triangles are similar. [substeps] This theorem is also called the angle-angle-angle (aaa) theorem because if two angles of the triangle are congruent, the third angle must also be congruent. Hypothesis: There is an exact way to prove similar triangles","output":"After reading the provided paragraph and analyzing the information given, we can conclude that the hypothesis stating \\"There is an exact way to prove similar triangles\\" is true. The Angle-Angle (AA) Theorem, as detailed in the paragraph, provides a clear and exact method for proving the similarity of two triangles. Let's further elaborate on the AA (or AAA) Theorem and its application in proving triangle similarity: According to the Angle-Angle Theorem, two triangles are considered similar if they have two congruent (equal) angles. It is important to note that in a triangle, the sum of the internal angles always adds up to 180 degrees. Therefore, when two angles of a triangle are congruent to two angles of another triangle, it inherently implies that their third angles are also congruent. This is why the theorem is also referred to as the Angle-Angle-Angle (AAA) Theorem. To apply the AA Theorem in proving the similarity of two triangles, follow these steps: 1. Identify the corresponding angles: For two triangles to be similar, their corresponding angles must be equal. So the first step is to identify which angles correspond between the two triangles. 2. Check for congruence of at least two pairs of corresponding angles: Once you've identified the corresponding angles, check whether at least two pairs of these angles are congruent. If their measures are equal, then the two pairs of angles are congruent. 3. Determine the similarity of the triangles: If at least two pairs of corresponding angles are congruent, then by the AA Theorem, the two triangles are proven to be similar. The AA Theorem's ability to prove the similarity of triangles is a direct result of the properties of triangles, particularly the fact that the sum of their internal angles is always equal to 180 degrees. This requirement for triangles ensures that, whenever two pairs of corresponding angles are congruent, their third pair will also be congruent, thereby satisfying the necessary conditions for similarity. In conclusion, the hypothesis is true, and there is indeed an exact way to prove similar triangles, which is through the Angle-Angle (AA) Theorem. This theorem provides a systematic and precise approach to determining triangle similarity by focusing on the congruence of their corresponding angles."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Sometimes you need to make phone calls to get a job. Calling is the first step where you can show your ability to an employer. Here are some tried and true tips: Get the person responsible You need to talk directly to the person who would supervise you. In a small business, you might ask to speak to the \\"person in charge\\". In a larger one, you would ask for the name of the person in charge of the particular department you're interested in. Get the name of the person If you don't have the name of the person you need to speak to, ask for it. Usually, you will be given the supervisor's name and your call will be transferred to him or her. Get past the receptionist In some cases, receptionists and secretaries will try to screen out your call. If they find out that you're looking for a job, they may transfer you to the Personnel Department or ask you to send an application or resume. Here are some ways to keep from getting screened out: * Call back Call back a day later and say you are getting ready to send some correspondence   to the person who manages such and such. You want to use the correct name and title and request that they give you this information. And this approach usually gets you what you need. Say \\"thank you\\" and call back in a day or so. Then ask for the supervisor or manager by name. * Call when the secretary is out You are likely to get right through if you call when the receptionist is out to lunch. Other good times are just before and after normal work hours. Less experienced staff members are likely to answer the phone and put you right through. Ask three times for an interview Sometimes, the supervisor you contact just simply rejects you. Then, you can try asking three times for an interview! Although this approach does not always work, asking the third time works more often than most people would believe. Arrange a time If the person agrees to an interview, arrange a specific date and time. Question: In the writer's opinion, who should you talk to if you want to get a job by making phone calls?

The seductive sheen, the rumble, the combustive power of automobiles called to him like a siren at sea. He coveted the sense of possibility inherent in the turn of a key. And the MG-TD held a place high in his list of hope. British Racing Green, wood dashboard and a four-stroke engine. He had only seen one MG-TD, when he'd gone on holiday with his folks to the U.K. They had been walking down the street in downtown London. Most of the traffic had been pedestrian or cyclist. The occasional fuel-cell car glided by like a ghostly leftover from the Vehicular Age. Double-decker biodiesel buses roared past regularly, trailing the odor of fish and chips after them. And then it came down the street toward them. A car that purred as its rounded lines soaked up the sun with a green so deep it was almost black. It pulled into the valet parking of a grand hotel and two people got out. Aage barely noticed them. He stared inside the car, where chrome and brass gleamed against a burled wood dashboard. The doors of the car shut with the heavy thunk of real metal. A valet pulled the car out of the parking circle and Aage never saw it again. After the end of this story, Aage is experiencing: Pick the correct answer from the following options: - Longing - not enough information - The security of having enough funds to afford multiple cars - The joy of driving his new car A:","output":"Aage is experiencing longing. The vivid recollection of the 1952 MG-TD he saw during his holiday in the UK has left a lasting impression on him. The description of the car's purr, its deep green color, and the burled wood dashboard highlights the fascination he has for the Vehicular Age. Aage's yearning for this particular car is so strong that he tries to convince his mother to help him buy one, despite her concerns about the co-op members and him not being able to afford it. Aage's longing is further emphasized by his inability to understand or explain his fascination with automobiles from the Vehicular Age to his mother. The seductive sheen, rumble, and combustive power of these cars captivate him, and they call to him like a siren at sea. This demonstrates how deeply his longing runs, as it's compared to a mythical force that will not let go. Additionally, the mention of his encounter with the MG-TD in London showcases the sense of possibility inherent in the turn of a key. This desire for freedom and control is a strong driving force behind his longing for the car. The moment when the valet drives away with the car he admires, leaving Aage with a lasting memory and an even stronger desire to own one, further intensifies his yearning. In conclusion, the correct answer to the question of what Aage is experiencing after the end of this story is a profound longing. His fascination with the Vehicular Age, coupled with the unforgettable memory of the MG-TD, drives his desire to own this classic car, even when faced with the reality of not being able to afford it and not having the support of his mother. His longing permeates his thoughts and emotions, just like the deep green color of the British Racing MG-TD."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

According to Sentence 1, 5 million green-card holders living in the United States in 1996 were eligible to apply for U.S. citizenship. This means that those individuals who possessed a green card, which is essentially a permit allowing a foreign national to live and work in the United States permanently, were allowed to apply for U.S. citizenship. U.S. citizenship would grant them numerous rights and benefits, including the right to vote, run for public office, and access better job opportunities.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: -  The flu virus has receptors, which are like viral Velcro, on the surface of the virus particle - The receptors will lock onto a target cell using these chemical receptors on the surface, which docks onto the cell surface - The receptors  then go into the cell - The receptors use it like a factory - The receptors take it over and make it produce thousands or in some cases millions of copies of new viruses - The copies come streaming out of the cell  What might be the last step of the process? A:","output":"A: The last step of the process involves the release of newly produced virus particles from the host cell, which subsequently infect neighboring cells and continue the cycle of viral replication. This release can happen through two main mechanisms: 1. Budding: In this process, new virus particles become enveloped in a portion of the host cell's membrane. As they push against the cell membrane, they eventually bud off from the surface of the host cell, acquiring an outer layer made from the host cell's lipids. Afterward, the newly generated virus particles are ready to infect other cells. 2. Lysis: In this process, the large number of replicated virus particles accumulate within the host cell, causing it to swell and ultimately rupture or lyse. This cell lysis releases the newly produced virus particles into the extracellular environment, where they can infect nearby cells and continue the viral replication process. Following the release of new virus particles, the host cell usually dies, which can cause damage and inflammation to the surrounding tissue. This leads to the symptoms associated with viral infections, such as fever, cough, and other flu-like symptoms."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Please answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Nature is full of color, from rainbows and roses to butterfly wings and peacock tails. Even the fruits and vegetables you eat have different colors: blue blueberries, red strawberries, green broccoli, and orange carrots. Plant and animals often use color to attract attention. The substances responsible for these colors belong to a class of chemical called antioxidants . Plants make antioxidant to protect themselves from the sun's ultraviolet(UV) light. Ultraviolet light causes chemicals called free radicals to form within plant cells. They can destroy parts of plant. Free radicals also have damaging effects on human beings. Some of these effects like wrinkled skin can be seen. The damage is caused by the free radicals attacking cells in our bodies. Certain cancers and heart disease are linked to free radicals. Our bodies have natural defences for fighting off free radicals. While we are young, our defences are pretty strong. However, they get weaker as we get older. The body's built-in defences can only go so far without extra help. The key to fighting free radicals with fruits and vegetables is to mix and match colors. It's like sunscreen for the inside of your body. Go for a range of very bright colors. Colorful foods contain hundreds of healthy chemicals not found anywhere else. Research into how chemicals in blueberries affect the brain's function in rats suggests that these chemicals may help our own brains work more efficiently. Don't just blame the sun.

They are part of Aphrodite's retinue. \\"Erotes\\" (Greek ) is the plural of \\"Eros\\" (\\"Love, Desire\\"), who as a singular deity has a more complex mythology.  - Psychoanalytic theory is the theory of personality organization and the dynamics of personality development that guides psychoanalysis, a clinical method for treating psychopathology. First laid out by Sigmund Freud in the late 19th century, psychoanalytic theory has undergone many refinements since his work. Psychoanalytic theory came to full prominence in the last third of the twentieth century as part of the flow of critical discourse regarding psychological treatments after the 1960s, long after Freud's death in 1939, and its validity is now widely disputed or rejected. Freud had ceased his analysis of the brain and his physiological studies and shifted his focus to the study of the mind and the related psychological attributes making up the mind, and on treatment using free association and the phenomena of transference. His study emphasized the recognition of childhood events that could influence the mental functioning of adults. His examination of the genetic and then the developmental aspects gave the psychoanalytic theory its characteristics. Starting with his publication of \\"The Interpretation of Dreams\\" in 1899, his theories began to gain prominence.  - Psychopathology is the scientific study of mental disorders, including efforts to understand their genetic, biological, psychological, and social causes; effective classification schemes (nosology); course across all stages of development; manifestations; and treatment. The term may also refer to the manifestation of behaviors that indicate the presence of a mental disorder.  - Sigmund Freud ( born Sigismund Schlomo Freud; 6 May 1856  23 September 1939) was an Austrian neurologist and the founder of psychoanalysis, a clinical method for treating psychopathology through dialogue between a patient and a psychoanalyst. Freud was born to Galician Jewish parents in the Moravian town of Freiberg, in the Austro-Hungarian Empire. He qualified as a doctor of medicine in 1881 at the University of Vienna. Upon completing his habilitation in 1885, he was appointed a docent in neuropathology and became an affiliated professor in 1902. Freud lived and worked in Vienna, having set up his clinical practice there in 1886. In 1938 Freud left Austria to escape the Nazis. He died in exile in the United Kingdom in 1939.  - Aphrodite (; Greek: (\\"Afrodíti\\")) is the Greek goddess of love, beauty, pleasure, and procreation. She is identified with the planet Venus, and her Roman equivalent is the goddess .  - In classical mythology, Cupid (Latin Cupido, meaning \\"desire\\") is the god of desire, erotic love, attraction and affection. He is often portrayed as the son of the love goddess Venus and the war god Mars, and is known in Latin also as \\"Amor\\" (\\"Love\\"). His Greek counterpart is Eros.  - Testosterone is the primary male sex hormone and an anabolic steroid. In men, testosterone plays a key role in the development of male reproductive tissues such as the testis and prostate, as well as promoting secondary sexual characteristics such as increased muscle and bone mass, and the growth of body hair. In addition, testosterone is essential for health and well-being, and for the prevention of osteoporosis. Insufficient levels of testosterone in men may lead to abnormalities including frailty and bone loss.  - Greek mythology is the body of myths and teachings that belong to the ancient Greeks, concerning their gods and heroes, the nature of the world, and the origins and significance of their own cult and ritual practices. It was a part of the religion in ancient Greece. Modern scholars refer to and study the myths in an attempt to shed light on the religious and political institutions of Ancient Greece and its civilization, and to gain understanding of the nature of myth-making itself.  - The University of Vienna is a public university located in Vienna, Austria. It was founded by Duke Rudolph IV in 1365 and is one of the oldest universities in the German-speaking world. With its long and rich history, the University of Vienna has developed into one of the biggest universities in Europe, and also one of the most renowned, especially in the Humanities. It is associated with 15 Nobel prize winners and has been the academic home of a large number of figures both of historical and academic importance.  - Psychoanalysis is a set of theories and therapeutic techniques related to the study of the unconscious mind, which together form a method of treatment for mental-health disorders. The discipline was established in the early 1890s by Austrian neurologist Sigmund Freud and stemmed partly from the clinical work of Josef Breuer and others.  - In Greek mythology, Thanatos ([] \\"Death\\", from  \\"thnsk\\" \\"to die, be dying\\") was the personification of death. He was a minor figure in Greek mythology, often referred to, but rarely appearing in person.  - Vienna is the capital and largest city of Austria and one of the nine states of Austria. Vienna is Austria's primary city, with a population of about 1.8 million (2.6 million within the metropolitan area, nearly one third of Austria's population), and its cultural, economic, and political centre. It is the 7th-largest city by population within city limits in the European Union. Until the beginning of the 20th century, it was the largest German-speaking city in the world, and before the splitting of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in World War I, the city had 2 million inhabitants. Today, it has the second largest number of German speakers after Berlin. Vienna is host to many major international organizations, including the United Nations and OPEC. The city is located in the eastern part of Austria and is close to the borders of the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and Hungary. These regions work together in a European Centrope border region. Along with nearby Bratislava, Vienna forms a metropolitan region with 3 million inhabitants. In 2001, the city centre was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site.  - Beyond the Pleasure Principle ( German : Jenseits des Lustprinzips ) is a 1920 essay by Sigmund Freud that marks a major turning point in his theoretical approach . Previously , Freud attributed most human behavior to the sexual instinct ( Eros or libido ) . With this essay , Freud went \`\` beyond '' the simple pleasure principle , developing his theory of drives with the addition of the death drive ( s ) ( Todestrieb ( e ) ) ( often referred to as \`\` Thanatos '' ) .  - Hypersexuality is a clinical diagnosis used by mental healthcare researchers and providers to describe extremely frequent or suddenly increased sexual urges or sexual activity. The terms nymphomania and satyriasis were once used to describe the condition, in women and men respectively, but are no longer in general medical use, although the former is still used colloquially.  - Moravia  is a historical country in the Czech Republic (forming its eastern part) and one of the historical Czech lands, together with Bohemia and Czech Silesia. The medieval and early modern Margraviate of Moravia was a crown land of the Lands of the Bohemian Crown (from 1348 to 1918), an imperial state of the Holy Roman Empire (1004 to 1806), later a crown land of the Austrian Empire (1804 to 1867) and briefly also one of 17 former crown lands of the Cisleithanian part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire from 1867 to 1918. During the early 20th century, Moravia was one of the five lands of Czechoslovakia from 1918 to 1928; it was then merged with Czech Silesia, and eventually dissolved by abolition of the land system in 1949.  - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union.  - In Greek mythology, Eros (or ,  \\"Desire\\") was the Greek god of love. His Roman counterpart was Cupid (\\"desire\\"). Some myths make him a primordial god, while in other myths, he is the son of Aphrodite. He was one of the winged love gods, Erotes.  - Puberty is the process of physical changes through which a child's body matures into an adult body capable of sexual reproduction. It is initiated by hormonal signals from the brain to the gonads: the ovaries in a girl, the testes in a boy. In response to the signals, the gonads produce hormones that stimulate libido and the growth, function, and transformation of the brain, bones, muscle, blood, skin, hair, breasts, and sex organs. Physical growthheight and weightaccelerates in the first half of puberty and is completed when an adult body has been developed. Until the maturation of their reproductive capabilities, the pre-pubertal physical differences between boys and girls are the external sex organs.  - In classical Freudian psychoanalytic theory, the death drive is the drive towards death and self-destruction. It was originally proposed by Sabina Spielrein in her paper \\"Destruction as the Cause of Coming Into Being\\" (\\"\\"Die Destruktion als Ursache des Werdens\\"\\") which was then taken up by Sigmund Freud in 1920 in \\"Beyond the Pleasure Principle.\\" This concept has been translated as, \\"opposition between the ego or death instincts and the sexual or life instincts\\". In \\"Pleasure Principle\\", Freud used the plural \\"death drives\\" (\\"Todestriebe\\") much more frequently than in the singular.  - Neuropathology is the study of disease of nervous system tissue, usually in the form of either small surgical biopsies or whole-body autopsies. Neuropathology is a subspecialty of anatomic pathology, neurology, and neurosurgery. It should not be confused with neuropathy, which refers to disorders of the nerves themselves (usually in the peripheral nervous system).  - Libido, colloquially known as sex drive, is a person's overall sexual drive or desire for sexual activity. Sex drive is influenced by biological, psychological and social factors. Biologically, the sex hormones and associated neurotransmitters that act upon the nucleus accumbens (primarily testosterone and dopamine, respectively) regulate libido in humans. Social factors, such as work and family, and internal psychological factors, like personality and stress, can affect libido. Sex drive can also be affected by medical conditions, medications, lifestyle and relationship issues, and age (e.g., puberty). A person who has extremely frequent or a suddenly increased sex drive may be experiencing hypersexuality, while the opposite condition is hyposexuality.  - Instinct or innate behavior is the inherent inclination of a living organism towards a particular complex behavior. The simplest example of an instinctive behavior is a fixed action pattern (FAP), in which a very short to medium length sequence of actions, without variation, are carried out in response to a clearly defined stimulus.

Hypothesis: We are highly honoured. Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","output":"In order to analyze whether the hypothesis \\"We are highly honoured\\" is entailed by the premise \\"We are greatly honoured,\\" we need to first understand the meanings of the words \\"greatly\\" and \\"highly\\" and how they relate to the context of honour. Additionally, we should consider the principles of entailment and how they apply in this particular case. Entailment, in the context of logic and reasoning, is a relationship between two statements where the truth of one statement necessarily implies the truth of another. More specifically, if one statement entails another, it means that whenever the first statement is true, the second statement must also be true. Now, let's examine the words \\"greatly\\" and \\"highly.\\" Both are adverbs that are often used to modify adjectives or other adverbs, and they both convey the idea of \\"to a great extent\\" or \\"to a high degree.\\" In the given context of honour, we can understand them as referring to a level of respect, admiration, or appreciation. \\"Greatly\\" is defined as: 1. To an extent that is much above the normal or average level. 2. To a very high degree or intensity. \\"Highly\\" is defined as: 1. To a high degree, notably above the average. 2. At or to a large extent, in a high quantity, or with great intensity. Considering these definitions, it's clear that both \\"greatly\\" and \\"highly\\" convey a sense of being above average or normal levels when it comes to the concept of honour. Now, let's return to the question of whether the hypothesis \\"We are highly honoured\\" is entailed by the premise \\"We are greatly honoured.\\" Given that both \\"greatly\\" and \\"highly\\" point to a level of honour above the average or normal, the two can be reasonably considered to be equivalent in meaning. This equivalence in meaning suggests that the truth of the premise does, in fact, imply the truth of the hypothesis. If \\"we are greatly honoured\\" is true, then it follows that \\"we are highly honoured\\" must also be true. Therefore, based on the analysis and definitions provided, it can be concluded that the hypothesis \\"We are highly honoured\\" is entailed by the premise \\"We are greatly honoured.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Sentence 1: Block a nerve. In this sentence, \\"block\\" seems to be related to a physical or medical process, possibly interrupting the function of a nerve in the body. Sentence 2: You are blocking the name of your first wife! Here, \\"blocking\\" seems to refer to someone forgetting or repressing a memory, specifically the name of their first wife.

In the first sentence, \\"block\\" refers to a physical or medical action that impacts the function of a nerve. In the second sentence, \\"block\\" refers to the act of forgetting or repressing a memory.

The composer Ned Rorem observed, \\"He was deeply devout and uncontrollably sensual\\"; this still leads some critics to underrate his seriousness. His uncompromising adherence to melody, both in his lighter and serious works, has similarly caused some to regard him as unprogressive. Although he was not much influenced by new developments in music, Poulenc was always keenly interested in the works of younger generations of composers. Lennox Berkeley recalled, \\"Unlike some artists, he was genuinely interested in other people's work, and surprisingly appreciative of music very far removed from his. I remember him playing me the records of Boulez's Le marteau sans maître with which he was already familiar when that work was much less well-known than it is today.\\" Boulez did not take a reciprocal view, remarking in 2010, \\"There are always people who will take an easy intellectual path. Poulenc coming after Sacre [du Printemps]. It was not progress.\\" Other composers have found more merit in Poulenc's work; Stravinsky wrote to him in 1931: \\"You are truly good, and that is what I find again and again in your music\\".In his last years Poulenc observed, \\"if people are still interested in my music in 50 years' time it will be for my Stabat Mater rather than the Mouvements perpétuels.\\" In a centenary tribute in The Times Gerald Larner commented that Poulenc's prediction was wrong, and that in 1999 the composer was widely celebrated for both sides of his musical character: \\"both the fervent Catholic and the naughty boy, for both the Gloria and Les Biches, both Les Dialogues des Carmélites and Les Mamelles de Tirésias.\\" At around the same time the writer Jessica Duchen described Poulenc as \\"a fizzing, bubbling mass of Gallic energy who can move you to both laughter and tears within seconds.

Derrick said socks would help because","output":"At night, Craig always got cold feet. Derrick said socks would help because they serve as an additional layer of insulation that traps and retains the body's natural warmth, keeping the feet cozy and comfortable throughout the night. Socks, especially those made from materials like wool, cotton, or fleece, possess excellent thermal properties ideal for maintaining warmth. These materials provide insulation by using the tiny air pockets within their fabric fibers to catch and hold body heat. The trapped air then forms a buffer between the skin and the cooler ambient/environmental temperature, which substantially slows down the heat loss process. Consequently, Craig's feet will be able to remain at a more comfortable and constant temperature, preventing him from experiencing the unpleasant sensation of cold feet during the night. Moreover, socks also prevent heat escape by minimizing direct contact between the feet and cold surfaces, such as hardwood floors or chilly bed sheets. This protective barrier helps to shield the feet from heat-conductive materials notorious for absorbing and conducting heat away from the body, thereby leaving the feet colder. Additionally, socks aid in regulating the body's moisture levels, contributing to better overall thermal comfort. When feet become clammy from perspiration, the moisture can feel chilly and uncomfortable. Socks made from moisture-wicking materials, like merino wool, can effectively absorb and transport dampness away from the skin, keeping Craig's feet dry and warm. Since good blood circulation is crucial for maintaining warmth, wearing proper-fitting socks can contribute to an easier flow of blood to the extremities. By preventing tight elastic bands that may constrict blood flow, the right size of socks allows blood to circulate freely, ensuring that vital nutrients and oxygen reach the feet while also transporting heat effectively. As a result, Craig's feet will be healthier and naturally warmer. Furthermore, doubling up on socks, layering, or using heated or thermal socks can provide even greater benefits for individuals like Craig who are prone to cold feet. These specialized socks contain insulating layers, additional padding, or self-heating properties to maximize warmth retention, making them perfect for unusually cold nights or for those who suffer from chronically cold feet. In conclusion, Derrick's suggestion that socks would help alleviate Craig's cold feet at night is well-founded. By providing insulation, preventing heat escape, regulating moisture, and promoting proper blood circulation, socks deliver essential warmth retention and overall foot comfort. To further enhance these benefits, selecting the appropriate sock materials, fitting, and styles is crucial for ensuring that Craig enjoys cozy, warm feet throughout the night."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Unlike the other colonists, who eventually melted into the culture, the Cajuns kept to themselves in the bayou, retaining their 17th-century language and customs. Does it follow that \\"Less than half of the colonists did not melt into the culture just like the Cajuns that kept to themselves in the bayou.\\"?","output":"The statement \\"Less than half of the colonists did not melt into the culture just like the Cajuns that kept to themselves in the bayou\\" might not be entirely correct without additional context about the population and cultural trends of colonists. The original statement focuses solely on the characteristics and distinctiveness of the Cajun community in relation to other colonists. To determine if \\"less than half of the colonists\\" did not integrate into the broader culture, it is essential to examine other colonial communities and their respective levels of cultural assimilation. The Cajuns are a unique group that originated from the Acadian settlers, who were expelled from eastern Canada by the British during the Great Upheaval in the mid-1700s. Thousands of Acadians relocated to southern Louisiana, where the environment and remote location of the bayous enabled them to preserve their cultural identity and traditions, including their language, customs, and way of life.  That being said, it is important to note that colonial America was home to various groups of people originating from different countries, each with its own customs and values. As these communities came together, they were faced with the need to adapt and assimilate in order to coexist alongside one another. Some chose to melt into the broader culture by adopting new traditions, lifestyles, and even languages, while others, like the Cajuns, managed to maintain their unique identity. Therefore, to accurately assess whether \\"less than half of the colonists\\" maintained their distinctiveness and did not melt into the broader culture, we need more information and context about the other colonial communities. Factors such as geographical proximity, population size, political and social encounters, and the level of interaction with other communities would need to be considered. For instance, if most other communities assimilated successfully, then the given statement would not be accurate. However, if there were multiple pockets of colonists across America that retained their original culture like the Cajuns, then the statement could hold true. In conclusion, while it is clear that the Cajuns stand out as a group that preserved their unique language and customs, making an assertion about the cultural assimilation of less than half of all colonists requires a broader understanding of other colonial communities and their respective levels of integration within the broader culture."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Capacitors may retain a charge long after power is removed from a circuit; this charge can cause dangerous or even potentially fatal shocks or damage connected equipment. For example, even a seemingly innocuous device such as a disposable-camera flash unit, powered by a 1.5 volt AA battery, has a capacitor which may contain over 15 joules of energy and be charged to over 300 volts. This is easily capable of delivering a shock. Service procedures for electronic devices usually include instructions to discharge large or high-voltage capacitors, for instance using a Brinkley stick. Capacitors may also have built-in discharge resistors to dissipate stored energy to a safe level within a few seconds after power is removed.

Now more than 10% of net users are visiting websites using the new system, statistics suggest. Called IPv6, the protocol replaces an the older version whose pool of addresses is almost depleted. The figures were gathered by search giant Google, which monitors how people reach its services. The adoption of IPv6 around the world is patchy, as some nations have deployed it widely while others have ignored it. Belgium tops the table of most enthusiastic IPv6 adopters, as 44.3% of people in that country can use it to get at Google and other IPv6 sites. Adoption in the US is 25.6% and the UK 2.95%. The net has grown largely on the back of Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4), which can support a total of four billion addresses. But the massive growth of the net has meant almost all of these older identifiers have now been used up. Everything connected to the net needs an address to ensure that data reaches the right destination. The basic syntax of Internet Protocol version 6 was first agreed 20 years ago, but only in December 2015 did use of it hit 10%, according to Google's figures. Adrian Kennard, head of ISP Andrews and Arnold, said now that IPv4 had run out, many people were taking IPv6 a lot more seriously. \\"Major sites such as Facebook and Google have adopted IPv6, and pretty much any web site could be using IPv6 now,\\" he told the BBC. \\"This means that people that have IPv6 on their devices, as well as IPv4, can now use IPv6 in preference.\\" Mobile networks are among the biggest users of IPv6, because most modern smartphones are equipped for it. The vast majority of people online still connect via IPv4, and some ISPs use technology in their networks to translate between the two. Some are pushing on with projects to convert their networks to IPv6 - in the UK, BT has said its entire network will be able to use IPv6 by the end of 2016. Running both IPv4 and IPv6 had its problems, said Mr Kennard, though few noticed it as the basic tasks of visiting websites were rarely affected by the internal technology. \\"However, sharing IPv4 addresses does stifle innovation and development of new applications and protocols,\\" he said. \\"Eventually IPv4 will be some obscure legacy thing, still lingering on a bit,\\" he added. \\"Sadly, we are probably many years away from that.\\"","output":"The novel scheme being mentioned refers to IPv6 protocol which is designed to help the internet support more users and an increased selection of smart devices and gadgets. This initiative comes as an attempt to counter the depletion of the older protocol, IPv4, which has nearly run out of addresses. According to research data gathered by Google, more than 10% of internet users are now visiting websites using the IPv6 system. IPv6, or Internet Protocol version 6, serves as a replacement for the older IPv4, or Internet Protocol version 4. The primary difference between the two is their capacity for network addresses. IPv4 can support a total of four billion addresses, which may seem vast, but due to the exponential growth of internet use, these addresses are almost entirely occupied. As the internet continues to expand, as does the demand for devices and gadgets connected to the internet. With every device requiring an address to ensure the data it sends or receives gets to the correct destination, a need for a more robust protocol is evident. In December 2015, twenty years after its basic syntax was first agreed upon, usage of IPv6 reached 10% according to Google. This adoption has been patchy with some countries fully embracing it while others have yet to recognize its utility. Belgium notably leads in adoption with approximately 44.3% of its inhabitants capable of using IPv6 to access Google and other IPv6 supported sites. The US follows with a 25.6% adoption rate and the UK trails at 2.95%. In a quote from Adrian Kennard, head of ISP Andrews and Arnold, he notes the increased seriousness with which IPv6 is being taken now that IPv4 addresses have run out. He celebrates the adoption of IPv6 by major sites like Facebook and Google and acknowledges that virtually any website could be using IPv6 at this point. This shift allows individuals with IPv6 on their devices to preferentially use it over IPv4 when connecting to the internet. He also points out that mobile networks are among the largest user groups of IPv6 due to the equipping of modern smartphones for the protocol. Nevertheless, despite the shifting trend, a large portion of individuals online still connect via IPv4. Some Internet Service Providers (ISPs) use technology in their networks to translate between the outdated IPv4 and the newer IPv6. Prioritizing projects to convert networks to IPv6 is ongoing, as demonstrated by BT in the UK which announced an intention for its entire network to use IPv6 by the end of 2016. Running both IPv4 and IPv6 concurrently has its disadvantages as noted by Mr. Kennard, as the sharing of IPv4 addresses hinders the innovation and development of new applications and protocols. Nevertheless, this is often unnoticed by the majority of users as it rarely impacts the basic tasks such as website visits. According to Kennard, eventually, IPv4 will become a \\"lingering\\" obscure legacy, although he concedes that this is likely many years away."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A drifter and handyman, a black man by the name of Moses, appears at her door one night, asking for work. He offers to plant cotton on all her acres and cites his experience. Edna declines to hire him but offers him a meal instead and sends him on his way. In desperation, Moses steals some of her silver spoons before he leaves. Similarly desperate, Edna finally resolves to keep her family together on the farm no matter what.

As someone who works at the court, Benjamin was highly familiar with the legal system and was aware of the various intricacies associated with representing oneself in a civil lawsuit. He recognized the importance of having a thorough understanding of the court's rules, procedures, and required etiquette for someone in Leslie's position. To begin with, Benjamin provided Leslie with a detailed overview of the court's expectations regarding decorum and proper conduct during the trial. He emphasized the need for punctuality, proper attire, and maintaining a respectful demeanor throughout the proceedings. Benjamin also explained the importance of addressing the judge as 'Your Honor' and standing up when addressing the court or responding to questions. Moving on to the procedural aspects, Benjamin outlined the various stages of a civil trial. He explained the process of filing a complaint, serving it on the defendant, and waiting for the defendant to submit their answer. He also described how the parties would exchange information through the process of discovery, including interrogatories, requests for production, and depositions. Drawing further on his experience, Benjamin shared valuable insights related to the pre-trial phase. He advised Leslie on the necessity of filing pre-trial motions, which could help streamline the proceedings and potentially lead to a favorable outcome. Motions such as summary judgment, requesting a change of venue, or even asking the court to dismiss the case entirely were all strategies that Leslie needed to keep in mind. With regards to presenting evidence during the trial, Benjamin highlighted that Leslie should be prepared to submit witness testimonies, documents, and other relevant evidence to effectively support his case. He also stressed the importance of being able to cross-examine the defendant's witnesses, as well as knowing how to object to inadmissible evidence or improper questioning. Additionally, Benjamin educated Leslie on how to make a compelling opening statement and persuasive closing argument, offering tips on structuring the content and utilizing effective communication techniques.

Finally, Benjamin touched upon essential post-trial matters, such as filing an appeal if the outcome was unfavorable or collecting the judgment in the event of success. He explained that understanding the appellate process and the grounds for filing an appeal was crucial, as even the smallest error in procedure could potentially nullify the results of a hard-won trial. Overall, Benjamin's comprehensive guidance on the rules and procedures of civil court enabled Leslie to confidently represent himself in the legal arena.

Given those answer options, answer the question: U.S. President Donald Trump says he may veto a 1.3 trillion spending bill because it does not offer protections for young undocumented immigrants who arrived as children and does not fully fund the border wall. In a Twitter post Friday morning, Trump said he is considering a veto of the omnibus spending bill based on \\"the fact that the 800,000 plus DACA recipients have been totally abandoned by the Democrats (not even mentioned in Bill) and the BORDER WALL, which is desperately needed for our National Defense, is not fully funded.\\" Previously, White House officials said Trump would sign the spending package, a move that would head off a potential government shutdown due to a lack of funding. The measure funds the federal government through September 30. If Trump does not sign the legislation into law, the federal government will shut down at 12:01 a.m. Saturday. The Senate passed the bill by a 65-32 vote early Friday morning after the House of Representatives approved the measure Thursday. Lawmakers had just hours to read the nearly 2,200-page bill released Wednesday night.  With midterm elections looming in November, the bill likely marks the final time Capitol Hill considers major legislation this year. The measure fulfills Trump’s vow to boost military funding but provides funding for limited parts of his immigration agenda. The bill includes a 2.4 percent pay raise for military personnel. After extensive negotiations between Republicans and Democrats, the bill also provides 1.6 billion for physical barriers and 150 kilometers of a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border, short of the 25 billion Trump requested for the project he repeatedly touted on the campaign trail while pledging Mexico would pick up the cost.

She was unbelievably grateful to have the annoying man out of her life for good Answer the following question: Why did the speaker cry when the man boarded the plane and left for Oregon ?","output":"The speaker cried when the man boarded the plane and left for Oregon primarily because of the complex emotions she was experiencing at that moment. She did not want him to go and felt torn apart between sadness and hope for the future, which in turn caused her to shed tears. On one hand, the speaker was upset because she had deep feelings for the man and desired to become his girlfriend and potentially his wife. His departure meant that they would be geographically separated, which undoubtedly would impact their relationship. The physical distance can create emotional distance, leaving the speaker feeling uncertain and anxious about the future of their connection. On the other hand, the man had given her hope by promising her a chance to be with him, which she desired the most. This promise represented a glimmer of hope for their relationship despite the physical separation. It is this hope that made her feel torn as she felt that their love story might still have a chance to blossom. These tears, therefore, were a culmination of sadness, hope, and anxiety that the speaker experienced while the man she cared for deeply was leaving for Oregon. Her heartache was magnified when it turned out that upon arriving in Oregon, instead of keeping his promise to her, the man got back together with his previous girlfriend. This betrayal added another level of pain to her tears, as she felt devalued and pushed away by someone she deeply cared for."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: John lives in a farhouse well away from anyone.

Step 1: The kidneys receive blood through the renal artery - More blood flow to the kidneys is necessary for proper filtration.

Blood pressure is vital to push blood through the nephrons effectively. Step 3: The kidneys filter the waste from the blood - If there is not enough water pressure, this may reduce the rate at which waste is filtered from the blood. Step 4: The clean blood is circulated out of the kidneys - The less effectively waste is filtered, the lesser clean blood is returned to circulation. Step 5: Excess water and waste is expelled from the kidneys in the form of urine - Reduced water pressure may result in less waste and excess water being expelled from the kidneys in the form of urine.

Plot title: Wonder Boys Movie plot: Professor Grady Tripp (Michael Douglas) is a novelist who teaches creative writing at an unnamed Pittsburgh university (the movie was shot chiefly in and around Carnegie Mellon). He is having an affair with the university chancellor, Sara Gaskell (Frances McDormand), whose husband, Walter (Richard Thomas), is the chairman of the English department in which Grady is a professor. Grady's third wife, Emily, has just left him, and he has failed to repeat the grand success of his first novel, published years earlier. He continues to labor on a second novel, but the more he tries to finish it the less able he finds himself to invent a satisfactory ending. The book runs to over two and a half thousand pages and is still far from finished. He spends his free time smoking marijuana. Grady's students include James Leer (Tobey Maguire) and Hannah Green (Katie Holmes). Hannah and James are friends and both very good writers. Hannah, who rents a room in Grady's large house, is attracted to Grady, but he does not reciprocate. James is enigmatic, quiet, dark and enjoys writing fiction more than he first lets on. During a party at the Gaskells' house, Sara reveals to Grady that she is pregnant with his child. Grady finds James standing outside holding what he claims to be a replica gun, won by his mother at a fairground during her schooldays. However, the gun turns out to be very real, as James shoots the Gaskells' dog when he finds it attacking Grady. James also steals a very valuable piece of Marilyn Monroe memorabilia from the house. Grady is unable to tell Sara of this incident as she is pressuring him to choose between her and Emily. As a result, Grady is forced to keep the dead dog in the trunk of his car for most of the weekend. He also allows James to follow him around, fearing that he may be depressed or even suicidal.

Way before the 'Scary Movie' series there were a few examples of this genre, mostly in the 80s. But like said franchise most of these films are hit or miss. Some like 'Elvira, Mistress of the Dark' mostly rise above that, but other like 'Saturday the 14th' and it's sequel fail to deliver the laughs. But out of all these types of films there is one particularly big offender and that's 'Transylvania 6-5000,' a major waste of time for many reasons. Pros: A great cast that does it's best. Some of the dopey humor is amusing. A corny, but catch theme song. Some good Transylvanian locations. Cons: Threadbare plot. Mostly tedious pacing. Most of the humor just doesn't cut it. The monsters are given little to do and little screen time. I thought this was supposed to be a spoof of monster movies? Lame ending that will likely make viewers angry. Final thoughts: This is a comedy? If it is then why are the really funny bits so few and far in between? Comedies are supposed to make us roll on the floor, not roll our eyes and yawn, aching for it to be over. I can't believe Anchor Bay released this tired junk. I'll admit it's not one of the worst films ever made, but it's not worth anyone's time or money even if you're a fan of any of the actors. See 'Transylvania Twist' instead.

What was going on in that conversation?","output":"In the conversation, Rory, Ed, and Greg are trying to fix an electrical device with a broken cord. They discuss how to address the issue and seek help from each other. At the beginning of the conversation, Rory asks for help in fixing the device, but they have already begun the process of opening and inspecting the device because the faceplate has been removed, as mentioned by Rory. Ed asks if the problem is related to the cord, and Rory confirms that the cord is broken, possibly as a result of being tied. Ed believes the cord should be easy to replace but admits he doesn't know much about electrical work. He suggests that they might want to ask Nedd, who appears to have expertise in this area, for assistance or maybe attempt to fix it themselves if it's a simple matter of retying the cord. Rory mentions that they have found the mechanism within the device but it looks complicated, and they are unsure how to proceed with fixing it. Ed acknowledges and offers assistance, but Rory decides the repair can wait until the next day. Finally, Greg intervenes and asks Ed to call the CPS (possibly a property management company, as they are responsible for the property), and it seems they plan to delegate the repair responsibility to them. Overall, the conversation revolves around the three friends trying to collectively address an issue with an element of an electrical device and their uncertainty on how to repair it. They weigh their options and contemplate seeking help from another individual or the relevant authorities, eventually deciding to contact the property management for assistance."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: I can use this background: Centripetal force is, simply, the force that causes centripetal acceleration. Objects that move in uniform circular motion all have an acceleration toward the center of the circle and therefore, they must also suffer a force toward the center of the circle. That force is the centripetal force. For orbiting satellites, such as the moon orbiting the earth or the earth orbiting the sun, the centripetal force is produced by gravity. When an Olympic hammer thrower whirls a massive ball on a chain, the centripetal force is created by the athlete and transmitted by the chain.  Now, I have a new situation: Adam wants to show his little brother a trick.  He gets a bucket of water and says to him \\"I bet i can turn this bucket upside down and no water will fall out\\". His brother doesn't believe him of course. So Adam takes the bucket by the handle and quickly starts spinning it in a circle.  Answer this question please: Will the centripetal force on the bucket increase or decrease as Adam spins it faster? Answer:","output":"As Adam spins the bucket faster, the centripetal force on the bucket will increase. This is because centripetal force is directly proportional to the square of the speed of the object (in this case, the bucket) as it moves in a circular path. As Adam increases the speed of the spinning bucket, the centripetal force acting on it will also increase, keeping the water inside the bucket due to the force pushing the water towards the bottom of the bucket, even when it is upside down."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Ku Klux Klan is the oldest and most well-known hate group in the United States. At one point, during its heyday, the Klan boasted a membership of around 4 million. That number has greatly dwindled, with the Southern Poverty and Law Center putting current numbers between 8,000 and 10,000. Despite their fewer numbers, the KKK has seen some recent exposure in mainstream society, most notably during this campaign season. In February, former Knights of the Ku Klux Klan grand wizard, and politician, David Duke expressed support for Donald Trump, telling listeners of his radio show they would “meet people who are going to have the same kind of mindset that you have” if they went to one of his rallies and that “voting against Donald Trump at this point is really treason to your heritage.” Trump came under heavy criticism for not immediately and consistently disavowing Duke. When CNN’s Jake Tapper asked Trump if he would disavow Duke, his response was, “I don’t know anything about what you’re even talking about with white supremacy or white supremacists….So I don’t know. I don’t know — did he endorse me, or what’s going on? Because I know nothing about David Duke; I know nothing about white supremacists.” A few days later, Trump did reject Duke’s support, telling NBC: “I don’t mind disavowing anybody, and I disavowed David Duke. And I disavowed him the day before at a major news conference…. I have no problem disavowing groups, but I’d at least like to know who they are. It would be very unfair to disavow a group if the group shouldn’t be disavowed. I have to know who the groups are. But I disavowed David Duke.” Photographer Peter van Agtmael, on assignment for a European magazine, in 2015, headed to Tennessee and Maryland, where he spent time with some members of today’s KKK. His pictures offer us a glimpse into a world that despite having been around for a long time in the United States, is still rarely seen by most Americans.

Machining of copper is possible, although it is usually necessary to use an alloy for intricate parts to get good machinability characteristics.\\"? Answer:","output":"Based on the passage provided, please answer the following question: What are the major applications of copper and its distribution in various industries, and how is it utilized both as a pure metal and in combination with other elements? The passage highlights the major applications of copper and its distribution across different industries. Copper is extensively used in electrical wires, which accounts for 60% of its total usage. This is primarily due to copper's high electrical conductivity, which makes it an ideal material for transmitting electricity. The second major application of copper is in roofing and plumbing, using up 20% of the copper supply. Copper's corrosion resistance and malleability make it suitable for these purposes, as it can be easily shaped and bent without breaking. Industrial machinery is another significant consumer of copper, representing 15% of its usage. In this application, copper is mainly used as a pure metal; however, when higher hardness is required, it is often combined with other elements to form an alloy. Only 5% of copper's total usage goes towards alloy production, with the most common alloys being brass and bronze. These alloys exhibit enhanced mechanical properties compared to pure copper, and they are often used for components that require increased strength, stiffness, and wear resistance. Besides its role as a structural material, copper is also employed in the production of compounds for nutritional supplements and fungicides in agriculture. Although this application constitutes a relatively small part of the copper supply, it demonstrates the metal's versatility and importance in various industries. Machining copper is possible, although using an alloy is generally necessary for creating intricate parts. This is because alloys offer better machinability characteristics compared to pure copper, allowing for more precise and complex designs. In summary, the major applications of copper can be categorized into electrical wires (60%), roofing and plumbing (20%), industrial machinery (15%), and alloy production (5%). Copper is primarily used as a pure metal, but alloys such as brass and bronze are employed when increased mechanical properties are needed. Additionally, copper plays a role in the manufacture of compounds for nutritional supplements and fungicides in agriculture, further showcasing its widespread utility."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: Abstract Background and Purpose Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is common in survivors of acute life-threatening illness, but little is known about the burden of PTSD in survivors of stroke and transient ischemic attack (TIA). This study estimated the prevalence of stroke or TIA-induced posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) using systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods Potentially relevant peer-reviewed journal articles were identified by searching the Ovid MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PILOTS Database, The Cochrane Library and Scopus from inception to January 2013; all searches were conducted on January 31, 2013. Observational cohort studies that assessed PTSD with specific reference to a stroke or TIA that occurred at least 1 month prior to the PTSD assessment were included. PTSD rates and characteristics of the study and sample were abstracted from all included studies. The coding of all articles included demographics, sample size, study country, and method and timing of PTSD assessment. Results Nine studies (N = 1,138) met our inclusion criteria. PTSD rates varied significantly across studies by timing of PTSD assessment (i.e., within 1 year of stroke/TIA versus greater than 1 year post-stroke/TIA; 55% of heterogeneity explained; Q 1 = 10.30; P = .001). Using a random effects model, the estimated rate of PTSD following stroke or TIA was 23% (95% CI, 16%–33%) within 1 year of the stroke or TIA and 11% (95% CI, 8%–14%) after 1 year. Conclusions Although PTSD is commonly thought to be triggered by external events such as combat or sexual assault, these results suggest that 1 in 4 stroke or TIA survivors develop significant PTSD symptoms due to the stroke or TIA. Screening for PTSD in a large population-based prospective cohort study with cardiovascular outcome assessments is needed to yield definitive prevalence, and determine whether stroke or TIA-induced PTSD is a risk factor for subsequent cardiovascular events or mortality.

Introduction Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is an anxiety disorder initiated by exposure to a traumatic event and is characterized by symptoms of re-experiencing, avoidance of reminders of the event, persistent negative mood and cognition, and physiological hyperarousal that persist for at least 1 month after the event. Observational evidence suggests that PTSD is related to increased risk of incident cardiovascular disease [1] [2]. A recent meta-analysis further suggests that PTSD triggered by cardiovascular events - specifically, acute coronary syndrome (ACS) - is associated with a doubling of risk for recurrent cardiac events and mortality [3] [4]. Until recently, only a few studies assessed PTSD due to stroke, another potentially traumatic acute cardiovascular event. Prevalence estimates in these studies has varied from 3–37% [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12]. A more recent study, the largest on this topic to date, found that 18% of 535 stroke or TIA survivors reported clinically significant PTSD symptoms. While the association between stroke or TIA-induced PTSD and risk for recurrent stroke or other cardiovascular events was not examined, participants in this study were nearly three times more likely than those without PTSD symptoms to report medication nonadherence [13]. These data suggest that, similar to ACS-induced PTSD, stroke or TIA-induced PTSD may increase risk for recurrent stroke and other cardiovascular events. This meta-analytic review of cross-sectional studies was designed to estimate the overall prevalence of PTSD due to stroke or TIA.      Methods Search Strategy and Selection Criteria We sought to identify all studies that reported a valid prevalence estimate of PTSD due to stroke or TIA. Included studies must have been observational cohorts and must have assessed PTSD with specific reference to a stroke or TIA that occurred at least 1 month prior to the PTSD assessment. Further, studies must have used a self-report PTSD screening instrument or clinical interview designed or specifically altered to query about only stroke or TIA-induced PTSD. For the one study that reported multiple PTSD assessments, we abstracted only the earliest estimate (at 1 month post-stroke) [10]. Potentially relevant peer-reviewed journal articles published in English were identified by a search of the biomedical electronic databases Ovid MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PILOTS Database, The Cochrane Library and Scopus conducted by an information specialist (L.F.) with expertise in behavioral medicine. Databases were searched from inception to January 2013; all searches were conducted on January 31, 2013. All relevant subject headings and free-text terms were used to represent PTSD and stroke or TIA and the sets of terms were combined with AND. Terms for MEDLINE included: exp Stress Disorders, Traumatic/OR ptsd.tw. OR (post-traumatic OR (post adj traumatic)).tw or posttraumatic.tw. AND exp stroke/OR Stroke.tw OR cerebrovascular.tw. OR ((brain or vascular or lacunar or venous or cerebral or isch?emic) adj2 (accident or infarct or event or attack)).tw. Search terms were adapted for the other databases. Additional records were identified by scanning the reference lists of relevant studies and reviews and by employing the Related Articles feature in PubMed/Medline and the Cited Reference Search in Scopus. To determine the studies to be assessed further, two authors (S.R., D.E.) independently read the title, or title and abstract of every record retrieved. Opinion differences were resolved by consensus. All potentially relevant articles were investigated as full text. Database Construction and Coding We abstracted PTSD rates and characteristics of the study and sample from all included studies (Table 1). The coding of all articles included demographic information, sample size, study country, and method and timing of PTSD assessment. We also evaluated the quality of each study based on the Methodological Evaluation of Observational Research (MORE)- Observational Studies of Incidence or Prevalence of Chronic Diseases developed by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) [14]. One study’s prevalence estimate, 7 and another’s demographic characteristics were uncertain [9], so authors were contacted to obtain this information. We converted one study’s prevalence estimate to make it consistent with the method used by the other studies that estimated prevalence using a screening questionnaire [13]. All studies that were included used either diagnostic interviews or well-validated self-report screening questionnaires that assessed PTSD specifically due to stroke or TIA.

Characteristics of Studies on the Prevalence of Stroke-Induced PTSD. doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0066435.t001 Quantitative Methods Comprehensive Meta-analysis (version 2, BioStat Software, Engelwood, NJ) served as the statistical platform for completing all statistical tests and associated graphic results. To summarize the prevalence findings, we computed prevalence point estimates using these formulas: Logit Event Rate = Log [Event Rate/(1 �?� Event Rate)]. Event Rate Standard Error = �?�(1/(Event Rate ·Sample Size)/(1/[(1�?�Event Rate) · Sample Size]), We computed 95% confidence intervals (CIs) using this formula: Lower Limit = Logit Event Rate �?� (1.96 · Logit Event Rate Standard Error). Upper Limit = Logit Event Rate+(1.96 · Logit Event Rate Standard Error). Results are presented after back-transformation. There was statistically significant heterogeneity in prevalence estimates, so random-effects models were used. In addition, we used sensitivity analyses to assess evidence of moderator effects for the prevalence results across two methodological factors: (1) method and (2) timing of PTSD assessment. Finally, we produced a forest plot and calculated both the classic and Orwin’s fail-safe N to address the issue of publication bias.      Discussion To our knowledge, this is the first meta-analytic review of stroke or TIA-induced PTSD. We found an overall prevalence of 13% among stroke/TIA survivors, with 23% prevalence in the first year post-stroke and 11% after the first year. Given that about 85% of the 795,000 patients who experience a stroke each year in the US [15] survive at least 30 days [16], and up to an additional 500,000 suffer from a TIA [17], these results suggest that 297,850 stroke and TIA survivors in the United States alone will develop PTSD symptoms due to the event annually. Within 90 days of the index stroke, 6% of survivors experience a recurrent stroke [18], and recurrence rates increase substantially over longer term follow up [19]. We do not yet know if stroke or TIA-induced PTSD is associated with increased risk for a recurrent cerebrovascular attack, but given the doubling of ACS recurrence risk due to ACS-induced PTSD [3] and recent research showing that PTSD is strongly associated with medication nonadherence [13], such research is sorely needed. Important caveats to this review include the fact that only studies with relatively small sample sizes have addressed stroke-induced PTSD, and one of the studies represented half of all of the participants included in this review. Also, none of the included studies used population-based sampling, and all but one study [10] relied on cross-sectional designs (and we used only the earliest point estimate, 1 month after stroke). Further, the PTSD screening questionnaires used in many of the studies have not been validated against clinical diagnosis of PTSD in survivors of stroke/TIA, though they perform very well in other patient populations. Thus, although this meta-analysis was able to quantify more precisely the prevalence of stroke-induced PTSD symptoms, a clear need for additional research remains. It is also important to note that we were very strict in our inclusion of only studies that measured PTSD specifically due to the stroke event, so these estimates may represent an underestimate of the total burden of PTSD symptoms in these participants in so much as PTSD due to other types of events may have been present. The estimated prevalence of stroke-induced PTSD was lower when PTSD was assessed by clinical interview. This may be due to the fact that the prevalence of psychiatric disorders is often higher when measured using diagnostic instruments as compared to clinical psychiatric interviews Nevertheless, research on the association between ACS-induced PTSD and ACS recurrence and mortality risk suggests that even elevated symptoms of PTSD, not clinical diagnosis, is associated with increased risk. Hence, the estimate of the prevalence of PTSD symptoms based on diagnostic instruments may still be clinically relevant [3]. Study Limitations Prevalence estimates were limited to patients who could participate in PTSD assessments and hence should be extrapolated to patients with severe cognitive impairment or aphasia with caution. Similarly, these results should be interpreted with awareness that the mean age of the participants was slightly low relative to the entire population of stroke survivors and PTSD is associated with younger age in ACS-induced PTSD [3], and therefore our rate estimate may not generalize to older stroke survivors. We were unable to determine whether the prevalence of PTSD differed if due to TIA or stroke, as the only study to include TIA survivors [13] did not record the proportion of participants who experienced either condition. Moreover, none of the studies reported on the severity of the stroke event in terms of the types of critical care that may have been necessitated such as intensive care unit (ICU) admission. Only one of the studies included in this review evaluated for stroke lesion localization [6], suggesting the need to further examine whether stroke location (i.e. hemisphere, etc) or the nature of the associated deficits (i.e. paresis/paralysis, aphasia, anosagnosia) further differentiate PTSD risk. Such knowledge would allow clinicians to identify those at higher risk for PTSD to implement early intervention. Similarly, we opted to retain one study that focused on PTSD due to subarachnoid hemorrhage, which clinicians and epidemiologists view as a distinct condition from stroke/TIA, because of the similarities in patient experience and because the aggregate estimate was not sensitive to its exclusion. Future research should determine whether PTSD due to subarachnoid hemorrhage is rightly grouped with PTSD due to stroke/TIA. It is also important to note the difference in prevalence estimates reported in studies that assessed PTSD by screening questionnaire versus clinical interview. Although screening questionnaires are often used to identify patients who should be further assessed for PTSD diagnosis–and therefore may overestimate prevalence–reliance on screening questionnaires for estimates of stroke-induced PTSD prevalence may further inflate those estimates due to overlap in symptoms of stroke and PTSD. Very little is known about the validity of PTSD questionnaire items in stroke survivors, but the evidence that exists suggests that PTSD questionnaires are valid in this population. In one study, confirmatory factor analysis of responses to the PTSD Checklist-specific for stroke conformed to the established factor structure for PTSD due to other types of events [13]. In another small study, PTSD severity was not related to either lesion site or neurologic and memory deficits that could be expected to inflate PTSD symptoms were the scale not valid [6]. Further research on the influence of neurologic and cognitive deficits on PTSD symptom expression is sorely needed. Finally, future research should also consider concomitance with other comorbid stroke factors including depression, however, it is important to note that the effect of ACS-induced PTSD on ACS recurrence and mortality is independent of depression [3]. Conclusions Across published studies estimating the prevalence of stroke-induced PTSD, two general conclusions can be drawn: (1) stroke-induced PTSD is relatively common, with approximately one in four experiencing PTSD in the first year after stroke and one in nine experiencing chronic PTSD over a year later, and (2) based on a single study, stroke-induced PTSD symptoms appear to influence important secondary prevention behaviors such as medication adherence [13], independent of depression. Though no data now exist to address the issue, if the risk of stroke or other cardiovascular event recurrence associated with stroke-induced PTSD is comparable to that found for PTSD after ACS, stroke-induced PTSD may be a significant, novel risk factor for recurrent stroke, especially given its high prevalence after stroke. Screening for PTSD in a large, population-based prospective cohort study would yield definitive prevalence and secondary risk estimates, and should be a priority for researchers. In the meantime, clinicians should be mindful that PTSD can be a devastating mental health condition and should consider screening for PTSD in stroke survivors. ||||| Post-traumatic stress disorder, known as PTSD, is not just a problem for military veterans, sexual assault survivors and other crime victims — it also plagues many stroke victims, according to new research.      The study, published online Wednesday in the journal PLOS One, reports that 23% of stroke and mini-stroke victims surveyed within one year of the event suffered from PTSD. In addition, 11% of stroke victims surveyed more than a year after the event reported that they experienced PTSD.      A stroke occurs when an artery carrying essential oxygen and nutrients to the brain is blocked or bursts, causing damage to the brain and potentially impairing speech, sight and motor control. A mini-stroke, also known as a transient ischemic attack, occurs in a similar way but lasts only a few minutes.      Strokes kill about 137,000 people per year in the United States and in 2010 led to 73.7 billion in healthcare costs.      The new research developed from a growing awareness that medical traumas can lead to PTSD. Study leader Donald Edmondson, an assistant professor at Columbia University, previously established that PTSD is common among heart attack survivors and that it is linked to an increased risk of later developing heart disease. This led his team to question how often stroke victims develop PTSD.      “For something especially acute and scary like a stroke, we wondered: Why couldn’t that be a trigger for PTSD?” said Dr. Ian Kronish, a general internist at Columbia and part of the research team.      PTSD is an anxiety disorder affecting about 7.7 million American adults. It is characterized by a traumatic event that leads to three families of symptoms: flashbacks and nightmares, avoidance of anything that triggers memories of the event, and hyper-vigilance.      Scouring medical publications, the team compiled as much information as they could about PTSD prevalence in stroke victims. They found nine completed studies that met their criteria. In seven of the studies, participants were diagnosed with PTSD through a screening questionnaire, while interviews with a clinician were used for diagnosis in the other two studies.      The data from the nine studies were combined for a total of 1,138 participants, all from the U.S. or Europe. All participants were assessed for PTSD between one and 60 months after the stroke.      PTSD appeared more commonly within a year of the stroke (23% of participants) than a year or more out (11%). Kronish was surprised by the findings.      “1 in 4 is a big number,” Kronish said about the studies examining PTSD within one year. “Until doing this research, I hadn’t really thought of PTSD being due to a medical event.”      One limitation of the study was that in several cases, participants were assessed for PTSD using questionnaires that had not been cross-validated with clinical interviews among stroke victims.      Future research aims to further examine the link between stroke and PTSD by following the same group of participants over time in order to specifically address whether the disorder increases the risk of additional strokes and heart disease.      Future research will also examine how mental health intervention may reduce symptoms specifically in stroke victims.      The study is available at the PLOS One website.

An MRI scan of the brain can show a stroke. (Photo: Photo Disc) Story Highlights PTSD may hinder recovery after a stroke or mini-stroke      Stroke is the fourth-leading cause of death in the USA      Stroke is a leading cause of serious long-term disability      A stroke may leave some survivors with post-traumatic stress disorder, which may hinder their recovery, according to a study released today.      About 23% of patients who survive a stroke or transient ischemic attack, a brief interruption of blood flow to the brain, have PTSD symptoms within a year, the study finds. About 11% have chronic PTSD, in which symptoms last three months or longer, more than a year later. The study, led by Columbia University Medical Center researchers, was published online today in the journal PLOS ONE.      \\"Strokes are among the most terrifying life-threatening events,\\" says lead author Donald Edmondson.      People think about PTSD in relation to external events like war or sexual assault, says Edmondson, assistant professor of behavioral medicine at Columbia's Center for Behavioral Cardiovascular Health. \\"There is something different about PTSD after a stroke because the threat is inside your body,\\" he adds.      The analysis looked at nine studies of PTSD induced by a stroke or TIA, sometimes called a mini-stroke. The studies included 1,138 stroke or TIA survivors in France, Norway, Switzerland, United Kingdom and the United States. The average age of participants was 64.5 and 47.5% were men.      PTSD can develop after an event involving physical harm or the threat of physical harm, according to the National Institute of Mental Health. Symptoms include having nightmares, avoiding reminders of the event and feeling tense. Treatments are psychotherapy, medications or a combination.      Stroke is the fourth-leading cause of death in the USA, according to the American Stroke Association. It is a leading cause of serious long-term disability.      Ralph Sacco, an American Heart Association spokesman who was not involved in the study, says Edmondson's research looks at an under-recognized condition. \\"This is one of the first studies that investigates what's in the literature about PTSD after a stroke or TIA,\\" he adds. \\"We often think of PTSD as coming on after other kinds of stressful events — wars or other emotional events.      \\"A stroke or TIA can be an emotionally charged event — some strokes can be life-threatening or potentially disabling,\\" says Sacco, chairman of neurology at the Miller School of Medicine at the University of Miami.      Edmondson says, \\"Our current results show that PTSD in stroke and TIA survivors may increase their risk for recurrent stroke and other cardiovascular events.\\"      The concern is that PTSD may threaten recovery. Previous research has shown that PTSD is associated with patients not adhering to their schedule for taking medications.      Sacco recommends that stroke patients who suspect that they have PTSD symptoms get medical attention.      Edmondson says there are good PTSD treatments. \\"But first, physicians and patients have to be aware that this is a problem,\\" he says. \\"Family members can also help. We know that social support is a good protective factor against PTSD due to any type of traumatic event.\\"      He adds, \\"The next step is further research to assess whether mental health treatment can reduce stroke- or TIA-induced PTSD symptoms and help these patients regain a feeling of normalcy and calm as soon as possible after their health scare.\\"      Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/11ZwnAv |||||","output":"The study titled \\"Prevalence of PTSD in Survivors of Stroke and Transient Ischemic Attack: A Meta-Analytic Review\\" by Edmondson et al., published in PLoS ONE in 2013, explores the prevalence of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) in survivors of stroke or Transient Ischemic Attack (TIA). PTSD is commonly linked to traumatic events like combat or sexual assault, but this study investigates the mental health disorder's prevalence in survivors of acute life-threatening illnesses such as stroke and TIA. The researchers conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis drawing from nine studies, involving a total of 1,138 subjects, that met their rigorous inclusion criteria. The coding for each included study incorporated aspects such as demographics, sample size, and methodology of PTSD assessment. Their estimates reveal that PTSD affected 23% of stroke or TIA survivors within one year of the event and 11% after one year. This suggests one in four stroke or TIA survivors could potentially exhibit considerable PTSD symptoms due to their health scare. The findings underscore that PTSD can be triggered by internal medical events, not only external traumatic events, contributing to our understanding of this mental health disorder. The results also hint that stroke or TIA-induced PTSD might be a risk factor for future cardiovascular events or mortality, although this warrants further investigation. Nonetheless, the study acknowledges certain limitations. For instance, the PTSD assessment questionnaires used in several of the studies haven't been cross-validated with clinical interviews among stroke victims. Moreover, the research was constricted to patients who could participate in PTSD assessments and may not be generalizable to patients with severe cognitive impairment or aphasia.      Further research in this area will examine whether stroke or TIA-induced PTSD is associated with increased risk for recurring strokes or heart disease, as well as investigate how interventions could potentially decrease PTSD symptoms specifically in stroke survivors. Despite the limitations, the study gives researchers and clinicians insight into an underrecognized but common occurrence of PTSD in stroke or TIA survivors. Therefore, the authors recommend clinicians remain vigilant about potential PTSD in stroke survivors, considering it as they plan for patient care following stroke or TIA."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A team of Allied prisoners of war (POWs), coached and led by English Captain John Colby (Michael Caine), a professional footballer for West Ham United before the war, agree to play an exhibition match against a German team, only to find themselves involved in a German propaganda stunt. Colby is the captain and essentially the manager of the team and thus chooses his squad of players. Another POW, US Army Capt. Robert Hatch (Sylvester Stallone), on enlisted TDY to the Canadian Army, is not initially chosen, but eventually nags the reluctant Colby into letting him on the team as the team's trainer, as Hatch needs to be with the team to facilitate his upcoming escape attempt. Colby's superior officers repeatedly try to convince Colby to use the match as an opportunity for an escape attempt, but Colby consistently refuses, fearing that such an attempt will only result in getting his players killed. Meanwhile, Hatch has been planning his unrelated escape attempt, and Colby's superiors agree to help him, if he in return agrees to journey to Paris, make contact with the French Resistance, and try to convince them to help the football team escape. Hatch succeeds in escaping the prison camp, travelling to Paris, and finding the Resistance; at first, the Resistance decides that the plan to help the football team escape is too risky, but once they realise the game will be at the Colombes Stadium they plan the escape using a tunnel from the Paris sewer system to the showers in the players' changing room. They convince Hatch to let himself be recaptured, so he can pass information along back to the leading British officers at the prison camp. Hatch is indeed recaptured, but upon his recapture, he is put in solitary confinement.

My question: where hit man meets? The answer to this question is:","output":"In the Mulholland Drive plot, the hitman, played by Mark Pellegrino, meets his associate Joe Messing (Dan Hedaya) at a run-down building. They discuss a hit that the hitman needs to carry out involving a woman, who is later revealed to be the brunette woman, Rita (Laura Harring). The hitman's storyline runs parallel to the main plot, as he carries out various tasks, including the assassination of a business rival. As the story unfolds, the hitman's activities become increasingly intertwined with the lives of Betty (Naomi Watts) and Rita, ultimately contributing to the film's conclusion. In David Lynch's surrealistic and dreamlike style, the hitman's purpose and actions, like the rest of the movie, can be open to multiple interpretations."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

That's what happened during a live radio show with Miley Cyrus's team. Let me explain what happened. Once upon a time, there was a famous singer named Miley Cyrus. She had many fans who loved her songs and performances. One day, Miley and her team of friends (also known as her \\"people\\") were talking to a DJ on a live radio show. A DJ is a person who plays music and talks with people on the radio. Everything was going well, and they were all having a good time. But then, the DJ started asking questions that were making Miley's team uncomfortable. Sometimes, people ask questions that are too personal or not very nice, and it can make others feel uneasy or upset. So, Miley's people decided to do something about it. They chose to \\"pull the plug\\" on the DJ. This doesn't mean they literally pulled a plug out of a wall, but it's a way to say they stopped the conversation with the DJ. They did this because they thought it was the best way to protect Miley and her feelings. The listeners of the radio show were surprised when the chat with Miley's team suddenly ended. It was a big deal because it doesn't usually happen on live radio. But, it's important to remember that everyone has a right to feel safe and comfortable, even if they're famous like Miley Cyrus. So, the next time you listen to the radio, remember this story and how important it is to be kind and considerate when asking questions. And always, be a good friend like Miley's people, who will stand up for her when she needs it most."},{"instruction":"I am verifying the answers generated by an automatic system to the following question: what do pigs eat Suggested answer: Pigs are omnivores and are highly social and intelligent animals.

Would \\"When the 42nd U.S. Congress convened on March 4, 1871, Senators affiliated with President Grant, known as ‘’New Radicals’’ voted to oust Sen. Sumner from the Senate Foreign Relations Committee chairmanship.\\" be a reasonable answer? Answer:","output":"No, the provided statement would not be a reasonable answer to the question, as it focuses on a later event in 1871 which does not directly address how the 'Bleeding Sumner' incident led to the Civil War. A more accurate and detailed response is provided below. The \\"Bleeding Sumner\\" incident refers to the violent attack on Sen. Charles Sumner by Rep. Preston Brooks in the U.S. Senate in May 1856. This event contributed to rising tensions between the North and South, ultimately leading to the Civil War. To understand how it played a role in the path to the Civil War, it is crucial to look at the broader context of this incident. The conflict between Sen. Sumner and Rep. Brooks stemmed from a speech Sumner gave on May 19-20, 1856, called \\"The Crime Against Kansas.\\" In the speech, Sumner criticized the Kansas-Nebraska Act, which allowed the territories to decide if they would be admitted as free or slave states based on popular sovereignty. As a strong abolitionist, Sumner condemned slavery and criticized those who supported it or sought its expansion. Specifically, Sumner targeted two of his Senate colleagues, Sen. Stephen A. Douglas of Illinois and Sen. Andrew P. Butler of South Carolina, who were both proponents of the Kansas-Nebraska Act and slavery. Sumner's harsh verbal attacks and personal insults towards Butler deeply angered Butler's relative, Rep. Preston Brooks. Feeling that his family's honor was at stake, Rep. Brooks sought retaliation and brutally assaulted Sen. Sumner with a cane on May 22, 1856, causing serious injuries to Sumner. The \\"Bleeding Sumner\\" incident intensified the already strained relations between the North and the South: 1. Highlighted sectional tensions: The incident highlighted the growing divide between Northern and Southern politicians over the issue of slavery. Sumner became a symbol of Northern resolve against slavery and its extension to new territories, while Brooks gained notoriety in the South for his defense of Southern honor and pro-slavery principles. 2. Demonstrated the intensity of the conflict: The violence in the Senate illustrated that the debate over slavery was no longer confined to intellectual or legislative discussions—physical violence had entered the political discourse, demonstrating the depth of emotions around these issues. 3. Strengthened the resolve of Abolitionists and anti-slavery activists: The attack on Sumner galvanized anti-slavery activists in the North, who pointed to the incident as a sign of Southern brutality and the need for more vigorous opposition to the spread of slavery into new territories. 4. Solidified the positions of both sides: Particularly in the 1856 presidential election, the incident influenced political campaigns and platforms, further polarizing the nation. It solidified the positions of both the North and the South, making it increasingly difficult for compromise on contentious issues like slavery and state sovereignty. In summary, the \\"Bleeding Sumner\\" incident was an important event that contributed to the escalation of tensions between the North and the South in the years leading up to the Civil War. It demonstrated the increasingly violent nature of the political debate around slavery, further polarized the nation, and helped set the stage for the ultimate conflict in 1861."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

She set him down on the hardwood floor and he clipped around like a fawn - - clip, clip -- looking through doorways and carefully eyeing us both. He was tiny but he was strong. He was muscular and sleek, like a miniature greyhound, and we both watched intently as he clipped around, soldiering things out and whining under his breath. Miss Tennessee looked at me and smiled and said: \\"Well honey? What do you think?\\" And I told her: \\"I love the little guy.\\" He was never really my dog. He was more like my step-dog, but together we named him Steve. We thought it was funny, giving a dog a man's name like that. But it fit, like Miss Tennessee, which I started just to tease her about being full-grown and long- legged and pretty, but in a tomboyish way that made it both absolutely ridiculous and absolutely plausible that she had ever been Miss Anything. It always made her swallow a grin. Steve's name, on the other hand, made it sound like he wasn't a dog at all, but this little man. Miss Tennessee often called him that: the little man. Steve liked me okay but he loved Miss Tennessee. With me it was man things. After he got snipped or when he was stung by bees, down there, in grass that came up to his chin, he would come sit by me, hoping I'd understand. With her, it was everything else. When she took a bath, he stood with his paws on the side of the tub, and when she went someplace he couldn't go he stood where he last saw her and waited.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Where the Real Sarabeth Dines Be prepared to ditch the brogues or stilettos before setting foot in Sarabeth Levine’s immaculate (and she wants to keep it that way) two-bedroom co-op on the Upper West Side. “I’m a very clean person and I have a very clean apartment,” said Ms. Levine, 70, the owner, with her husband, Bill, 81, of the half-dozen restaurants in New York City that bear her name; an equal number of outposts in Westchester, Long Island, Key West and Tokyo; and a mail-order food business. “I have wood floors and they are very well cared for. You can eat off them, and that is not an exaggeration.” It’s true, the honey-toned floors look as though they were installed yesterday. The light that pours in extravagantly on sunny days intensifies the glow. But with all due respect to the oak planks that pave the railroad apartment’s 1,500 square feet, first-time visitors will almost certainly find their eyes turned elsewhere. Specifically, they’ll be staring at the kitchen while trying valiantly not to blurt out something on the order of “But it’s so ... small” or “Seriously? Formica counters?” or “A Magic Chef stove? I guess the store was all out of Viking and Garland.” To be fair, the space, which was renovated in 1991 and has a slight ’50s feel, is utterly respectable. The speckled countertops and white cabinets are in fine shape; the appliances gleam, and so what if the refrigerator isn’t Sub-Zero. But it’s out of sync with expectations, rather like finding a plastic wading pool in Michael Phelps’s backyard. “People never say anything when they see my kitchen,” said the wiry, bespectacled Ms. Levine, who looks like a character out of “Doonesbury.” “Kitchens are great, and beautiful kitchens are very beautiful. But here’s my belief about kitchens: a big fancy one doesn’t make you a cook. “And remember, I’m always around food in my restaurants and in my bakery business. I have large stoves and huge walk-in refrigerator-freezers and machines that roll out dough for me, so my equipment desire is satisfied at my workplace. The last thing I wanted at home was a monster stove, O.K.? For me, my kitchen is perfect the way it is. It reflects my character. It’s nice, it’s cozy.” The relative absence of kitchen jewelry also means there’s plenty of room to display the choice pieces in Ms. Levine’s assemblage of cake platters, teapots and vintage cookie jars. “I love cookie jars,” she said. “They signify home — and cookies. My grandchildren were going to call me Grandma Cookie. I 86’ed that one.” Pride of place goes to the three containers with a likeness of the comic-strip character Little Lulu. “I love Little Lulu,” Ms. Levine said. “She was a brat. She was spunky and bossy. She had stamina. That’s me. I have stamina.” That stamina helps when Ms. Levine is on the hunt for this or that desirable thing. When, for example, she discovered a pair of discarded mint-condition Maison Gatti cafe chairs on the sidewalk, she brought them home for the kitchen, had four made in a reverse pattern, and then triumphantly bid on another six for her weekend house in Water Mill, N.Y., after seeing them on display at a Housing Works thrift shop. Ms. Levine married into the fifth-floor apartment, which for years had been the home/office of Mr. Levine, the former co-owner of a construction business. Sarabeth and Bill met in a singles group in 1979 and quickly discovered just how much they had in common. He was divorced. She was divorced. He was mensch-y. She was mensch-y. He had two daughters. She had two daughters. He had just acquired a piece of a soon-to-open restaurant on East 34th Street and was uncertain about the menu. She had a great family recipe for orange-apricot marmalade. “I made it for the opening and everyone flipped over it,” said Ms. Levine, a self-taught cook. Personally and professionally everything jelled. “I started putting the marmalade in jars,” she said. “I took it to Balducci’s and told them Bloomingdale’s had bought it, which wasn’t true. And I went to Bloomingdale’s and told them Balducci’s had bought it.” The wedding was in 1981, the year Sarabeth first put her name on a retail space —a small bakery. Bill ultimately ditched construction to help her build the business. Fittingly, the apartment is a blend of his (the antique brass bed); hers (the kidney-shaped desk topped with a Deco Chase lamp, the diminutive rocking chair); and theirs (a side-by-side bow-front cabinet that holds an assortment of Limoges pieces, among them a croissant and a banana, gifts to Ms. Levine from Mr. Levine). The living room has a fireplace, a basic necessity for Ms. Levine, and a piano that she plays strictly for her own enjoyment. Mr. Levine plops in the shabby-chic easy chair, Ms. Levine claims the sofa. Dinner is carryout, often from Chirping Chicken, never from Sarabeth’s — it’s too much like taking work home —though they make an exception for the restaurant’s biscuits and Caesar salad dressing. “This is where we go to relax,” she said. “We’ll sit in here and eat off the coffee table and watch our favorite programs and just hang out.” The quiet, the abundant light, the way Ms. Levine can see the fireplace from the kitchen — the apartment is pretty much perfection. But she speaks longingly of a foyer. “That’s the one thing I wish I had,” she said. “When you walk in here there’s no place to settle yourself. But it certainly doesn’t make me want to move.” Not a chance of that. Because Ms. Levine likes to meet with the night team at the company bakery where she spends the bulk of her time, the workday doesn’t end until 7:30, sometimes later if she stops by one of her restaurants. “So for me when the cab lets me out in front of our building, it’s like, ‘Sigh, I’m home,’ ” she said. “I get into the elevator, I push ‘5’ and I just can’t wait to get upstairs.” A version of this article appears in print on February 9, 2014, on page RE4 of the New York edition with the headline: Where the Real Sarabeth Dines. Order Reprints|Today's Paper|Subscribe","output":"The article discusses Sarabeth Levine's apartment on the Upper West Side and provides a glimpse into her personal life. Sarabeth, 70, and her husband, Bill, 81, own several restaurants in New York City, Westchester, Long Island, Key West, and Tokyo, as well as a thriving mail-order food business. The focus of the article is on the simplicity of their home, particularly the kitchen, which is contrasted with people's expectations given their successful business empire. The kitchen is described as small, with Formica counters and a Magic Chef stove. Sarabeth explains that she doesn't need a big, showy kitchen at home as she gets to work in professional kitchens in her businesses every day. Sarabeth's home is filled with character and a blend of her and her husband's belongings, including vintage cookie jars, antique furniture, and various knick-knacks. Sarabeth appreciates the quiet and the abundant natural light in their apartment, and although she wishes she had a foyer, she has no desire to move. She values the sanctuary their home provides after her long workdays, overseeing staff at her restaurants and bakery. The article concludes with a quote from Sarabeth expressing her gratitude for the comfort and refuge her home offers: \\"So for me when the cab lets me out in front of our building, it’s like, ‘Sigh, I’m home,’...I get into the elevator, I push ‘5’ and I just can’t wait to get upstairs.”"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

In his post-defection debriefing, Koskov informs MI6 that the KGB's old policy of Smiert Spionam, meaning Death to Spies, has been revived by General Leonid Pushkin, the new head of the KGB. Koskov is later abducted from the safe-house and assumed to have been taken back to Moscow. Bond is directed to track down Pushkin in Tangier and kill him to forestall further killings of agents and escalation of tensions between the Soviet Union and the West. Bond agrees to carry out the mission when he learns that the assassin who killed 004 (as depicted in the pre-title sequence) left a note bearing the same message, \\"Smiert Spionam\\". Bond returns to Bratislava to track down the cellist, Kara Milovy. He determines that Koskov's entire defection was staged, and that Kara is actually Koskov's girlfriend. Bond convinces Kara that he is a friend of Koskov's and persuades her to accompany him to Vienna, supposedly to be reunited with him. They escape Bratislava while being pursued by the KGB, crossing over the border into Austria. Meanwhile, Pushkin meets with arms dealer Brad Whitaker in Tangier, informing him that the KGB is cancelling an arms deal previously arranged between Koskov and Whitaker. During his brief tryst with Milovy in Vienna, Bond visits the Prater to meet his MI6 ally, Saunders, who discovers a history of financial dealings between Koskov and Whitaker. As he leaves their meeting, Saunders is killed by Koskov's henchman Necros, who again leaves the...

Answer the following question: I have a new situation: Two brothers went to the doctor for their yearly examination. Liam found out he has high cholesterol, while Rudy found out his triglycerides and cholesterol are within normal parameters.  But I can use this background: Cholesterol has been implicated in heart disease for decades. Atherosclerosis is a disorder of the arteries in which cholesterol and other materials are deposited on the interior of the arterial wall. These deposits lead to the formation of plaques that can restrict or even block the flow of blood through these blood vessels (see Figure below ). A decrease in the flow of blood can lead to high blood pressure and a lowered oxygen supply to the heart muscle. A complete blockage of blood flow to parts of the heart (a heart attack) can cause significant damage due to oxygen deprivation, in some cases leading to death.  What is an answer for this question: Which brother was more at risk for heart disease? Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided, Liam, the brother with high cholesterol, is at a higher risk for heart disease compared to Rudy, whose triglycerides and cholesterol are within normal parameters.  Cholesterol plays a significant role in the development of atherosclerosis and the subsequent formation of plaques within the arterial walls. These plaques can hinder blood flow, contributing to high blood pressure and a reduced oxygen supply to the heart. When blood flow is severely limited or blocked entirely, the risk of a heart attack increases, potentially resulting in serious damage or even death.  Since Liam has high cholesterol, he is more susceptible to these health complications than his brother Rudy, whose cholesterol levels are within the normal range. Thus, it is crucial for Liam to work closely with his doctor to manage his cholesterol levels and reduce his risk for heart disease through lifestyle modifications and, if necessary, medications."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What was the first name of the daughter of the man who premiered a stream of \\"desk drawer\\" works in 1953? ?  Stalin's death in 1953 was the biggest step toward Shostakovich's rehabilitation as a creative artist, which was marked by his Tenth Symphony. It features a number of musical quotations and codes (notably the DSCH and Elmira motifs, Elmira Nazirova being a pianist and composer who had studied under Shostakovich in the year before his dismissal from the Moscow Conservatory), the meaning of which is still debated, while the savage second movement, according to Testimony, is intended as a musical portrait of Stalin. The Tenth ranks alongside the Fifth and Seventh as one of Shostakovich's most popular works. 1953 also saw a stream of premieres of the \\"desk drawer\\" works. During the forties and fifties, Shostakovich had close relationships with two of his pupils, Galina Ustvolskaya and Elmira Nazirova. In the background to all this remained Shostakovich's first, open marriage to Nina Varzar until her death in 1954. He taught Ustvolskaya from 1937 to 1947. The nature of their relationship is far from clear: Mstislav Rostropovich described it as \\"tender\\". Ustvolskaya rejected a proposal of marriage from him after Nina's death. Shostakovich's daughter, Galina, recalled her father consulting her and Maxim about the possibility of Ustvolskaya becoming their stepmother. Ustvolskaya's friend Viktor Suslin said that she had been \\"deeply disappointed\\" in Shostakovich by the time of her graduation in 1947. The relationship with Nazirova seems to have been one-sided, expressed largely through his letters to her, and can be dated to around 1953 to 1956. He married his second wife, Komsomol activist Margarita Kainova, in 1956; the couple proved ill-matched, and divorced three years later. In 1954, Shostakovich wrote the Festive Overture, opus 96; it was used as the theme music for the 1980 Summer Olympics. (His '\\"Theme from the film Pirogov, Opus 76a: Finale\\" was played as the cauldron was lit at the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Greece.)

Work began in May 1940 resulting in 13,000,000 cubic yards (9,900,000 m3) of material dredged from the opening of Pearl Harbor to build a channel to Ford Island as well as to create a turning channel around the island.  Material was also dredged to deepen the West Loch, East Loch, and Middle Loch for the mooring of battleships. With dredged material used as land fill, the island's size was increased from 334 acres (135 ha) to 441 acres (178 ha).The Navy replaced its PK, F5L, and H16 aircraft with newer models (see table below). In 1933 VP-8F arrived on station, and in 1935 the army bombers had become too large to be maintained and stored at Luke Field. Construction began on a new Army airfield, Hickam Army Airfield, named after pioneer U.S. Army Air Corps pilot Lieutenant Colonel Horace Meek Hickam. From 1936 to 1940 Pan American flew its Clipper service into Ford Island, using it as a refueling stop between the United States and Asia. The Navy built a 25,000 boathouse, spent 579,565 on a new crew barracks and built a firehouse, water-supply and lighting systems. In June 1936 the Navy lengthened the island's landing field by 400 feet (120 m), to 3,000 feet (910 m). In March 1937 Amelia Earhart, on her second visit to Luke Field, crashed her Lockheed Electra on takeoff. In 1939, after three years of construction, Hickam Field opened. The Army transferred its operations there, leaving Luke Field under Navy control. The latter was renamed Naval Air Station Ford Island, and became the headquarters of Patrol Wing 2; its former namesake was re-honored with a new base, Luke Air Force Base in Arizona.

Options: --yes; --it is not possible to tell; --no;","output":"--no; The hypothesis cannot be concluded as true if the premise is true for several reasons. First, as per the premise, the woman is a Texas A&M tennis player, which means she is primarily involved in the sport of tennis, not basketball. Tennis and basketball are both distinct sports with different sets of rules, equipment, and requisite skills. While it is possible that she might be playing basketball recreationally or during her leisure time, the premise makes no mention of her abilities or involvement in that sport. Secondly, the act of \\"dribbling\\" in the context of the premise refers to bouncing the tennis ball, which is not how that term is used in the context of basketball. In basketball, dribbling is the act of bouncing the basketball while moving on the court, and it is a crucial skill in the sport. In tennis, however, players do not generally dribble the ball during a game, as the objective is to hit the ball over the net and into the opponent's side of the court. The action of bouncing a tennis ball does not necessarily indicate a connection to basketball. Thirdly, the fact that the woman is from Texas A&M might not have any bearing on her supposed participation in basketball. Texas A&M is a large university with numerous athletic programs, and it is not uncommon for student-athletes to participate in only one sport at the collegiate level. As the premise states that she is a tennis player, it is more reasonable to assume her focus is on tennis, rather than basketball.

The island is 9. 6 km long and 5. 1 km wide. It has an area of 37, 3 square kilometers. It became a World Heritage Site in 1988 because of its bird life.     All the four kinds of special land birds can only be seen on Henderson Island. There are also fifteen non-local seabirds. Other local things include nine kinds of plants, four kinds of land snails, and one butterfly. Although no people live on the island, archaeological   evidence suggests that a small Polynesian group lived here between the 12th and 15th centuries until it disappeared. The reasons for its disappearance are unknown, but are probably related to the similar disappearance of the Polynesians on Pitcairn Island. Then Hendersonians would have depended on them for many of the basics of life.     On January 29* 1606, Henderson Island was discovered by Portuguese sailor Pedro Fermandes, who named it San Joao Baptista. On January 17, 1819, the island was rediscovered by British Captain Henderson, who named it Henderson Island. On March 2* 1819* Captain Henry King, sailing on the Elizabeth, landed on the island to find the Union flag already flying. His crew scratched the name of their ship on a tree, and for some years the name of the island was Elizabeth or Henderson. In the early 1980's, American businessman Arthur expressed interest in buying Henderson Island, and establishing a small settlement with an airport, farm and large houses. But the British government refused it at last* after environmentalist groups persuaded them to protect the natural ecology and environment of the island which became a World Heritage Site later.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What position at the paper would Henry be leaving if he went to work at the New York Sentinel?, using the article: The film takes place during a 24-hour period. Henry Hackett is the metro editor of the New York Sun, a fictional New York City tabloid. He is a workaholic who loves his job, but the long hours and low pay are leading to discontent. He is at risk of experiencing the same fate as his editor-in-chief, Bernie White, who put his work first at the expense of his family. The paper's owner, Graham Keighley, faces dire financial straits, so he has Alicia Clark, the managing editor and Henry's nemesis, impose unpopular cutbacks. Henry's wife Martha, a fellow Sun reporter on leave and about to give birth, is fed up because Henry seems to have less and less time for her, and she really dislikes Alicia Clark. She urges him to seriously consider an offer to leave the Sun and become an assistant managing editor at the New York Sentinel, another fictional newspaper (based on The New York Times), which would mean more money, shorter hours, and more respectability, but might also be a bit boring for his tastes. Minor subplots involve Alicia, Bernie, and Sun columnist Michael McDougal. McDougal is threatened by an angry city official named Sandusky whom McDougal's column had been tormenting for the past several weeks. Their drunken confrontation in a bar (later in the film) leads to gunfire, which gets Alicia shot in the leg through the wall. Alicia, who is having an affair with Sun reporter Carl and has expensive tastes, schemes to get a raise in her salary. Bernie reveals to Henry that he has recently been diagnosed with prostate cancer, which causes him to spend time tracking down his estranged daughter Deanne White, in an attempt to reconcile before his time is up., what would be the answer ?

What is the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who was bullied and ridiculed by his classmates? from the following article ?  Except for three months' formal schooling as a 12-year-old, during which he was bullied and ridiculed by his classmates, Percy was educated at home.  Rose, an autodidact with a dominating presence, supervised his music and literature studies and engaged other tutors for languages, art and drama. From his earliest lessons, Percy developed a lifelong fascination with Nordic culture; writing late in life, he said that the Icelandic Saga of Grettir the Strong was \\"the strongest single artistic influence on my life\\". As well as showing precocious musical talents, he displayed considerable early gifts as an artist, to the extent that his tutors thought his future might lie in art rather than music. At the age of 10 he began studying piano under Louis Pabst, a German immigrant then considered to be Melbourne's leading piano teacher. Grainger's first known composition, \\"A Birthday Gift to Mother\\", is dated 1893. Pabst arranged Grainger's first public concert appearances, at Melbourne's Masonic Hall in July and September 1894. The boy played works by Bach, Beethoven, Schumann and Scarlatti, and was warmly complimented in the Melbourne press.After Pabst returned to Europe in the autumn of 1894, Grainger's new piano tutor, Adelaide Burkitt, arranged for his appearances at a series of concerts in October 1894, at Melbourne's Royal Exhibition Building. The size of this enormous venue horrified the young pianist; nevertheless, his performance delighted the Melbourne critics, who dubbed him \\"the flaxen-haired phenomenon who plays like a master\\". This public acclaim helped Rose to decide that her son should continue his studies at  the Hoch Conservatory in Frankfurt, Germany, an institution recommended by William Laver, head of piano studies at Melbourne's Conservatorium of music. Financial assistance was secured through a fund-raising benefit concert in Melbourne and a final recital in Adelaide, after which mother and son left Australia for Europe on 29 May 1895.

The answer to the question: What two contributions did the four lunette murals symbolize? is inside the article: The Pennsylvania State Capitol houses the chambers for the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, the Pennsylvania Senate, and the Harrisburg chambers for the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania. The Capitol contains 475 rooms and has four floors, not including a mezzanine between the first and second floors, and a basement.  The bronze entrance doors of the capitol lead into the rotunda on the first floor with the grand staircase in the center. The staircase in the rotunda is an imperial staircase, similar to the one in the Palais Garnier in Paris, France. The staircase leads to the mezzanine between the first and second floors, before dividing into two staircases leading to the second floor. Edwin Austin Abbey painted four allegorical medallions around the base of the capitol dome, detailing the \\"four forces of civilization\\": Art, Justice, Science, and Religion. Four lunette murals were also painted by Abbey and \\"symbolize Pennsylvania's spiritual and industrial contributions to modern civilization\\". The lunettes are situated in the recesses of each arch in the rotunda. The rotunda is paved with tiles, hand-crafted by Henry Chapman Mercer, from the Moravian Pottery and Tile Works. Mercer produced 16,000 square feet (1,500 m2) of tile, which includes \\"377 mosaics, representing 254 scenes, artifacts, animals, birds, fish, insects, industries and workers from Pennsylvania history\\". The interiors of the rotunda and the dome are inscribed with a quote from William Penn made upon the foundation of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania: There may be room there for such a holy experiment.

Here is an article: While the Corvetteâs 61-year history has included some spectacular cars, aspirations for the 2014 model are the highest yet. The Stingray badge evokes the beloved second generation. More Photos » Imagine, if you will, that an unnamed manufacturer just released an all-new sports car. It rockets from 0 to 60 miles per hour in 3.8 seconds, pulls more than one lateral g on the skid pad and has a carbon-fiber hood and roof. The interior includes dual high-resolution screens, top-quality materials and the option of racing seats. The manual transmission, with 7 forward speeds, will execute rev-matched downshifts, and itâs mounted at the rear of the car for optimal weight distribution. Other serious performance hardware include a dry-sump oiling system (which keeps the engine lubricated during neck-straining cornering maneuvers), an electronically controlled differential and magnetic ride-control suspension. All of this is concealed beneath bodywork thatâs thoroughly dripping in exotic, low-slung menace. If Porsche made such a car, it would cost 125,000. If its fenders wore Ferrari badges, it would cost 200,000. But weâre talking about a Chevy with a starting price of 51,995. And this fact blows our minds just a little bit less because the car is a Corvette. Where that particular vehicle is concerned, weâve come to expect outrageous returns on our dollar. The Corvette has a long and often glorious history. But that continuity, stretching back to 1953, means that every new generation of the Corvette tends to be viewed through the prism of its predecessor. And itâs tempting to think of this seventh-generation Corvette Stingray (in âVette lingo, the C7) in terms of the sixth-generation Vette â itâs like a C6 with better seats, more power, better behavior at the limit. But then you start itemizing the list of aspects that are different, both quantifiable and subjective, and you realize that the C7 isnât much like a C6 at all. The new carâs ambitions are fundamentally loftier, a point underscored by the return of the Stingray name. (Chevrolet is surely hoping to evoke the world-beating 1963 Sting Ray rather than the 1976 model â a fixture of the âBoogie Nightsâ era â that last wore the badge.) Start with the handling. âHandlingâ was never something the old âVette was overly concerned with, as long as its lap times were low enough. The carâs breakaway behavior was a particular problem, as it would let go suddenly and with great drama â the C6 Corvette is the only car Iâve ever spun on a racetrack with the stability control system engaged. If Khrushchev and Kennedy had been that twitchy, we might all still be eating canned peas in our fallout shelters while watching âLeave It to Beaver.â The C7, though, is friendly and controllable all the way to the limit. The Z51 performance package includes an electronically controlled differential (called eLSD) that allows fine modulation of the carâs rear-end behavior, instantly adjusting from locked and stable to open and nimble, depending on the requirements at hand. After spending some quality time sliding around the Black Lake testing area at General Motorsâ proving ground in Milford, Mich., I concluded that buying a âVette without the Z51 package would be like getting a puppy without a leash. If you spend a little bit more for a leash, youâre going to have a lot better control of that puppy, right? And the Z51 package is a bargain. For 2,800 you get performance gearing, a transmission and differential cooler, bigger wheels and tires, bigger brakes, a firmer suspension, the dry-sump oil system and the piÃ¨ce de rÃ©sistance, that magic differential. I would also opt for the magnetic ride control system with performance traction management, which goes for 1,795. And the multimode performance exhaust costs a not-insignificant 1,195, but is worth it for the wonderful sounds, if not the five extra horsepower that it uncorks. So equipped, you have a 57,785 car that has everything you need. The Corvette Stingray is not a case where the base price is merely a teaser and the car you really want costs 50 percent more.

Their mission is to capture Nazi war criminal Dieter Vogel (Jesper Christensen)âinfamously known as \\"The Surgeon of Birkenau\\" for his medical experiments on Jews during World War IIâand bring him to Israel to face justice. Rachel and David present themselves as an ethnic German married couple from Argentina and Rachel plants herself as a patient at Vogel's obstetrics and gynaecology clinic. Both Stefan and David develop an attraction to Rachel. Rachel shows a preference for David, yet sleeps with Stefan shortly after David rebukes her advances. This tryst leads to Rachel becoming pregnant. Stefan also reveals to Rachel that David lost his entire family in The Holocaust. At a doctors appointment, Rachel injects Vogel with a sedative during an examination and induces the nurse (Vogel's wife) to believe that he has suffered a heart attack. Stefan and David arrive dressed as paramedics and make off with the unconscious Vogel in a faux ambulance, barely ahead of the real ambulance team. Under cover of night, the trio attempt their exfiltration at Wollankstrasse Station, on a railway line along the sector boundary between East and West Berlin, and next to a mail depot. As they prepare to load Vogel onto the stopped train he suddenly awakens and sounds the horn of the stolen mail van where he is being held, alerting East German guards to their presence.

It is one of three mainline Interstate highways located entirely in New England, the other two being I-89 and I-91. The largest cities along its route are Manchester, New Hampshire and Boston, Massachusetts. It also passes through the New Hampshire state capital of Concord.  - U.S. Route 3 (US 3) is a United States highway running from Cambridge, Massachusetts, through New Hampshire, to the CanadaUS border near Third Connecticut Lake, where it connects to Quebec Route 257.  - A mountain pass is a route through a mountain range or over a ridge. Since many of the world's mountain ranges have presented formidable barriers to travel, passes have been important since before recorded history, and have played a key role in trade, war, and migration. At lower elevations it may be called a hill pass. The highest pass is Mana Pass, located in the Himalayas on the border between India and China.  - New Hampshire is a state in the New England region of the northeastern United States. It is bordered by Massachusetts to the south, Vermont to the west, Maine and the Atlantic Ocean to the east, and the Canadian province of Quebec to the north.

The premiere of Current’s Countdown With Keith Olbermann averaged 179,000 viewers in news’ target demographic of 25- to 54-year-olds Monday at 8 p.m., according to numbers provided by Current.            That’s a big improvement for Current, which averaged 30,000 viewers in primetime for the first quarter.      PHOTOS: Keith Olbermann's Famous Feuds            Countdown also beat CNN in the demo at 8 p.m. – by a wide margin.      Eliot Spitzer’s In the Arena pulled in 89,000 viewers in the demo. (Spitzer was not anchoring due to a planned vacation.) But MSNBC’s Last Word with Lawrence O’Donnell notched 237,000 in the demo. Nevertheless, it is a solid start for Olbermann on his new network, which is in about 37 percent fewer households than CNN and MSNBC.      COVER STORY: The Confessions of Keith Olbermann            Olbermann has downplayed ratings expectation, but he’s clearly gunning for the competition on his former network. His show will consistently run past the 9 p.m. hour, a tactic commonly employed to stanch channel switching.      VIDEO: Keith Olbermann Presents Top 10 List on 'Late Show With David Letterman'      “We’re very pleased,” said Olbermann. “But like I said last week, it’s one night. We’ll need a couple of weeks to know where we're starting, and we're truly interested in next year and especially 2013.” ||||| Keith Olbermann rallied the troops on Twitter, gave a flurry of high profile interviews, and his new bosses at Current TV backed him with their best efforts at promoting their new franchise. The reality check came Tuesday, from Nielsen. According to ratings data released by Current, the Monday night debut of Countdown with Keith Olbermann had 179,000 viewers in the advertiser-coveted–and critical–demographic of viewers 25-54. The network declined to say what the show’s total viewing audience was. “It’s one night. We’ll need a couple of weeks to know where we’re starting,” Olbermann said in a statement released by the network.      While the network said it was also very pleased with the ratings, Olbermann’s move from MSNBC to Current has cost him in viewership. His old timeslot at MSNBC, now occupied by Lawrence O’Donnell, attracted 237,000 viewers in the demo–and that was only good enough for a third place finish behind Fox News and HLN’s Nancy Grace. Olbermann did beat CNN, In the Arena, but that show’s host, Eliot Spitzer has been off this week, and CNN’s ratings overall have been lower as interest in the Casey Anthony murder trial seems to have sent viewers to HLN for its wall-to-wall coverage.      Will viewers find Olbermann and bring the ratings up? As the host said, it takes time for new shows (even ones that look pretty much identical to old shows) to find their groove. But as a rule, opening night ratings tend to be higher than the nights that follow, as curious drop-in viewers who want to have a look on the first night don’t come back. More than two million viewers tuned in to watch CNN’s Piers Morgan open his new show with guest Oprah Winfrey. On Monday, with guest Ryan O’Neal, the total viewership was a far smaller 689,000.      The difference between Morgan and Olbermann, however, is the network that surrounds each show. CNN has strong viewership throughout the day and night to remind viewers about Piers Morgan Tonight and promote the show. Current, with its significantly smaller average audience, is pitching Countdown to a comparatively tiny group of viewers, forcing Current to spend money on advertising the show, or, as they did last night, sending Olbermann off in search of free media with an appearance on CBS’ Late Show with David Letterman. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"Keith Olbermann's show, Countdown, premiered on a channel called Current and was watched by 179,000 people aged 25-54. This was a big improvement for Current, which normally averages 30,000 viewers. Countdown beat CNN's show at the same time but was behind MSNBC's show. Keith and the channel are happy with the results but know it takes time to get more viewers."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Beginning the Age of Revolution, the American Revolution and the ensuing political upheaval during the last half of the 18th century saw the Thirteen Colonies of North America overthrow the governance of the Parliament of Great Britain, and then reject the British monarchy itself to become the sovereign United States of America. In this period the colonies first rejected the authority of the Parliament to govern them without representation, and formed self-governing independent states. The Second Continental Congress then joined together against the British to defend that self-governance in the armed conflict from 1775 to 1783 known as the American Revolutionary War (also called American War of Independence).

The original statement was \\"Greyhounds jumping out of the gate at a race.\\" The key words here are \\"Greyhounds\\", \\"jumping out\\", \\"gate\\", and \\"race\\". These words together tell us that greyhounds are initiating a race, as \\"jumping out of the gate\\" is the phrase used to denote the start of a race. Given the information present in the first statement, it is suggested that the greyhounds are, indeed, racing. When we consider the second sentence \\"Greyhounds are not racing\\", we can infer based on the given information that this statement is false. If greyhounds are \\"jumping out of the gate at a race,\\" they are by default involved in a race, which contradicts the statement that greyhounds are not racing.

If Hillary Clinton set up a Pinterest for Valentine's Day, we can only imagine it might look like this>>>https://t.co/nNfAynLJxE — Senator Rand Paul (@SenRandPaul) February 14, 2015      The profile has the hallmarks of a traditional Pinterest page with an \\"inspirational quotes\\" board...      ...and one for home decor ideas.      Then there's some more pointed jabs, like a board of photos of Democrats who lost in November...      a pin about her Russian reset button...      ... and another about her comment that she and Bill were \\"dead broke\\" when they left the White House and the money she makes from speaking gigs.      Trolling other 2016 hopefuls has become a past time for Paul. He's tweeted burns directed at Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush; he's not above using memes. But Paul isn't the only one using Internet culture and parody accounts to reach voters. Last month, the Democratic National Committee created a parody a Jeb Bush Instagram account to make fun of Bush's digital strategy.      Brace yourselves; 2016 looks to be the most meme-filled election in American history. ||||| Sen. Rand Paul (R., Ky) is choosing Valentine’s Day to take a jab at Hillary Clinton.      On Saturday morning, the senator’s Facebook page posted a message saying that “if Hillary Clinton set up a Pinterest page, we can only imagine it might look like this.” It included links to a mock profile on the photo-sharing site set up under Mrs. Clinton’s name.      The profile includes several references to moments that Mrs. Clinton likely would not highlight in a presidential campaign. One section called “shoulda, woulda, coulda” showcases images from her unsuccessful 2008 White House bid.      The profile also takes a jab at suspended NBC News anchor Brian Williams, with a picture of him interviewing Mrs. Clinton. The accompanying text reads: “You tell me your war story, I’ll tell you mine.”      Mrs. Clinton in 2008 had acknowledged making a mistake when she said she had come under hostile fire while in Bosnia. Mr. Williams is currently suspended for telling a false war story related to his time in Iraq.      This is not the first time the senator has used social media to take a jab at Mrs. Clinton or other likely White House candidates. In January, Mr. Paul’s political action committee, Rand PAC, posted an audio link of a fake phone call between Jeb Bush and Mrs. Clinton, in which actors portraying them argued over who’s “turn” it was to move into the White House. Mr. Paul’s PAC is also asking his followers to sign a petition to “say no” to Mrs. Clinton running for president.      Pinterest, a platform often used to share recipes and fitness tips, was used in the 2012 presidential campaign by Ann Romney to connect with women. Mrs. Romney’s pins were mostly recipes, patriotic photos and books.      ______________________________________________________            Politics Alerts: Get email alerts on breaking news and big scoops.

It isn’t the first time Paul has taken to social media to mock the former first lady. After last November’s midterms, he sent out a series of tweets that used the hashtag #HillarysLosers and showed pictures of Clinton appearing with Democratic Senate candidates who’d just been defeated.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. The Broncos made their first visit to Tampa Bay since 2004. Cornerback Aqib Talib, who made his return to Tampa Bay where he played for the Buccaneers from 2018-2012, intercepted Buccaneers' quarterback Jameis Winston on the third play of the opening drive. The Broncos immediately capitalized, with quarterback Trevor Siemian throwing an 11-yard touchdown to wide receiver Demaryius Thomas. On the Buccaneers' next drive, a 7-yard touchdown run by Winston tied the game, which would be the Buccaneers' only scoring play of the game. Following another interception of Winston by Talib, the Broncos re-claimed the lead, with a 1-yard touchdown run by running back C. J. Anderson. With 3:25 remaining in the first half, Siemian injured his non-throwing shoulder when he was sacked by defensive tackle Clinton McDonald, and backup quarterback Paxton Lynch, the team's first-round draft selection, took over in his NFL debut.

Question 2: How can I have 2 WhatsApp accounts for the same number on different devices? Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","output":"No, questions 1 and 2 are not asking the same thing. They are asking different questions related to WhatsApp usage on different devices with one number or account. Question 1: Is it possible to use WhatsApp on two different devices associated with the same number/account? Answer: Currently, you cannot use WhatsApp on two different devices using the same number or account simultaneously. WhatsApp employs a one-phone, one-account policy, and it does not support multi-device compatibility with a single phone number or account. However, it is essential to note that WhatsApp currently has a feature called \\"WhatsApp Web,\\" which allows users to access their WhatsApp account on a computer or tablet via a QR code linked to their mobile device. This is not a standalone feature, and it only works while your mobile phone stays connected to the internet, which means your phone, computer, or tablet need to be connected to the internet at the same time. Question 2: How can I have 2 WhatsApp accounts for the same number on different devices? Answer: It is not possible to have two WhatsApp accounts associated with the same phone number on different devices. WhatsApp uses your phone number as the unique identifier for creating your account, and having two accounts with the same number goes against their guidelines. However, if you wish to have separate WhatsApp accounts on two devices, you can consider the following workaround: 1. Use two different phone numbers: You can register with two different phone numbers on two separate devices. For this, you need to have two different SIM cards, one for each account. You can use one for personal use and the other for work or any other purpose. Each phone number will have its own, separate WhatsApp account. 2. Use  Parallel Space or Dual Apps feature: Some smartphones offer a built-in feature called Dual Apps or App Twin, which allows users to clone their apps and have multiple instances of the same app on their device. This way, you can use two different WhatsApp accounts on your phone by cloning the WhatsApp application and using a different phone number for each account. This feature might vary depending on the device brand and model. Remember that using the Dual Apps feature still requires two different phone numbers, one for each instance of the WhatsApp app on your device. In summary, questions 1 and 2 differ - question 1 refers to using a single WhatsApp account on two different devices, while question 2 asks about having two separate WhatsApp accounts for a single phone number (albeit on different devices)."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: I know that the answer to the question \\"what is the last ethnicity mentioned?\\" is in \\"Although critics have blamed Napoleon for several tactical mistakes preceding the battle, they have also praised his audacity for selecting a risky campaign strategy, choosing to invade the Italian peninsula from the north when the vast majority of French invasions came from the west, near or along the coastline.

After the War of Independence, Catholics in the Southern Netherlands were systematically and officially discriminated against by the Northern Protestant government until the second half of the 20th century, which had a major influence on the economic and cultural development of the southern part of the Netherlands.  Present-day North Brabant (Staats-Brabant) was adjudicated to the Generality Lands of the Dutch Republic according to the 1648 Peace of Westphalia, while the reduced duchy remained in existence with the Southern Netherlands until it was conquered by French Revolutionary forces in 1794.  - The Hague (or \\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s-Gravenhage\\" ) is a city located in the western coast of the Netherlands, and the capital city of the province of South Holland.  - The Battle of Overloon was a battle fought in the Second World War battle between Allied forces and the German Army which took place in and around the village of Overloon in the south-east of the Netherlands between 30 September and 18 October 1944.

Select the topic that this about: RAMALLAH: Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat is  quot;very, very sick quot; and the ex-guerrilla who for decades symbolised a struggle for statehood is slipping in and out of consciousness, officials and medics said today.","output":"The given topic discusses the health condition of Yasser Arafat, the Palestinian leader and former guerrilla fighter, who had for several decades been a symbol of the struggle for Palestinian statehood. Arafat, who served as Chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and President of the Palestinian National Authority, suffered from an undetermined illness, which led to his slipping in and out of consciousness. Yasser Arafat had long been one of the most prominent figures in the Middle East, both as a leader of the Palestinian people and a key figure in the peace process with Israel. Born in Cairo in 1929, Arafat became involved in the Palestinian cause from a young age and eventually founded Fatah, a nationalist political party aimed at establishing an independent Palestinian state. Under Arafat's leadership, the PLO became the primary organization fighting for the rights of the approximately 9 million Palestinian people living in the Israeli-occupied territories of the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and East Jerusalem. Negotiations with Israel were often contentious, but Arafat played a pivotal role in representing Palestinian interests and pushing for a viable two-state solution. In 1994, Arafat received the Nobel Peace Prize along with Israeli leaders Yitzhak Rabin and Shimon Peres for their efforts to establish peace in the region through the Oslo Accords. Although the peace process faced several setbacks in the following years, Arafat remained a constant presence in the fight for Palestinian self-determination. In October 2004, Arafat's health began to decline rapidly, with the leader suffering from severe flu-like symptoms and the inability to keep food down. As his condition worsened, he was transferred from his besieged compound in Ramallah to a French military hospital for specialized medical treatment. While rumors circulated about the possible causes of his illness, ranging from food poisoning to a more grave condition, the exact nature of his ailment remained undiagnosed. The deterioration of Arafat's health obviously had significant implications for the Palestinian people and the future of the peace process. His absence from the helm of Palestinian politics left a vacuum that raised questions about who would emerge as the new leader and whether they would be able to continue Arafat's pursuit of a Palestinian state. As Arafat's condition worsened and he slipped in and out of consciousness, prayers for his recovery were held throughout Palestine, highlighting the deep connection many Palestinians felt toward their leader. Unfortunately, Arafat passed away on November 11, 2004, and his death marked the end of an era in the Palestinian struggle for statehood. To this day, Yasser Arafat remains a divisive figure in the Middle East, with some praising him as a freedom fighter and others denouncing him as a terrorist. Nevertheless, his impact on the Palestinian struggle for independence and the wider Middle Eastern peace process cannot be denied. His weakening health, as described in the statement, marked the beginning of a challenging period for Palestinian leadership and the ongoing quest for a peaceful resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Classmate Bill Stevenson impresses them with his musical talents and becomes their drummer. In 1979 they meet bassist Tony Lombardo in Long Beach and recruit him to the band. Nolte bows out to join his brothers in The Last, and Navetta, Stevenson, and Lombardo record the Descendents' debut single.

Both species are searching for Selene: the vampires seek justice for the death of Viktor, while the Lycans, led by Marius, intend to use her to locate Eve, whose blood holds the key to building an army of vampire-werewolf hybrids. Semira, a council member of the Eastern Coven, tells Thomas she wants Selene to be granted clemency and to train the coven's neophyte Death Dealers. She asks Thomas to plead Selene's case before the full council; the plea is successful and the council reluctantly agrees to a pardon in exchange for Selene's help. Selene arrives with David. Semira has Varga, her ally and lover, poison Selene and slaughter the trainees, framing Selene for the atrocity. With Selene in her power, Semira begins draining her blood, which she intends to drink to steal her power. Thomas and David attempt a rescue, but are attacked by Semira and Varga. Thomas is killed, but David and Selene escape. The pair takes refuge at the Nordic Coven, pursued by Alexia, an Eastern Coven vampire dispatched by Semira. At Var Dohr, the Nordic Coven stronghold, Elder Vidar reveals that David is the son of High Elder Amelia, and thus the legitimate heir to the Eastern Coven. Meanwhile, Alexia has told Marius, who is secretly her lover, that Selene is going to the Nordic Coven. Marius and his Lycans attack that coven. Selene and David fight alongside the Nordic vampires, who are led by Vidar's daughter Lena. Selene engages Marius in single combat, but he is too powerful in werewolf form, and she is stabbed by Alexia. Marius demands to know Eve's location, but Selene insists she does not know; Alexia confirms this after tasting blood from her sword. Marius sounds the retreat.

Earth has been devastated by a nuclear war instigated by five terrorists, and it has taken two million years for the radioactive clouds to once again allow sunlight to reach the surface. Only a handful of humans have survived the apocalypse, while the rest have changed into mutants who roam the radioactive wastelands. Eventually, humanity's true ancestors  – fairies, elves and dwarves – resurfaced and live in the idyllic land of Montagar in peace for three millennia.  While her people celebrated 3,000 years of peace, their ruler Delia, queen of the fairies, fell into a trance and left the party. Puzzled, the fairies followed her to her home and discover that she has given birth to twin wizards. They were the kindhearted Avatar who spent much of his boyhood entertaining his ailing mother with beautiful visions and his mutated brother Blackwolf, who was pure-evil, never visiting his mother, but spending his time torturing small animals. When Blackwolf learned of their mother's death, he attempted to usurp her leadership, being defeated in duel against a grief-stricken Avatar. Blackwolf left Montagar with a vow to return and \\"make this a planet where mutants rule\\". Years later, Blackwolf has risen to lead the dark land of Scortch, where he and his vast army of goblins, ogres, and mutants salvage and restore ancient technology. He tries to attack Montagar twice, but is foiled both times when his mutant warriors become bored or sidetracked in the midst of battle. Blackwolf then discovers an old projector and reels of Nazi propaganda footage, using his magic to enhance it for psychological warfare: Inspiring his own soldiers while horrifying enemy troops into submission.

Emphasizing their vital importance, the speaker refers to SMEs as the \\"lifeblood of the European economy.\\" SMEs play a fundamental role in driving economic growth, fostering innovation, and creating employment opportunities. They represent the majority of businesses in the European Union and account for a significant share of private sector employment and value addition within the economy. Supporting and revitalizing SMEs is crucial for returning the European economy to a healthy state following periods of financial decline or periods affected by external factors such as the recent Covid-19 pandemic. In line with the statement, the speedy implementation of instruments, policies, and support measures tailored to address the unique challenges faced by SMEs could help expedite their recovery. Possible instruments may include government-backed financial assistance, tax incentives, or regulatory reforms aimed at reducing administrative burdens and boosting competitiveness. Furthermore, enhancing the digital transformation of SMEs through the use of new technologies and digital platforms may improve efficiency and market reach.

Adding means putting numbers together to make a bigger number. Let's break it down into easy and fun steps. Step 1: Understand the Concept Adding is like having a group of things, and then getting more things to make a bigger group. Imagine you have three apples and your friend gives you two more apples. Now, you have five apples in total. That's adding! You just added 3 and 2 to get 5. You can always use toys, candies, or even your fingers to understand adding better! Step 2: Practice with a Small Number Now that you know what adding means, let's practice with small numbers. Start by adding 1 to other numbers: 1 + 1 = 2 (One plus one equals two) 1 + 2 = 3 (One plus two equals three) 1 + 3 = 4 (One plus three equals four) Keep going and see how the numbers become bigger when you add more! Step 3: Work Through All the Different Addend Combinations An \\"addend\\" is just a fancy word for the numbers you are adding together. Try adding different numbers together like 2 and 3, or 4 and 1. You can make a number chart to help you remember which numbers you have tried: For example: 1 + 2 = 3 2 + 3 = 5 3 + 4 = 7 4 + 1 = 5 Keep practicing with different addends and see how much fun adding can be! Step 4: Use Visuals, if Necessary Using visuals can help you understand adding even better. You can draw pictures, use stickers, or even make number lines! Here's an example with a number line: 1 + 2 = 1 [start here] → 2 → 3 [end here] So, 1 + 2 = 3! Adding numbers can be lots of fun when you understand the concept and practice with different numbers. You can even try teaching your friends and family how to add. The more you practice, the better you'll get at it.

Choose your answer: Is \\"Many lawsuits turn on the meaning of a federal statute or regulation, and judicial interpretations of such meaning carry legal force under the principle of stare decisis.\\" a good answer to the question \\"What gives Congress limited power to enact statutes?\\" Pick your answer from: [-] yes [-] no","output":"No, the statement \\"Many lawsuits turn on the meaning of a federal statute or regulation, and judicial interpretations of such meaning carry legal force under the principle of stare decisis,\\" does not answer the question about what gives Congress limited power to enact statutes. The power of Congress to enact laws comes from the U.S. Constitution, specifically Article 1. The Constitution both grants certain powers to Congress and limits those powers, hence the phrase limited power. The powers granted to Congress can be categorized into two types: enumerated powers, which are directly mentioned in the Constitution, and implied powers, which are not specifically listed but are inferred from the enumerated powers. Enumerated powers include the power to levy and collect taxes, to coin money and regulate its value, to provide for the common defense and general welfare, to regulate commerce with foreign nations and between states, to establish post offices, etc. These powers are explicitly written in the Constitution. Implied powers are derived from the 'necessary and proper' clause in the Constitution. The clause states that Congress has the power to make all laws necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers and all other powers vested by this Constitution in the U.S. government. This clause has been interpreted to give Congress considerable power to pass laws as needed to accomplish its constitutional duties. One aspect that limits these powers is the principle of federalism. Powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, not prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people. This is according to the Tenth Amendment, part of the Bill of Rights. Further, although Congress can pass laws, it is also subject to checks and balances from the other branches of government. The President can veto legislation, and the Supreme Court can declare laws unconstitutional. Moreover, the Supreme Court interprets the Constitution's meaning, applying it to individual cases and controversies, thus sometimes influencing the legislative activity. The statement in question talks about a specific situation, where the courts interpret the laws and regulations created by Congress, under the principle of stare decisis (meaning to stand by things decided), which is the legal principle of determining points in litigation according to precedent. This principle ensures that legal decisions are predictable and not made arbitrarily, but it does not necessarily explain the limited power of Congress to enact laws."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

By Rose Parker Nearly a quarter of young Australian men are now obese and the impact on their health is similar to premature ageing, new research has revealed. A team at Deakin University's IMPACT Strategic Research Centre studied 2,500 men and women aged 20 to 96, using whole body scans to accurately assess fat and obesity levels. They concluded that 24 per cent of young men in the 20 to 29 age group were obese - a significant rise on the previous estimate which was just eight per cent. Researchers say that the huge discrepancy is due to problems with the Body Mass Index (BMI), which does not distinguish between different body shapes.

The chief inspector of immigration John Vine found potentially tens of thousands of applicants were approved without face-to-face interviews. As a minimum, they require enough money to pay for housing, plus a disposable income of more than £100 a week. But the chief inspector of immigration, John Vine, found potentially tens of thousands were having their applications rubber-stamped without either a face-to-face interview or HMRC investigation. An estimated one million migrants apply for permission to stay in the UK each year. But, incredibly, HMRC is willing to do only 3,000 checks a year for the UK Border Agency – just 250 every month. Such checks would establish if a migrant who claimed to be able to support themselves was telling the truth about their income or even having a job. As a result of the HMRC policy, officials are letting migrants stay without having had access to wages slips, P60 forms and other crucial data. Mr Vine, who carried out spot checks on a small sample of cases, said officials had granted permission to settle here despite the applicant having ‘zero income and no employment’. HMRC is only willing to do 3,000 checks a year for the UK Border Agency despite an estimated one million migrants applying for permission to stay in the country each year. He said the number of HMRC checks was ‘insufficient’ and must be urgently increased. Of 49 cases he looked at where. migrants were asking to stay on the grounds of marriage, not a single. person was interviewed. This is despite huge concern over sham. marriages. In other cases,. the application was decided while the husband or wife was still. overseas. Mr Vine said in one in every ten of such cases the decision. reached by immigration officials was ‘unreasonable’, mainly due to. insufficient evidence the migrant could afford to support themselves. The inspector raised his concerns in a report which focused on how UKBA handles cases involving marriage and civil partnerships. In. it, he also said there are currently more than 16,000 migrants waiting. to hear from border officials whether they can stay in Britain in yet. another ‘unacceptable’ UKBA backlog. Some. 14,000 applicants, growing at a rate of 700 a month, have already been. refused the right to stay but are pleading with officials to reconsider. An. additional 2,100 cases – shipped in a box from a UKBA office in Croydon. to Sheffield – are still waiting for an initial decision, some dating. back a decade. Mr Vine said: ‘This is completely unacceptable and I. expect the Agency to deal with both types of case as a matter of. urgency. John Vine said immigrants were being granted permission to settle despite having 'zero income and no employment' Ferry passengers caught entering Britain with cocaine in their luggage are being let off with just a small fine. Instead. of arresting and prosecuting, border officials are routinely. confiscating the drugs, allowing passengers to pay around £100 and then. letting them carry on their journey. John. Vine, chief inspector of Borders and Immigration, said the approach was. unlawful and anyone caught with Class A drugs should be put before a. court. His report into. border controls found two occasions where a small amount of cocaine was. discovered on a passenger or in their luggage coming into Dover via. Calais. Both cases involved less than 1g of the drug. Under. customs laws, passengers caught with small amounts of Class B and C. drugs can pay a ‘compound settlement’, have the drugs confiscated and. escape prosecution. But. that law does not extend to Class A drugs. Anyone caught entering with. even small amounts of heroin, cocaine or ecstasy must be arrested and. can face a lengthy prison sentence. The. report said: ‘Although the amount was small, we were concerned that in. one case investigators advised a compound settlement for the offence,. given that this was contrary to Border Force’s own guidance. ‘Border. Force subsequently informed us that they had revised their guidance to. reiterate that class A drugs fall outside the scope of compounding.’ ‘Delays also mean. enforcement action is likely to be more difficult in the event the case. is ultimately refused. This is because the individual will have been in. the UK for a number of years and may have developed a family or private. life.’ He also said the. percentage of successful appeals in marriage cases was too high, at 53. per cent from April 2011 to February last year. Mr Vine told Radio 4's Today programme this morning: 'Work is being transferred but missed or lost. The organisation should know what its own backlog and workload is, then it can prioritise. 'I was concerned at the high rate of appeal.' He admitted that 13 per cent of cases remained unresolved. Mark Harper, Minister of State for Immigration, told the show that the 14,000 outstanding appeals had not been done through the proper channels. 'We went and just allowed people to say, \\"can you just go through it again?\\" They should have given a clear message. 'We inherited an agency with a lot of problems.' Sir Andrew Green, of. Migration Watch, said: ‘This is yet further evidence of the chaos in the. immigration system.’ UKBA. said last night: ‘We are working with HMRC to increase the number of. searches we can do against their systems. Since this report we have. brought in strict new rules on proving income levels to make sure that. those bringing in family members are able to support them.’ Write highlights for this article.","output":"1.

Water flowing over Earths surface or underground causes erosion and deposition. Water flowing over a steeper slope moves faster and causes more erosion. How water transports particles depends on their size. When water slows down, it starts depositing sediment. This process starts with the largest particles first. Runoff erodes the land after a heavy rain. It picks up sediment. Runoff carries most of the sediment to bodies of water. Mountain streams erode narrow, V-shaped valleys and waterfalls. Erosion and deposition by slow-flowing rivers create broad floodplains and meanders. Deposition by streams and rivers may form alluvial fans and deltas. Floodwaters may deposit natural levees. Erosion and deposition by groundwater can form caves and sinkholes. Stalactites and stalagmites are mineral deposits. They build up in caves as water continues to drip.

The interesting fact about them wast that, while Twin I had a very cold water all year, Twin II lake had very warm waters year round.  Which body of water had fewer problems in the vicinity of industrial discharge ? Answer:","output":"The Twin Lakes seemed to have distinct characteristics - with Twin I having cold water throughout the year and Twin II featuring warm waters. In order to fully address the question about which body of water had fewer problems in the vicinity of industrial discharge, one must consider various factors such as water temperature, industrial waste composition and quantity, the surrounding ecosystem, and natural processes occurring within the lakes. Firstly, let's discuss the possible effects of water temperature. A major factor contributing to the eco-balance of any lake or river is its ability to absorb and break down industrial pollutants. Cold water, as exhibited by Twin I, generally has a lower capacity for dissolving substances compared to warm water (Twin II). This means that pollutants and waste could potentially accumulate more significantly in Twin I than Twin II. Cold water also tends to have less dissolved oxygen, making it harder for aquatic organisms to process and break down pollutants. On the flip side, warm water (such as in Twin II) generally supports higher levels of biological activity, which may aid in the decomposition and remediation of industrial waste. Considering the waste composition, the type and amount of pollutants discharged in the vicinity of Twin I and Twin II can have varying effects on each lake's ecosystem. For instance, if the industrial waste contains a considerable amount of heavy metals, the metals can adsorb to the sediment or become absorbed by aquatic plants, potentially posing more significant health risks in the colder Twin I due to lower dilution and mitigation capacities. However, if the industrial waste primarily consists of organic compounds, the warmer Twin II lake may suffer more due to eutrophication, a phenomenon wherein an excessive nutrient influx results in algal blooms, leading to oxygen depletion and subsequent harm to aquatic life. Furthermore, the surrounding ecosystem of the lakes plays a critical role in determining the effects of industrial discharge. The presence of vegetation such as wetlands or riparian buffers can help protect the lakes from harmful pollutants, acting as a natural filtration system. Additionally, these ecosystems are more resilient if they have a greater biodiversity and maintain a stable food chain. If either Twin I or Twin II have a more robust ecosystem and natural barriers to pollutants, it would experience fewer problems related to industrial discharge. Finally, the lakes' natural processes, such as seasonal temperature variations, water currents, stratification, and turbidity, could impact their ability to handle industrial waste. For example, if Twin I's cold waters experience temperature inversions and water turnovers more frequently, it may facilitate the better circulation and distribution of pollutants, thus lessening their impact on the aquatic life. Conversely, if the warmer Twin II lake remains stably stratified, it could lead to the segregation of temperature layers and hinder proper mixing or flushing of pollutants from the lake. Considering the factors mentioned above, it is challenging to provide a definitive and reliable answer to which lake had fewer problems in the vicinity of industrial discharge without concrete information about the specific industrial pollutants, the quantity of waste being discharged, as well as the characteristics of the surrounding ecosystem, and natural processes occurring within the lakes. However, in a general sense, it is possible that Twin II, with its warm waters, may be better suited to naturally break down and dissipate some pollutants due to its increased capacity for biological activity and enhanced solubility of substances. Nevertheless, this must be weighed against the risk of eutrophication, which favors environments with higher levels of nutrients and biological activity. Comprehensive research and monitoring should be conducted on each lake to provide accurate and tailored assessments in terms of industrial discharge impact."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The film's plot revolves around the engagement of Greg Focker and Pam Byrnes, with the couple planning to introduce their respective families. They fly to Oyster Bay, New York, to pick up Pam's parents, Jack and Dina (Blythe Danner), and her one-year-old nephew Little Jack. Instead of flying to Miami where the Fockers live, Jack decides to drive everyone there in his new RV. Upon arrival, they meet Greg's parents, Bernie (Dustin Hoffman) and Roz (Barbra Streisand), who have eccentric personalities, with Roz being a sex therapist for elderly couples. Greg, growing concerned that Jack might not approve of his parents' lifestyle, convinces Roz to pose as a yoga instructor for the weekend. Throughout their visit, tensions rise between Jack and the Fockers as their contrasting personalities clash, leading to a series of mishaps, misunderstandings, and suspicion towards Greg's character. Additionally, Pam and Greg discover they are expecting a child, but they decide to keep it a secret from Jack. One notable incident involves the Fockers' dog and the Byrnes' cat engaging in a chase that results in Bernie having to destroy the RV toilet to save the dog. Further complications arise with the introduction of the Fockers' housekeeper, Isabel Villalobos, which prompts Jack to suspect that Greg fathered her son, Jorge. As the plot progresses, various secrets are revealed and the characters face challenging moments before ultimately finding a way to come together as a family. In summary, the movie \\"Meet the Fockers\\" tells a comedic and heartfelt story about family dynamics, trust, and acceptance. Jack Byrnes, portrayed by Robert De Niro, is a retired CIA operative, and his involvement with the agency provides a backdrop to the humorous and tense interactions between the two families."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

CHAPTER II  One evening Fru Astrida sat in her tall chair in the chimney corner, her distaff, with its load of flax in her hand, while she twisted and drew out the thread, and her spindle danced on the floor. Opposite to her sat, sleeping in his chair, Sir Eric de Centeville; Osmond was on a low bench within the chimney corner, trimming and shaping with his knife some feathers of the wild goose, which were to fly in a different fashion from their former one, and serve, not to wing the flight of a harmless goose, but of a sharp arrow.  The men of the household sat ranged on benches on one side of the hall, the women on the other; a great red fire, together with an immense flickering lamp which hung from the ceiling, supplied the light; the windows were closed with wooden shutters, and the whole apartment had a cheerful appearance. Two or three large hounds were reposing in front of the hearth, and among them sat little Richard of Normandy, now smoothing down their broad silken ears; now tickling the large cushions of their feet with the end of one of Osmond's feathers; now fairly pulling open the eyes of one of the good-natured sleepy creatures, which only stretched its legs, and remonstrated with a sort of low groan, rather than a growl. The boy's eyes were, all the time, intently fixed on Dame Astrida, as if he would not lose one word of the story she was telling him; how Earl Rollo, his grandfather, had sailed into the mouth of the Seine, and how Archbishop Franco, of Rouen, had come to meet him and brought him the keys of the town, and how not one Neustrian of Rouen had met with harm from the brave Northmen. Then she told him of his grandfather's baptism, and how during the seven days that he wore his white baptismal robes, he had made large gifts to all the chief churches in his dukedom of Normandy.  1.

While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Answer the following question: Information:  - A given name (also known as a personal name, Christian name, first name, or forename) is a part of a person's full nomenclature. It identifies a specific person, and differentiates that person from other members of a group, such as a family or clan, with whom that person shares a common surname. The term \\"given name\\" refers to the fact that the name usually is \\"bestowed\\" upon a person, normally \\"given\\" to a child by its parents at or near the time of birth. This contrasts with a surname (also known as a family name, last name, or gentile name), which is normally inherited, and shared with other members of the child's immediate family.  - Unicode is a computing industry standard for the consistent encoding, representation, and handling of text expressed in most of the world's writing systems. Developed in conjunction with the Universal Coded Character Set (UCS) standard and published as \\"The Unicode Standard\\", the latest version of Unicode contains a repertoire of more than 128,000 characters covering 135 modern and historic scripts, as well as multiple symbol sets. The standard consists of a set of code charts for visual reference, an encoding method and set of standard character encodings, a set of reference data files, and a number of related items, such as character properties, rules for normalization, decomposition, collation, rendering, and bidirectional display order (for the correct display of text containing both right-to-left scripts, such as Arabic and Hebrew, and left-to-right scripts). , the most recent version is \\"Unicode 9.0\\". The standard is maintained by the Unicode Consortium.  - A synonym is a word or phrase that means exactly or nearly the same as another word or phrase in the same language. Words that are synonyms are said to be synonymous, and the state of being a synonym is called synonymy. The word comes from Ancient Greek \\"sýn\\" (\\"with\\") and \\"ónoma\\" (\\"name\\"). An example of synonyms are the words \\"begin\\", \\"start\\", \\"commence\\", \\"initiate\\", \\"fun\\", \\"pleasing\\" . Words can be synonymous when meant in certain senses, even if they are not synonymous in all of their senses. For example, if one talks about a \\"long time\\" or an \\"extended time\\", \\"long\\" and \\"extended\\" are synonymous within that context. Synonyms with exact meaning share a seme or denotational sememe, whereas those with inexactly similar meanings share a broader denotational or connotational sememe and thus overlap within a semantic field. Some academics call the former type cognitive synonyms to distinguish them from the latter type, which they call near-synonyms.  - A surname or family name is a name added to a given name. In many cases, a surname is a family name and many dictionaries define \\"surname\\" as a synonym of \\"family name\\". In the Western Hemisphere, it is commonly synonymous with last name because it is usually placed at the end of a person's given name there.  - In the German alphabet, the (traditionally lowercase-only) letter ß, called Eszett or scharfes S, in English \\"sharp S\\", is a consonant that evolved as a ligature of \\"long s and z\\" (z) and \\"long s over round s\\" (s). It is pronounced (see IPA). Since the German orthography reform of 1996, it is used only after long vowels and diphthongs while \\"ss\\" is written after short vowels. The name \\"Eszett\\" comes from the two letters S and Z as they are pronounced in German. Its Unicode encoding is U+00DF.  - The long, medial, or descending s () is a form of the minuscule (lower-case) letter \\"s\\", which was formerly used where \\"s\\" occurred in the middle or at the beginning of a word (e.g. \\"infulnes\\" for \\"sinfulness\\" and \\"uccesful\\" for \\"successful\\"). The modern letterform was called the \\"terminal\\", \\"round\\", or \\"short\\" s.  - The German orthography reform of 1996 (\\"\\") was a change to German spelling and punctuation that was intended to simplify German orthography and thus to make it easier to learn, without substantially changing the rules familiar to users of the language.   - Strauss , Strauß or Straus is a common Germanic surname . Outside Germany and Austria Strauß is always spelled Strauss ( the letter \`\` ß '' is not used in the German - speaking part of Switzerland ) . The families using the Strauss name represent a genetically varied group of people of both Jewish and Germanic origin . The name has been used by families in the Germanic area for at least a thousand years . The overlord of Gröna for example , went by the name of Struz and used the image of an ostrich as his symbol . Examples of it could still be seen on the thousand - year - old church bell of that town . \`\` Struz '' or \`\` Strutz '' is the North - German form of the word \`\` Strauss '' , which is the modern German word for an \`\` Ostrich '' . Some of the earliest Jewish bearers of the name hailed from the Judengasse in medieval Frankfurt , where families have been known by the name of the houses they inhabited . All the houses had names and these included Haus Strauss , complete with an image of an ostrich on the façade . When , for tax purposes , Napoleon made surnames obligatory in 1808 , some more Jewish families decided to adopt the Straus ( s ) name .  - An alphabet is a standard set of letters (basic written symbols or graphemes) that is used to write one or more languages based upon the general principle that the letters represent phonemes (basic significant sounds) of the spoken language. This is in contrast to other types of writing systems, such as syllabaries (in which each character represents a syllable) and logographies (in which each character represents a word, morpheme, or semantic unit).  - The Western Hemisphere is a geographical term for the half of the earth that lies west of the Prime meridian (which crosses Greenwich, UK) and east of the antimeridian, the other half being called the Eastern Hemisphere.   - A diphthong (or ; from Greek: , \\"diphthongos\\", literally \\"two sounds\\" or \\"two tones\\"), also known as a gliding vowel, is a combination of two adjacent vowel sounds within the same syllable. Technically, a diphthong is a vowel with two different targets: that is, the tongue (and/or other parts of the speech apparatus) moves during the pronunciation of the vowel. In many dialects of English, the phrase \\"no highway cowboys\\" has five distinct diphthongs, one in every syllable.  - In articulatory phonetics, a consonant is a speech sound that is articulated with complete or partial closure of the vocal tract. Examples are , pronounced with the lips pronounced with the front of the tongue pronounced with the back of the tongue pronounced in the throat; and , pronounced by forcing air through a narrow channel (fricatives); and and , which have air flowing through the nose (nasals). Contrasting with consonants are vowels.  - An orthography is a set of conventions for writing a language.

What is the cause?","output":"There could be several causes for your mailbox overflowing with letters. Given the premise, let's consider and analyze a few possibilities: 1. Infrequent Mail Collection: One of the primary reasons for a mailbox overflowing with letters could be the infrequency of mail collection. If you have not been picking up your mail regularly or have been away from home for an extended period, the volume of mail can accumulate and result in an overflowing mailbox. 2. Address Mistake or Identity Mix-up: It's possible that some of the mail delivered to your mailbox was not meant for you. There can be instances where senders may have written the incorrect address, your address might be similar to someone else's or the mail carrier may have mistakenly delivered someone's mail to your mailbox. This error could add to your pile and eventually lead to an overflowing mailbox. 3. Subscription Services or Catalogs: If you have signed up for multiple subscription services, newsletters, or catalogs, it is possible that their simultaneous or excessive delivery could result in an overflow of mail in your mailbox. Many subscription deliveries happen monthly or weekly, and these can quickly fill up your mailbox if you are unable to keep up with their pace. 4. Seasonal Surge: There are times in the year when mail delivery can significantly increase, such as during the holiday season. During such times, your mailbox might experience a surge in deliveries due to special promotional materials, greeting cards, or gift packages. 5. Delinquent Account Notices: If you have any unpaid bills or pending account-related matters, you may receive multiple letters, invoices, or notifications from the associated organizations or companies. These may include utilities, bank statements, insurance companies, or other service providers that require your attention, which in turn could lead to your mailbox overflowing. 6. Political or Promotional Mail: During election seasons or other significant events, a large amount of political or promotional mail may be sent to you. These materials can contribute to an increased volume of incoming mail, which might result in an overflowing mailbox. 7. Spam or Unsolicited Mail: Lastly, your mailbox may overflow due to unsolicited mail or spam. This could include advertisements, marketing materials, and other promotional items sent without your consent. Companies often use mass mailings to reach as many people as possible, and this could increase your daily mail intake. To prevent an overflowing mailbox, it is essential to check and empty your mailbox regularly and manage your subscriptions or mailing preferences. Additionally, you can consider opting for paperless billing and communication options wherever possible, further reducing the volume of physical mail received. In rare cases, you might need to contact your local postal carrier or post office to report a mail delivery issue or request a hold on your mail during vacations or extended periods away from home. In conclusion, multiple factors can contribute to a mailbox overflowing with letters. These can range from personal habits and circumstances to systemic or administrative issues. By understanding these potential causes, you can take the necessary steps to maintain a manageable mailbox and avoid an overwhelming amount of mail."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The county seat of Suffolk County, NY lies at the mouth of a river that flows into which body of water? Answer:","output":"The county seat of Suffolk County, New York is Riverhead. The town lies at the mouth of the Peconic River, which flows into the Peconic Bay.  The Peconic Bay is a sizable body of water located on the eastern end of Long Island, in between the North and South Forks. The bay is further divided into smaller sections, including the Great Peconic Bay, Little Peconic Bay, and other smaller interconnected bodies of water. Overall, the Peconic Bay system forms an estuary that is fed by a number of rivers, including the Peconic River. The Peconic River originates from west-central Suffolk County, near Brookhaven National Laboratory, and flows eastward into Riverhead before it empties into the Flanders Bay, which forms part of the larger Peconic Bay system. The river, spanning about 15 miles, is the longest river on Long Island, and it is relatively unique as it flows from west to east, while the majority of the North American rivers flow southward or from the north to the south. Similarly, the Peconic Bay is one-of-a-kind, making part of an estuarine complex which is renowned for its outstanding aquatic and terrestrial biodiversity. This wetland system constitutes a vital hub for numerous species of fish, shellfish, migratory waterfowl, and other types of wildlife.

Question: Why are Big Bird's friends sad? Title: Sesame Street presents Follow That Bird Movie plot: The members of the Feathered Friends' Board of Birds (consisting of the Madame Chairbird, a sparrow, a turkey, a puffin, a robin, and an owl) discuss their situation about Big Bird and hope that they can find a bird family to put him with. The group's social worker Miss Finch (performed by Cheryl Wagner and voiced by Sally Kellerman) is sent to Sesame Street to find Big Bird a worthy bird family and bring him to the selected family. After leaving Sesame Street, New York City, New York, Miss Finch brings Big Bird to the fictional town of Oceanview, Illinois to live with a family of dodos. The dodos all think very poorly of non birds, even saying he should have a bird as a best friend instead of Mr. Snuffleupagus (who is currently watching over Big Bird's nest). This causes him much distress. When Big Bird runs away from his new home and ends up on the news, Miss Finch tells Kermit the Frog that she will reclaim him. His friends back on Sesame Street also see the news and band together to find him before Miss Finch does. In a Volkswagen Beetle is the group of Gordon, Olivia, Linda, and Cookie Monster. Count von Count departs in his Countmobile. Ernie and Bert go out to search in an airplane. Grover flies as Super Grover (later falling into the Volkswagen).

Solve this math problem Solve -9*u + 18 = -0 for u.","output":"To solve the equation -9*u + 18 = -0 for the variable u, follow these steps: Step 1: Simplify the equation The equation given is -9*u + 18 = -0. The negative zero on the right side can be simplified to just 0, so the equation becomes: -9*u + 18 = 0 Step 2: Isolate the term with the variable u To find the value of u, we need to isolate the term with the variable u on one side of the equation. To do this, we'll subtract 18 from both sides: -9*u + 18 - 18 = 0 - 18 This simplifies to: -9*u = -18 Step 3: Solve for u Now that the term with the variable u is isolated, we can solve for the value of u by dividing both sides of the equation by -9: (-9*u) / -9 = (-18) / -9 This simplifies, and we get the value of u: u = 2 So, the solution to the equation -9*u + 18 = -0 is u = 2."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

(Deborah Rush), begs him not to, but when the drunk turns mean, Osgood challenges him to step outside. To D.D.'s astonishment, Osgood wins the fight and even gets the tough-looking drunk to apologize. Next morning, it turns out that the drunk is Nick Escalante, known to his friends as Mex, who has been hired to make Osgood look tough in his lady's eyes.

There are hundreds of skills to help you read more in less time. Here are two skills that I think are very good. Preview -- if it's long and hard. Previewing is very useful for getting a general idea of heavy reading like long magazine articles and science reports. Here is how to preview. *Read the first two paragraphs and the last two paragraphs carefully. *Then read only the first sentence of the other paragraphs. Previewing doesn't give you all the details. It tells you not to spend time on things you don't really want or need to read. Skim -- if it's short and simple. Skimming is a good way to get a general idea of light reading, like popular magazines or the sports of your daily paper. Here's how to skim. *Get your eyes to move fast. Sweep them across each line. *Pick up only a few key words in each line. Everybody skims differently. You and I may not pick up the same words when we skim the same piece, but perhaps we'll get the same idea of what it's all about. Question: What should we do when we read a science report?

Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","output":"The hypothesis \\"He let Anse fall to the floor\\" is not entailed by the premise \\"Other hands joined his to boost Anse.\\" To determine whether a hypothesis is entailed by a premise, we should examine the relationship between the information given in the premise and the proposed outcome in the hypothesis. In this particular situation, the premise states that other hands have joined together with someone to help boost Anse. This suggests that there is a collaborative effort to lift or support Anse in some manner. The act of \\"boosting\\" in this context generally carries a positive connotation, implying assistance and encouragement. On the other hand, the hypothesis proposes that someone let Anse fall to the floor. This statement's implication is contrary to the premise because it portrays a negative outcome where Anse is not supported or lifted but instead is allowed to fall. Allowing Anse to fall to the floor implies a failure or lack of support, which contradicts the collaborative effort to boost Anse mentioned in the premise. In conclusion, the hypothesis \\"He let Anse fall to the floor\\" is not entailed by the premise \\"Other hands joined his to boost Anse,\\" as the information in the premise does not imply or suggest the negative outcome mentioned in the hypothesis.

While money is the typical form of payment at many establishments, there are instances in which different items are exchanged or offered to a clerk. Analyzing the options provided - ticket booth, at a hotel, shop, bookstore, and post office - each specific location has unique characteristics and practices. 1. Ticket Booth: At a ticket booth, typically found at places such as movie theaters, amusement parks, and sports events, the primary purpose is to purchase entry to an event or attraction. Usually, payment is made in the form of money, either cash or card. However, there may be instances when vouchers, coupons, or complimentary passes are given to a clerk at the ticket booth as an alternative to money. These can be used to avail of discounts or as a way of gaining complimentary access to the event or attraction. In such cases, offering something other than money to a clerk at a ticket booth is appropriate. 2. At a Hotel: Hotels offer various services to their guests, often including accommodations, meals, and additional amenities. While most hotel payments are made with money or credit, there might be circumstances where guests redeem reward points, gift certificates, or voucher codes in exchange for products and services. These alternative forms of payment may be accepted by a hotel clerk and can result in paying for a hotel stay or accessing particular services without exchanging money. 3. Shop: In a retail shop, customers typically purchase goods or services with money. However, non-monetary exchanges can also occur through means such as the use of gift cards, store credits, or even bartering in specific situations. These practices, while not commonly expected, can lead to transactions where customers obtain desired products or services without directly paying with cash or card. 4. Bookstore: Similar to a retail shop, customers at a bookstore usually pay for their purchases with money. Nonetheless, alternative methods of payment or exchange can be employed in certain situations, such as redeeming gift cards, book vouchers, loyalty points, or even participating in a book exchange program. These alternatives might come into play when interacting with a bookstore clerk, enabling the acquisition of new reading material or services without a monetary transaction. 5. Post Office: At a post office, customers typically tend to pay for services such as mailing, shipping, and purchasing stamps with money. However, there are specific scenarios where alternative tools can be utilized, such as redeeming postage coupons or offering pre-paid postage material. In such instances, a clerk might accept an item besides money in exchange for the service provided by the post office.

Two neighbors Paul and Dean studied toghether often. this week they got together and Paul started studying about the Gaia hypothesis, while Dean studied Einstein's Theory of Relativity.  Which person studied more about the carbon dioxide levels?  Hint: The Gaia hypothesis states that the biosphere is its own living organism. The hypothesis suggests that the Earth is self-regulating and tends to achieve a stable state, known as homeostasis . For example the composition of our atmosphere stays fairly consistent, providing the ideal conditions for life. When carbon dioxide levels increase in the atmosphere, plants grow more quickly. As their growth continues, they remove more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. In this way, the amount of carbon dioxide stays fairly constant without human intervention.","output":"Based on the given information and hint, it can be inferred that Paul, who studied the Gaia hypothesis, likely studied more about the carbon dioxide levels. This is because the Gaia hypothesis emphasizes a self-regulating Earth, which includes maintaining a stable atmospheric composition and constantly adjusting to maintain the ideal conditions for life to thrive. One of the key aspects of the Gaia hypothesis is its focus on the relationship between the biosphere and the atmosphere. The example provided specifically mentions how the increase in carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere leads to more rapid plant growth, resulting in the removal of more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere to maintain a stable and consistent composition. On the other hand, Dean studied Einstein's Theory of Relativity, which is primarily concerned with the concepts of space and time, as well as the relationship between energy and mass. While this theory has significantly impacted our understanding of physics and the universe, it does not directly relate to carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere or the self-regulation of Earth's systems. Therefore, Paul, who studied the Gaia hypothesis, delved deeper into the topic of carbon dioxide levels and their role in maintaining homeostasis within the Earth's biosphere. This is in comparison to Dean, who studied a subject not directly related to carbon dioxide levels or Earth's homeostasis."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Since 1993 the band's longest serving members are vocalist Karl Buechner, guitarist Scott Crouse, bassist Ian Edwards and drummer Dennis Merrick. Their third guitarist Erick Edwards joined the band in 1998. The band has released eight studio albums, three compilations, two live albums and six music videos. Context: Earth Crisis had a huge impact on both the hardcore punk music and its ideals. MetalSucks said: \\"For anybody who was not in the hardcore scene back then, it is hard to describe the impact they had or how controversial they were. You either loved them or hated them for bringing both metal and veganism into the hardcore scene\\". Sociologist Ross Haenfler stated in The Vinyl Factory that \\"Earth Crisis became the face of straight edge throughout the 1990s\\" through \\"the convergence of 'radical' animal rights activism, a more aggressive 'metalcore' sound, and hardcore crews\\", becoming \\"one of the most controversial bands in the scene's history.\\"  Their albums Firestorm, Destroy the Machines and Gomorrah's Season Ends were particularly influential for the emerging metalcore genre. According to Andrew O'Neill, \\"Earth Crisis inspired a much more heavy metal sound in hardcore\\" and \\"the distinction between the two [genres] started to crumble\\" shortly after those records were released.  To a large extent, Earth Crisis was responsible for the rising of vegan straight edge militancy in the mid- to late 90s, when veganism was rarely present in mainstream culture. Haenfler said that, while \\"earlier straight edge bands advocated vegetarianism - for example Youth of Today, Insted and Manliftingbanner\\", Earth Crisis \\"made animal rights (and environmentalism) central to the scene\\" as a \\"self-described 'vegan straight edge' band\\", \\"inspiring thousands of kids to give up animal products entirely.\\" They also spawned many activists in the scene because their message \\"imparted the sense of urgency in a way that nothing else that ever come before had\\", according to Peter Daniel Young.  Some of their songs went on to be considered by some as anthems, such as \\"Firestorm\\" for straight edge and \\"Ultramilitance\\" for eco-terrorists. They also drew major media attention, having been featured and interviewed by CNN, CBS and The New York Times, while lead singer Karl Buechner was invited to address the Congress about teens and substance abuse. Question: Did they have influence on current culture? Answer:","output":"Yes, Earth Crisis had a significant influence on current culture, especially in the music scene and ideas about animal rights and veganism. They played a big role in shaping the metalcore genre with their albums and inspired a heavier metal sound in hardcore music. They also helped make veganism and animal rights more central to the straight edge and hardcore punk scene, inspiring many people to adopt these beliefs. Their songs became anthems for different movements, and they gained attention from major media outlets, spreading their message even further. So, their influence can be seen in both music and social movements today."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

You probably thought of Google. But Google wasn't always the name of the famous search engine. In fact, the original name was BackRub! BackRub was the name two graduate students gave to the new search engine they developed in 1996. They called it BackRub because the engine used backlinks to measure the popularity of Web sites. Later, they wanted a better name -- a name that suggests huge quantities of data. They thought of the word googol. (A googol is a number followed by 100 zeros.) When they checked the Internet registry of names to see if googol was already taken, one of the students misspelled the word by mistake, and that's how Google was born. Google is just one example of a name change in the business world. Many other companies have decided to change their names or the names of their products. Here are some more examples: Jerry Yang and David Filo, two young computer specialists, developed a guide to Internet content in 1994. They called it \\"Jerry and David's Guide to World Wide Web.\\" But they soon realized that this wasn't a very catchy name, so they searched through a dictionary and found a better one: \\"Yahoo.\\" Sometimes companies change their names because of the popularity of one of their products.

News article: Eight Canadians posted to Cuba have experienced mysterious symptoms such as headaches, dizziness and nose bleeds in recent months, but Global Affairs officials say they are still at a loss to explain what is causing them.      The most recent incident affecting Canadian diplomats and members of their families took place in December. The person affected said they suddenly felt a wave of pressure. Symptoms reported by others have included headaches, dizziness, nose bleeds, loss of balance and sleeplessness. The symptoms reported by the Canadians have not been as severe as those reported by some Americans.      While one person affected continues to experience headaches, Canadian officials said Wednesday there is no indication following medical testing that anyone has experienced permanent damage.      Officials told reporters during a background briefing in Ottawa Wednesday they are in uncharted territory and have never seen anything like it anywhere else in the world. At this point, they said, they haven't ruled out anything, including foul play.      The mysterious ailments, which have triggered speculation worthy of a spy thriller, appear to only be hitting Canadian and American diplomats posted to Havana, Cuba.      U.S. media reported last year that U.S. authorities were investigating the possibility the diplomats and their families had been targeted by some kind of \\"sonic attack.\\" However, The Associated Press on Monday cited a new FBI report that said the U.S. has found no evidence sonic waves were used.      U.S. officials told a congressional hearing Tuesday they are still working on several theories — including the possibility a virus was used.      Canadian officials said there have been no reports of similar symptoms among staff of other embassies or among Cubans. Nor have there been any reports of unusual symptoms among the thousands of Canadian tourists who visit Cuba every year.      The United States reduced the number of people posted to its embassy in response to the problems reported by 24 U.S. personnel and members of their families.      However, Canadian officials said they have no plans to reduce staff at its embassy. While a small number of diplomats and their families have opted to return to Canada, others have been sent to replace them after being fully briefed.      At the same time, the government has increased security measures around both the embassy and the residences of staff members.      Among the aspects officials have been studying are infrasound, ultrasound and environmental factors. While doctors have determined that some of the symptoms could be produced by auditory trauma, they said there is no known sonic weapon.      The U.S. government warns travellers to Cuba that embassy employees have been targeted by attacks and U.S citizens could be as well — particularly around the Hotel Nacional and Hotel Capri in Havana. The Canadian government is not planning to add a similar warning to its travel advisory.      While the officials did not say it, adding a warning to a travel advisory can have significant repercussions for businesses like insurance companies and airlines.      The first reported symptoms occurred in March 2017 but there was a cluster around May 2017 after the Canadian Embassy was approached by the American Embassy and it began to ask staff if they had experienced anything.      Overall, 27 staff members or their family members went through a medical examination and eight received further followup medical treatment.      The government is also doing baseline testing of those being posted to the embassy in Cuba, including those sent there temporarily, to allow them to determine if there are any future changes.      While a number of American staff said they heard a high-pitched sound before they began experiencing symptoms, only one Canadian reported that kind of sound.      The Canadians reported feeling the symptoms at their homes, rather than at the embassy.      Officials said Cuban officials appear to be as puzzled by the strange symptoms as the Canadians and Americans. ||||| Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.      / Updated By Abigail Williams and Tracy Connor      It's not just the U.S. State Department that is baffled by the health problems of diplomats who've worked in Cuba. The Canadian government said Wednesday it also has no idea who or what is behind the mysterious ailments.      At a briefing in Ottawa, a Canadian official said eight of their citizens stationed in Havana, out of 27 tested, required medical care after reporting symptoms that ranged from dizziness and headaches to nosebleeds. Three diplomatic families left Cuba as a result, the official said.      The United States says 24 Americans affiliated with the embassy in Cuba have reported similar symptoms and signs consistent with traumatic brain injury. The State Department recalled all nonemergency personnel in late September and has no plans to return them, straining ties with Cuba.      Cuba has welcomed FBI agents to Havana to investigate. But officials told NBC News that the probe found no evidence of attacks. Additionally, some U.S. officials have questioned whether there's a single cause for the symptoms.      The State Department says the phenomenon is real.      \\"Is there any thought given to the fact that this is a case of mass hysteria? That a bunch of people are just being hypochondriacs and making it up?” Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., asked during a Senate Foreign Relations subcommittee hearing on Tuesday.      \\"Twenty-four people have had symptoms and findings consistent with what looks like a mild traumatic brain injury. The objective tests that were done were not ones that could basically be easily faked,” State Department Medical Director Dr. Charles Rosenfarb testified.      \\"The findings suggest that this is not a case of mass hysteria,\\" he said.      While officials in Washington initially theorized that the staffers and their family members were sickened by some kind of sonic attack, other possible culprits are under investigation.      \\"I think there’s viral, there’s ultrasound, there is a range of things that technical experts are looking at,\\" Todd Brown, diplomatic security assistant director at the State Department, said during the hearing.      \\"When you say viral, you are talking about somebody intentionally implanting a virus?\\" Sen. Tom Udall, D-N.M., asked.      \\"That could be a possibility,\\" Brown said.      Francisco Palmieri of the State Department told a Senate subcommittee it's \\"incomprehensible\\" that Cuba doesn't know who is behind alleged attacks that harmed U.S. and Canadian diplomats. KEVIN LAMARQUE / Reuters      Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has now decided to ratchet up the inquiry and convene an independent panel known as an Accountability Review Board.      At the hearing, Rubio grilled officials on why the board had not been set up earlier, in accordance with law.      \\"The law very clearly requires that within 60 days of an incident, and 120 days at most, that an accountability review board be stood up and they did not do that until almost a year after the first reports of the attacks,” Rubio told reporters. \\"That’s unacceptable.\\"      The Cuban government has vociferously denied any involvement in or knowledge of attacks on American and Canadian diplomats.      \\"There is no evidence of any kind, not of the cause, not of the perpetrators, not of the origin, not of the motivations,\\" a Cuban foreign ministry official, Josefina Vidal Ferreiro, said Tuesday evening. \\"There is no evidence at all, not one piece of evidence.\\"      Despite the lack of evidence, the State Department said it's \\"incomprehensible\\" that leaders in Havana don't know what made the Americans and Canadians sick.      Rubio, an ardent critic of the island's Communist government, agreed.      \\"We can say we don't know how it happened, we can even say we can't know for sure who did it,\\" he said. \\"But two things we know for sure: People were hurt, and the Cuban government knows who did it.\\" ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"Canadian and US diplomats based in Havana, Cuba, have reported mysterious symptoms such as headaches, dizziness and nosebleeds, with no clear explanation for the cause. Eight Canadians have experienced symptoms since March 2017, while 24 Americans have reported similar symptoms, which the US State Department said are consistent with mild traumatic brain injury. Some Cuban-based US personnel were recalled in September 2017, although no diplomats were withdrawn by Canada. Initially suspected to be the result of sonic attacks, the cause of the symptoms is still under investigation, with theories including targeted viruses and environmental factors."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Blank (John Cusack) finds himself depressed and irritable, dissatisfied with his work and the increasing competition from rival assassins, including Grocer (Dan Aykroyd), whose efforts to cartelize the business puts him at potentially lethal odds with the solitary Martin. Following a botched contract, Martin receives an invitation to his 10 year high school reunion in his home town of Grosse Pointe, Michigan. Initially reluctant to attend, he is pressured into it by both his (understandably nervous) therapist (Alan Arkin) and his secretary (Joan Cusack), already booking him for a contract to re-establish ties with a disgruntled client over the botched contract.Upon arriving in Grosse Pointe, Martin seeks out Debi Newberry (Minnie Driver), now a radio DJ, whom Martin had abandoned on prom night to enlist in the Army. While Debi's visit suggests hope for redemption, Martin's subsequent visit to his family only heightens his depression; his father is dead, his mother is an emotionally disturbed resident of a nursing home and his childhood home has been demolished and replaced with a convenience store. Reconnecting with friends like Paul (Jeremy Piven) is likewise depressing, as many have integrated themselves with the local community through mundane establishment jobs. When asked about his livelihood, Martin readily reveals that he is a professional killer, a response taken as a joke by everyone he meets. Meanwhile Martin is being stalked by rival hitmen, including Grocer and Felix LaPoubelle (Benny Urquidez), a Basque terrorist hired to kill him; as well as two awkward National Security Agency agents (Hank Azaria and K.

John comes in and reports the only symptom he has is a rash on his thighs. Patty says she has seen something leaking out of her vagina, and she's not sure what it is. The doctor takes a urine sample from each and will give them the results in a day or two.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Would the complications be more severe for Patty or for John if it is found they have chlamydia?  Hint: Chlamydia may cause a burning feeling during urination. It may also cause a discharge (leaking of fluids) from the vagina or penis. But in many cases it causes no symptoms. As a result, people do not know they are infected, so they don’t go to the doctor for help. If chlamydia goes untreated, it may cause more serious problems in females. It may cause infections of the uterus, fallopian tubes, or ovaries. These infections may leave a woman unable to have children.","output":"Based on the provided information, if it is found that they have chlamydia, the complications would likely be more severe for Patty than for John.

Untreated chlamydia can cause more serious problems in females, such as infections of the uterus, fallopian tubes, or ovaries, potentially resulting in difficulties in conceiving or carrying a pregnancy to term.

The Treaty of San Stefano was signed on 3 March 1878 by Russia and the Ottoman Empire. It was to set up an autonomous Bulgarian principality spanning Moesia, Macedonia and Thrace, roughly on the territories of the Second Bulgarian Empire, and this day is now a public holiday called National Liberation Day. The other Great Powers immediately rejected the treaty out of fear that such a large country in the Balkans might threaten their interests. It was superseded by the Treaty of Berlin, signed on 13 July, which provided for a much smaller state only comprising Moesia and the region of Sofia, leaving large populations of ethnic Bulgarians outside the new country. This significantly contributed to Bulgaria's militaristic foreign affairs approach during the first half of the 20th century.The Bulgarian principality won a war against Serbia and incorporated the semi-autonomous Ottoman territory of Eastern Rumelia in 1885, proclaiming itself an independent state on 5 October 1908. In the years following independence, Bulgaria increasingly militarized and was often referred to as \\"the Balkan Prussia\\". It became involved in three consecutive conflicts between 1912 and 1918—two Balkan Wars and World War I. After a disastrous defeat in the Second Balkan War, Bulgaria again found itself fighting on the losing side as a result of its alliance with the Central Powers in World War I. Despite fielding more than a quarter of its population in a 1,200,000-strong army and achieving several decisive victories at Doiran and Monastir, the country capitulated in 1918. The war resulted in significant territorial losses and a total of 87,500 soldiers killed. More than 253,000 refugees from the lost territories immigrated to Bulgaria from 1912 to 1929, placing additional strain on the already ruined national economy. The answer to this question is:","output":"World War I resulted in significant territorial losses and a total of 87,500 soldiers killed for Bulgaria."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

They have been pondering about how to communicate with each other in a doomsday scenario when all the electronic devices would be useless. They connected their houses with three ducts.  One of the ducts is filled with air; they called it channel A. Another duct is filled with water; they  called it channel B. And the last duct is filled with iron; they called it channel C. They can now transmit sound with these channels of communication; in case, disaster strikes.  Which channel would be faster, channel A or channel B ?  Hint: In common everyday speech, speed of sound refers to the speed of sound waves in air. However, the speed of sound varies from substance to substance: sound travels most slowly in gases; it travels faster in liquids; and faster still in solids. For example, (as noted above), sound travels at 343 m/s in air; it travels at 1,480 m/s in water (4.3 times as fast as in air); and at 5,120 m/s in iron (about 15 times as fast as in air). In an exceptionally stiff material such as diamond, sound travels at 12,000 metres per second (27,000 mph);[1] (about 35 times as fast as in air) which is around the maximum speed that sound will travel under normal conditions. A:","output":"Based on the hint information, it is clear that sound travels faster in different mediums at various speeds.  Step 1: Identify the different speeds of sound in the given mediums. The hint reveals that, in an average circumstance, the speed of sound is 343 m/s in air, 1,480 m/s in water, and 5,120 m/s in iron. Step 2: Compare the necessary mediums for the task. Speed of sound in air (Channel A) = 343 m/s Speed of sound in water (Channel B) = 1,480 m/s Step 3: Determine which is faster. The speed of sound in water (1,480 m/s) is faster than the speed of sound in air (343 m/s). Therefore, for John and Keith, sound would travel faster through channel B (water) than through channel A (air). Thus, in a doomsday scenario, they should ideally use channel B for quicker communication. However, if that's not possible, then channel A will work, though at a slower speed. Remember, this decision is based on the need for speed. Other factors (water evaporation, difficulty in sealing water channel etc.) might influence the final decision which is beyond the scope of the current task."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

By Daily Mail Reporter PUBLISHED: 05:49 EST, 16 May 2012 | UPDATED: 20:16 EST, 16 May 2012 Iran may have used a secret cable published by whistleblower website WikiLeaks to target and hang an alleged Israeli spy. The disturbing development emerged after the alleged spy, kickboxer Majid Jamali Fashi, was executed in Tehran on Tuesday for assassinating an Iranian nuclear scientist in 2010. Although WikiLeaks redacted the name of the intelligence source on a leaked US diplomatic cable, it published a description of him as 'a licensed martial arts coach and trainer', writing from Azerbaijan. Scroll down for video... Experts said they believe the US Embassy document could have raised","output":"suspicions about Fashi, leading Iranian authorities to investigate him further, ultimately resulting in his arrest, trial, and execution. According to Iranian state media, Fashi confessed to being an Israeli Mossad agent responsible for the assassination of the Iranian nuclear scientist. However, human rights organizations have questioned the validity of this confession, suggesting it may have been coerced under torture. The incident has raised concerns among international watchdogs about the potential consequences of publishing sensitive information without thorough redaction. While WikiLeaks has, in the past, brought to light various instances of government misconduct and secrets, it has also faced criticism for potentially endangering individuals' lives by inadvertently revealing their identities. Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, defended the organization's redaction process, arguing that they have an impeccable track record of protecting sources in their releases. However, critics say that Fashi's case highlights the risks associated with disclosing sensitive information and call for stricter guidelines to prevent future incidents. Both Israel and the United States have denied any involvement in Fashi's case, but tensions continue to rise in the region as Iran struggles to maintain control over its nuclear program while facing mounting international pressure to abandon it. In response to this incident, human rights organizations, as well as some foreign governments, have called for an independent investigation into Fashi's arrest, trial, and execution, to determine if his due process rights were violated and whether the information published by WikiLeaks played an unduly influential role in the case. As the repercussions of this tragic turn of events continue to unfold, questions remain about the balance between transparency and the protection of individuals caught in the crosshairs of global politics.

(InStyle.com) -- When \\"The Mary Tyler Moore Show\\" premiered on September 19, 1970, it was almost revolutionary: the first television series focused on an independent (read: unmarried) career girl. And Mary's wardrobe was a little bit revolutionary too -- working women across the country were quick to copy her colorful dresses and wide-legged pantsuits. To celebrate the iconic program's fortieth anniversary, InStyle takes a look back at five fashionable TV shows -- and characters -- that have influenced women's at-work style.  \\"The Mary Tyler Moore Show''  Mary Richards lived in wintry Minneapolis and therefore had no shortage of cute cold-weather staples, including double-breasted coats, knee-high boots, and that famous blue tam.

See all 10 shows that influenced women's at-work wardrobes  \\"Dynasty\\"  Okay, so the Carrington women weren't exactly your typical 9-to-5ers. Nevertheless, the big-shouldered, wasp-waisted creations worn by oil mogul Alexis (Joan Collins) and her longtime rival Krystle (Linda Evans) were popular enough with fans that the show spawned a signature fashion line, \\"The Dynasty Collection\\" which was designed by the show's costumer, Nolan Miller.  \\"Ally McBeal\\"  In 1998, shortly after the show's first season finale, Ally McBeal's disembodied head appeared on the cover of Time magazine along with the question, \\"Is Feminism Dead?\\" Despite the conclusions reached by that article (is it really fair to compare a fictional character to activists and thinkers like Susan B.

Usage: \\"These stories can be difficult due to their length and how each story has at least one of the three following scenarios: the first is when the individual's belief matches reality, the second is when the individual's belief does not match reality, and the third is when an individual has a false belief about another individual's beliefs.\\" - In this example, the first scenario (individual's belief matches reality) is present for Liam looking for the green_pepper, and the third scenario (individual has a false belief about another individual's beliefs) is present for Evelyn and Charlotte regarding the strawberry. This part focuses on identifying which of the three scenarios is relevant to answer the question. Part 3: Analyze the story to determine the characters' beliefs, actions, and the object's location. Usage: \\"William entered the garden... Charlotte entered the cellar.\\" - In this example, you need to follow the story while keeping track of the characters' beliefs and actions to understand when and where the object was moved, and under which scenario the question refers. For Liam, it's about understanding that he doesn't know about William moving the green_pepper. For Evelyn and Charlotte, it's about understanding that Evelyn thinks the strawberry is in the blue_container, but Charlotte doesn't know about the change. Part 4: Combine the understanding of the scenario and the story to answer the question. Usage: \\"Where will Liam look for the green_pepper?\\" and \\"Where does Evelyn think that Charlotte searches for the strawberry?\\" - In this example, you answer by considering the information from previous parts. Liam will look for the green_pepper in the green_suitcase because he doesn't know William moved it. Evelyn thinks that Charlotte searches for the strawberry in the blue_suitcase because she doesn't know Evelyn moved it. This part focuses on providing the answer to the question based on the understanding of the scenario and the story."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

It is a beautiful place that I would highly recommend. I told my family that I was going to go find a port-a-pot. So I head off by myself. I’m in the port-a-pot, i’m in there for roughly 10 minutes. (you can assume what I was doing) I wash my hands and get ready to leave the port-a-pot, and I tried to open the door and it was locked. I’m claustrophobic, so I start to FREAK OUT. I started banging on the door, running into the door with all of my weight. Nothing was helping. I then start crying, I thought for sure that I was going to die. I knew it was the end, at the age of 14, locked in a port-a-pot, in 95 degree weather in the middle of a beach in Georgia. Looking back, i’m curious as to why my family never came to look for me, I was gone for like 30 minutes. So I’m banging on the door continuously, bawling my eyes out. Then a man opened the door for me, from the outside. He was about 6’3 with dreads about 12 inches long and weighed about 280 pounds. I ran out of the port-a-pot and jumped on the guy and gave him a hug and told him that I loved him and that he saved my life. I don’t know how he managed to open the door for me, but I definitely know that my 14 year old self owes that man my life. I’m not sure where he is in life, or what he’s doing, but I hope God is blessing him abundantly. It is definitely a funny story to tell my friends. Question: How strong is the man in dreads? === The answer to the above question is A:","output":"The strength of the man with dreads cannot be accurately determined based solely on the given information. Physical strength is influenced by factors such as muscle mass, body composition, and overall fitness. From the details provided, the man was 6'3\\" tall, weighed about 280 pounds, and had 12-inch long dreads, but these factors alone do not provide enough information to accurately assess his strength. It can be assumed that the man possessed enough strength or knowledge to open the locked port-a-pot door from the outside, but it is important to note that the door may have had a simple mechanism or faulty lock that could have been easily opened even without significant strength.  In addition, the situation was likely very stressful and heightened the emotions of the person trapped inside the port-a-pot, so their perception of the man's strength may be influenced by their extreme relief and gratitude toward the man who saved them.  To accurately determine the man's strength, more information would be needed regarding his muscular development, training background, and any fitness-related accomplishments. It is possible that he was quite strong, but it is also possible that he simply had the knowledge and skills needed to open the locked door. Regardless, his assistance was very much appreciated by the person he helped, and the story serves as a lighthearted anecdote to share with friends."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

After meeting her at an ice hockey match, he sets about winning her confidence until she is prepared to give him legal control over the sale. He completes the deal without her knowledge, puts the money from the sale in a safe deposit box, and then deliberately waits to be caught by the police. Gregory plans on getting a five-year sentence, with time off for good behaviour, and then collecting his loot when he is released. However, the judge makes an example of the uncooperative Gregory by handing down a ten-year term. Not wishing to spend so much time in jail, Gregory pays Victor Sloane, one of his associates on the outside, to help him escape. Almost immediately, things begin to go wrong. Fearing arrest, he is unable for the moment to recover the money from the safe. Sloane also now begins to demand more money, threatening him with violence, and Gregory is forced to retaliate. Gregory tries to get help from his fellow criminals, calling upon an established code that exists between them.

They were already having some problems and without Nonna there anymore to take care of me I think my cousin's house on the coast seemed like as good a spot as any to stick me for the summer. It certainly wasn't because of any great love between me and my cousin. We weren't really very good friends at that point. I think she saw me as sort of foisted off on her and getting in the way of her summers. Which was a fair enough judgment. But she could have been nicer.

Article: If you hear the sound of a handset beeping  in a bag or pocket, you could be forgiven for thinking that someone has received a text message. But nowadays there are so many different ways of messaging someone that it could spell the death of the traditional text as we know it. Text messaging, or texting, is the art of sending a short, electronic message between two mobile phones or tablets . Users pay a certain amount to send messages via  SMS--short message service. But in the last few years, messaging in this way has been on the decline . The rise of smartphones and tablets has seen an increase in the use of instant messaging apps  , which take the place of traditional texts. Using wireless Internet connections, people can send limitless numbers of IMs to their friends for very little cost. Unlike traditional mobile texts, the user usually only has to pay to download the app once, after which each message they send is free. Web developers soon _ . Instant messaging apps have become popular all over the world. WhatsApp in America and Europe, WeChat in China and Kakao Talk in South Korea are but a few which have attracted hundreds of millions of people, who use the apps to chat to their friends in real time.

The band moved to London upon finding fame in 1964. The Animals were known for their gritty, bluesy sound and deep-voiced frontman Eric Burdon, as exemplified by their signature song and transatlantic No. 1 hit single, \\"House of the Rising Sun\\", as well as by hits such as \\"We Gotta Get Out of This Place\\", \\"It's My Life\\", \\"I'm Crying\\" and \\"Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood\\". The band balanced tough, rock-edged pop singles against rhythm and blues-orientated album material. The original Animals line-up of Burdon, Price, Valentine, Chandler and Steel reunited for a benefit concert in Newcastle in December 1968 and re-formed in late 1975 to record again. Burdon later said nobody understood why they did this short reunion. They did a mini-tour in 1976 and shot a few videos of their new songs like \\"Lonely Avenue\\" and \\"Please Send Me Someone to Love\\". They released the album in 1977 aptly called Before We Were So Rudely Interrupted. The album received critical praise. Burdon and Valentine also recorded some demos at that time, which were never released. On 12 December 1982, Burdon performed together with Alan Price and a complete line-up, foreshadowing later events.  All five original band members reunited again in 1983 for the album Ark and a world concert tour, supplemented by Zoot Money on keyboards, Nippy Noya on percussion, Steve Gregory on saxophone and Steve Grant on guitar. The first single \\"The Night\\" reached #48 at the US Pop Singles and #34 at the Mainstream Rock Charts, also gaining success in Greece. They released a second single called \\"Love Is For All Time\\".  The Ark tour consisted of about one-third material from the original 1960s and two-thirds material from Ark or other songs. The latter included the songs \\"Heart Attack\\", \\"No More Elmore\\" (both released a year earlier by Burdon), \\"Oh Lucky Man\\" (from the 1973 soundtrack album to O Lucky Man! by Price), \\"It's Too Late\\", \\"Tango\\", and \\"Young Girls\\" (later released on Burdon's compilation, The Night). On 9 September, they had their first show in New York at the Mid-Hudson Civic Center, the tickets for which sold out. A Wembley Arena concert followed on 31 December (supporting The Police) which was released on the Rip it To Shreds live album in 1984 after they had disbanded again. Their concert at the Royal Oak Theatre in Royal Oak, Michigan on 29 November 1983 was released on 27 February 2008, as Last Live Show. A film about the reunion tour was shot but never released.

The actions, gestures and spoken parts acted out by the puppeteer with the puppet are typically used in storytelling. Puppetry is a very ancient form of theatre which dates back to the 5th century BC in Ancient Greece. There are many different varieties of puppets, and they are made from a wide range of materials, depending on their form and intended use. They range from very simple in construction and operation to very complex.  - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Article:The PM said he was \\"delighted\\" by the result, which  gave the UK a chance to change \\"for the better\\". He said there had to be a \\"fair and balanced\\" settlement with English MPs deciding on laws applying to England. But defeated SNP leader Alex Salmond warned against any delay in shifting powers to Scotland as he announced his decision to step down. \\"For me as leader, my time is nearly done,\\" he said. \\"For Scotland, the campaign continues and the dream shall never die.\\" Scotland's First Minister explained his decision to quit just hours after Scotland voted decisively to stay in the United Kingdom by 2,001,926 votes to 1,617,989 - about 55% to 45%. The vote is the culmination of a two-year campaign. Talks will now begin on devolving more powers to Scotland. BBC political editor Nick Robinson The people have spoken. Scotland has rejected independence. The result has been accepted by both sides. So that you might think is that. Not a bit of it. The fact that over 1.5m British citizens voted not to remain part of the UK, the fact that a majority in Scotland's biggest city - Glasgow - backed independence, the fact that the Westminster establishment briefly thought this vote was lost, is the reason for that. The leaders of the three UK parties are now promising significant constitutional change and not just for Scotland but for England, Wales and Northern Ireland as well. They have agreed on a timetable for giving more powers to the Scottish Parliament but are a long, long way from agreeing proposals. Read more from Nick Robinson. Mr Salmond said he was \\"immensely proud\\" of his Yes campaign and serving as Scotland's First Minister had been \\"the privilege of my life\\", but he conceded that the SNP would benefit from new leadership to take the process on. The party had \\"the opportunity to hold Westminster's feet to the fire on the 'vow' that they have made to devolve further meaningful power to Scotland,\\" he said. \\"This places Scotland in a very strong position.\\" But while he would continue to serve as MSP for Aberdeenshire East, he had decided to stand down after the party's annual conference in November. \\"We lost the referendum vote but can still carry the political initiative,\\" he said. \\"More importantly Scotland can still emerge as the real winner.\\" In a statement outside Downing Street Mr Cameron defended the decision to hold the referendum, saying it was right that the SNP's majority in Holyrood was respected. He said Lord Smith of Kelvin had agreed to oversee the process of devolving more powers over tax, spending and welfare to Scotland, with draft legislation by the end of January. Mr Cameron added that the rights of other people in the UK needed to be \\"respected and enhanced\\". He said he had long believed that a crucial missing part was England. He said \\"the millions of voices of England must be heard\\". The Leader of the Commons William Hague has been asked to draw up plans for what would be a fundamental change at Westminster - that only English MPs could vote on English matters. BBC deputy political editor James Landale The Downing Street constitutional declaration - as it will become known - marks the start of what potentially could be massive constitutional change. In particular, the prime minister has promised to give English MPs a greater say over legislation that affects England. He made clear this would cover the same issues over which Scotland will have greater control - tax, spending and welfare. And the changes will be agreed at the same pace with draft legislation by January. But David Cameron did not spell out the detail, leaving a policy vacuum that will now be filled by Conservative MPs and an army of constitutional experts and think tanks. Everything from a full English parliament to complicated plans for English grand committees will be discussed. The risk for the PM is that he loses control of this debate. Read more from James Landale Mr Hague insisted there was a \\"very clear commitment\\" to the Scottish reforms pledged by the three main UK parties, but he argued that the English question had to be resolved at the same pace. \\"I think it would be inconceivable to go ahead with a further important stage and measure of devolution to parts of the United Kingdom, without addressing this issue,\\" he told the BBC. \\"Of course it's been an anomaly for quite a long time now that Scottish MPs can vote on everything happening in England, but we the English MPs can no longer do so in Scotland, and indeed nor can the Scottish. \\"But it will become absolutely acute - it will become absolutely indefensible with further devolution - and I think people need to know at the time of the general election next May where we all stand on that, whether we've tried to reach an agreement, and if not, it's something they can decide on in the general election.\\" 'History made' BBC political correspondent Iain Watson said the proposal to restrict voting rights for Scottish MPs could undermine a future Labour government - theoretically there could be a Labour PM who lacks a majority of English MPs so is unable to get health or education issues through parliament. But Labour leader Ed Miliband, arriving at his party's conference in Manchester, said he would not allow the moment \\"to be used for narrow party political advantage\\". Instead he announced plans for a full constitutional convention \\"rooted in our nations and regions... to ensure decisions are taken closer to the families and businesses\\". \\"These issues can no longer be fixed solely by politicians or prime ministers trying to shore up their position in their own party,\\" he said. \\"The people need to be given a voice too.\\" He did not comment on proposals for English-only votes in Parliament, instead calling for more powers to be devolved to regions within England. 'Rash promises' Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg said it was time for the \\"clammy grip\\" of Westminster and Whitehall to be released \\"so that communities, families, cities, towns and villages across the UK feel that they have more say over their destiny than is currently the case\\". Mayor of London Boris Johnson said the result was \\"a great day for Britain\\" and pressed the case for English devolution. \\"What is sauce for the goose has got to be sauce for the gander,\\" he added. Meanwhile, Conservative MP Owen Paterson, who was sacked by Mr Cameron as environment secretary in July, demanded an immediate recall of Parliament to debate a new constitutional settlement. He said it had been \\"completely unacceptable that right at the end of the campaign we have an ex-Labour leader (Gordon Brown) galloping off up to Scotland making some very rash promises of extensive new powers to the Scottish people - apparently with the endorsement of all three UK party leaders.\\" England's voice Conservative Bernard Jenkin said he supported English votes for English laws, but claimed Mr Cameron's \\"No\\" campaign had been \\"patronising, over bearing,\\" and had given very little clarity about the implications of independence - \\"just rather a lot of scare stories\\". Ex-Labour minister Frank Field urged the Labour leadership to come up with its own answer to the \\"English question\\" as soon as possible, warning that the party could not afford to drag its heels or be seen as \\"anti-English\\". UKIP leader Nigel Farage said it was now time for a \\"constitutional convention to find out how a fair UK would work\\". \\"I think England needs a voice,\\" he said. \\"We've heard a lot from Scotland. The tail can't continue wagging the dog any longer. We must have English MPs voting on English only matters.\\" Graham Brady, chairman of the Conservative MPs' 1922 Committee, said he could envisage parliament having English-only days - when English MPs vote on English matters. Speaking to the BBC's Newsnight programme, he said a separate English parliament could be costly and bureaucratic, but one parliament could sit on different days of the week for different matters.

The film begins with Naomi Arkoff being taken by her father Carver Arkoff into the basement of their castle home in Rome, Italy, where there lies a rack. Carver ties Naomi to both ends of the rack and turns the wheel, hurting her. Carver claims that her punishment this time is for having a cell phone, which was against the father's wishes. After begging her father to let her go, Carver unties her, but warns her that the next time she has a cellphone in the house, her punishment is not going to be slow and painful. As she gets released, she runs off upstairs, strangely screaming: \\"I can run faster than you!\\" over and over again.

Answer the following question: Given the below context:  Pulakeshin II conquered the eastern Deccan, corresponding to the coastal districts of modern Andhra Pradesh in 616, defeating the remnants of the Vishnukundina kingdom. He appointed his brother Kubja Vishnuvardhana as Viceroy in 621. Thus the Eastern Chalukyas were originally of Kannada stock. After the death of Pulakeshin II, the Vengi Viceroyalty developed into an independent kingdom and included the region between Nellore and Visakhapatnam.After the decline of the Badami Chalukya empire in the mid-8th century, territorial disputes flared up between the Rashtrakutas, the new rulers of the western deccan, and the Eastern Chalukyas. For much of the next two centuries, the Eastern Chalukyas had to accept subordination towards the Rashtrakutas. Apart from a rare military success, such as the one by Vijayaditya II(c.808–847), it was only during the rule of Bhima I (c.892–921) that these Chalukyas were able to celebrate a measure of independence. After the death of Bhima I, the Andhra region once again saw succession disputes and interference in Vengi affairs by the Rashtrakutas.The fortunes of the Eastern Chalukyas took a turn around 1000. Danarnava, their king, was killed in battle in 973 by the Telugu Choda King Bhima who then imposed his rule over the region for twenty-seven years. During this time, Danarnava's two sons took refuge in the Chola kingdom. Choda Bhima's invasion of Tondaimandalam, a Chola territory, and his subsequent death on the battlefield opened up a new era in Chola–Chalukya relations. Saktivarman I, the elder son of Danarnava was crowned as the ruler of Vengi in 1000, though under the control of king Rajaraja Chola I. This new relationship between the Cholas and the coastal Andhra kingdom was unacceptable to the Western Chalukyas, who had by then replaced the Rashtrakutas as the main power in the western Deccan. The Western Chalukyas sought to brook the growing Chola influence in the Vengi region but were unsuccessful.Initially, the Eastern Chalukyas had encouraged Kannada language and...

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who served in the Senate from his appointment in 1964 until becoming Vice President in 1977? ?  Hubert Humphrey was a Minnesotan who became a nationally prominent politician. He first ran for mayor of Minneapolis in 1943, but lost the election to the Republican candidate by just a few thousand votes.  As a Democrat, Humphrey recognized that his best chance for political success was to obtain the support of the Minnesota Farmer-Labor Party.  Other members of the Farmer-Labor Party had been considering the idea, as encouraged by Franklin D. Roosevelt, but the merger only became reality after Humphrey traveled to Washington, D.C. to discuss the issue.  Rather than simply absorbing the Farmer-Labor party, with its constituency of 200,000 voters, Humphrey suggested calling the party the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party.  He was elected mayor of Minneapolis in 1945, and one of his first actions was to propose an ordinance making racial discrimination by employers subject to a fine.  This ordinance was adopted in 1947, and although few fines were issued, the city's banks and department stores realized that public relations would improve by hiring blacks in increasing numbers. Humphrey delivered an impassioned speech at the 1948 Democratic National Convention encouraging the party to adopt a civil rights plank in their platform.  He was elected to the United States Senate in 1948 and was re-elected in 1954 and 1960.In the early 1960s, the topic of civil rights was coming to national prominence with sit-ins and marches organized by Martin Luther King Jr. and other black leaders.  In 1963, President John F. Kennedy sent a comprehensive civil rights bill to Congress, based largely on the ideas that Humphrey had been placing before the Senate for the previous fifteen years.  The bill passed the House in early 1964, but passage through the Senate was more difficult, due to southern segregationists who filibustered for 75 days.  Finally, in June 1964, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 became law.  Humphrey called this his greatest achievement. Lyndon B.

Write highlights for this article: Stocks on key Asian exchanges dropped modestly early Monday on what is likely to be an eventful day in world markets, following Standard and Poor's downgrade of the U.S. credit rating. In early Tokyo trading, the Nikkei index fell 124 points, or 1.3%. South Korea's KOSPI index slipped 1.6%. In Australia, the All Ordinaries index lost 0.7%. The Shanghai composite started 0.8% lower. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index tumbled 2.6% at the open. Similarly, U.S. stock futures fell around 1.7% in early electronic trading Sunday. The futures were the first U.S. gauge of investor sentiment following Friday night's downgrade, removing the United States' AAA status for the first time. They give an indication of how investors will react when regular-hours U.S. trading begins at 9:30 a.m. ET Monday. Besides the U.S. downgrade, investors are concerned about the debt crisis in some European nations, though actions on the part of the G7 and the European Central Bank Sunday helped to allay some of those fears. Financial representatives of leading industrial nations said they are committed to taking \\"all necessary measures to support financial stability and growth in a spirit of close cooperation and confidence.\\" They welcomed the \\"decisive actions taken in the U.S. and Europe\\" and \\"the additional policy measures announced by Italy and Spain to strengthen fiscal discipline and underpin the recovery in economic activity and job creation.\\" \\"We are committed to taking coordinated action where needed, to ensuring liquidity, and to supporting financial market functioning, financial stability and economic growth,\\" G7 finance ministers and central bank governors said in a Sunday night statement. Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner had been expected to take part in a conference call with representatives of the other G7 nations to discuss the downgraded U.S. credit rating, a G7 official told CNN. The G7 nations are the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Canada and the United States. Similarly, the European Central Bank made a bid to calm markets Sunday. It said it would implement a bond-purchase program and welcomed announcements by Italy and Spain on new measures meant to reduce their deficits. It told the governments of those countries that a \\"decisive and swift implementation\\" of reforms is \\"essential.\\" The move represents an escalation in the official response to Europe's debt crisis, which is now more than a year old and until recently was contained to smaller economies like Greece, Ireland and Portugal. International Monetary Fund Managing Director Christine Lagarde cheered the announcements. \\"I welcome the statements from the European Central Bank, from the leaders of Germany and France as well as from the G7, and their renewed commitment to take all necessary action in a coordinated way to ensure stability and liquidity in the financial markets. This cooperation will contribute to maintaining confidence and spurring global economic growth,\\" she said in a statement. Middle Eastern markets, the first to open since the downgrade, were sharply lower on Sunday. Israel's market temporarily halted trading at one point and finished down more than 6%, while the Dubai Financial Market General Index fell 3.7%. The General Index on the Abu Dhabi Securities Exchange was down more than 2.5%, while in Saudi Arabia, the Tadawul All-Share Index dropped nearly 5.5% in trading Saturday. U.S. officials are talking to a \\"wide range of investors\\" about the downgrade by the credit agency to try to \\"mitigate\\" any short-term negative impact from Friday's announcement, a Treasury official told CNN. Top Standard & Poor's officials said Sunday that the downgraded credit rating for the United States was both a call for political consensus on significant deficit reduction and a warning of possible further credit problems down the road. \\"We have a negative outlook on the rating and that means that we think the risks currently on the rating are to the downside,\\" said David Beers, the S&P global head of sovereign ratings, on \\"Fox News Sunday.\\" However, Beers said markets were reacting to the debt crises in some European countries and fears of a global economic slump, rather than the U.S. credit downgrade alone. John Chambers, the S&P head of sovereign ratings, told ABC's \\"This Week\\" program Saturday that it could take years for the United States to return to AAA status. \\"Well, if history is a guide, it could take a while,\\" Chambers said. \\"We've had five governments that lost their AAA that got it back. The amount of time that it took for those five range from nine years to 18 years, so it takes a while.\\" The agency's concerns \\"are centered on the political side and on the fiscal side,\\" Chambers said. \\"So it would take a stabilization of the debt as a share of the economy and eventual decline,\\" he said. \\"And it would take, I think, more ability to reach consensus in Washington than what we're observing now.\\" Both Beers and Bill Miller, chairman and chief investment officer at Legg Mason Capital Management, told the Fox program that they don't expect the U.S. downgrade to cause a spike in interest rates, one of the possible results of the higher risk now attached to U.S. debt. \\"I don't think we'll pay more in interest,\\" Miller said, calling the downgrade more of a symbolic event than an economic event. However, he warned of continuing market volatility in coming days driven by uncertainty. Rating agencies such as S&P, Moody's and Fitch analyze risk and give debt a grade that is supposed to reflect the borrower's ability to repay its loans. The safest bets are stamped AAA. That's where the U.S. debt has stood for years. Moody's first assigned the United States an AAA rating in 1917. Fitch and Moody's, the other two main credit ratings agencies, maintained the AAA rating for the United States after last week's debt deal, though Moody's lowered its outlook on U.S. debt to \\"negative.\\" A negative outlook indicates the possibility that Moody's could downgrade the country's sovereign credit rating within a year or two. U.S. Treasury officials received S&P's analysis Friday afternoon and alerted the agency to an error that inflated U.S. deficits by 2 trillion, said an administration official, who was not authorized to speak for attribution. The agency acknowledged the mistake, but said it was sticking with its decision. The administration official called it \\"a facts-be-damned decision ... Their analysis was way off, but they wouldn't budge.\\" Saturday, Gene Sperling, director of Obama's National Economic Council, criticized S&P's call. \\"The magnitude of their error and the amateurism it displayed, combined with their willingness to simply change on the spot their lead rationale in their press release once the error was pointed out, was breathtaking. It smacked of an institution starting with a conclusion and shaping any arguments to fit it,\\" he said. But Beers defended his agency's move on Sunday, telling the Fox program: \\"The underlying debt burden of the U.S. government is rising and will continue to rise over the next decade.\\" CNN's Tom Cohen, Kyung Lah and Mark Meinero contributed to this report. Highlights:","output":"1. Stocks in Asia fell after the US credit rating was downgraded by Standard and Poor's. 2. US stock futures also fell by 1.7% in early trading, showing that investors were worried. 3. The G7 and the European Central Bank took actions to support financial stability and growth. 4. Middle Eastern markets went down too, with some losing more than 5% of their value. 5.

Being a cheerleader demands a far more considerable enthusiasm than just donning a colorful uniform and having the ability to move one's feet rhythmically. It's a role that carries its unique set of challenges and rewards, often overlooked in the broader landscape of sports. A cheerleader's role in any sport is highly significant, and their uniform is a vibrant reflection of their team spirit and identity. Unfailingly bright, coordinated, and perfectly accessorized, the cheerleader uniform is much more than an ensemble; it's a sportswear specifically designed to accommodate agile moves and daring stunts. It's an embodiment of the dynamic energy and optimistic ethos that a cheerleader brings to a game. Made to be comfortable and allow freedom of movement, the uniform enables cheerleaders to perform their high-energy routines, all the while flaunting their team's colors and logos. The uniform, thus, symbolizes identity, team spirit, resilience, and undying enthusiasm. It encapsulates the powerful aesthetic that cheerleading brings to sports. Its importance is such that many sports teams invest significant resources into making these uniforms visually impressive, resonating with their audience, be it in basketball, football, or any other popular team sport.  One of the primary tasks of a cheerleader during the game is to move - through coordination, grace, and rhythm. The feet play a crucial role in this. They should be swift enough to carry the cheerleader's weight through various routines, from simple toe-touch jumps to complex gymnastic tossing or tumbling sequences. Moreover, cheerleading often involves a series of lifts and human pyramids where the solid positioning of the feet is a matter of safety and efficiency. So, the feet's function in cheerleading is paramount; it provides rhythm, balance, speed, and most importantly, safety. Being a cheerleader in the world of sports is not merely about looking glamorous in a uniform or mastering the movements of one's feet. It's about portraying the spirit of unity, building an atmosphere of positivity, rallying the crowd, and supporting the team. It's about embodying resilience, enthusiasm, discipline, athleticism, and a great love for the game in equal measure. Thus, cheerleading is not just a sideshow to the main game; it's equally as essential and integral to the sport as the athletes themselves.  They are the ones who set the stage for the players, amplify the crowd's emotions, celebrate team's success, and even offer solace in defeat by always staying optimistic and hopeful. Cheerleaders, with their vivacious uniforms and nimble feet, bring joy, color, and spirited aesthetics to sports, making the competition not just a game, but an all-encompassing spectacle of human endeavor, resilience, and unity."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the question: Article: Traffic problems are an everyday concern in many cities,including Washington,DC.A growing number of Washingtonians are turning to bicycles to get to and from work.In fact,the number of commuters who use bicycles has doubled in the city since 2007. Ralph Buehler teaches urban planning at the Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University,popularly known as Virginia Tech.He has written a book about urban biking,called \\"City Cycling\\". He says there is a reason why urban bike tiding is now becoming more popular. \\"Over the last 60 to 70 years.cities in the U.S.have been adapted to the automobile.\\" \\"Most cities took advantage of the money coming for the interstate highway system,from the federal government,starting in 1956.There was a 90 percent federal match so the cities only had to put up 10%.It was very tempting.\\" In the years after World War Two,many Americans moved to suburban communities,just outside major cities,They decided to travel great distances to and from work in exchange for a home in the suburbs.Their cars became a symbol of freedom.  But today,many people believe they can save money by living in the city.  Greg Billing is with the Washington Area Bicyclist Association.\\"When a person makes a change from 04 using a car to using a bike,they are saving anywhere between 8 or9,000 a year.\\"  Ralph Buehler says governments save money when people use bicycles.\\"Building bicycling facilities is much cheaper than building and maintaining road facilities or public transport.\\" Washington,DC has also taken steps to protect bike riders.It approved a safe passing law and created areas on the road between cars and bikes. The United States Census Bureau says 4%of the city's workers ride to work by bike.The only city on the East Coast with more bike commuters is New York. Question: What's the best title of the text?

Israeli police arrested two suspects Saturday in connection to a deadly wildfire raging in the country's north, though a police spokesman said it appears the fires started out of negligence. The fires have killed 41 and injured 17 others. Police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld said the suspects are being questioned at a local police station but police now believe the fires were due to negligence rather than arson. As the police probe unfolded, firefighters continued to battle three major blazes fueled by shifting winds. The fire, the worst in Israel's history, is still not under control, Rosenfeld said. The flames spread over 10,000 acres around Haifa, Israel's third largest city, threatening businesses, tourism and one of Israel's greenest regions, Mount Carmel. \\"If you look over the hills at Haifa, you can see smoke billowing over the sea,\\" said Rosenfeld, adding that the winds have forced authorities to close down roads to the coastal area. About 17,000 people have been evacuated, but residential areas are not under threat, he said. On Saturday, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu referred to the help Israel received from other nations, including Egypt, Turkey and Jordan, as \\"heartwarming,\\" the Jerusalem Post reported. \\"One thing is clear, the Israeli people are standing together and many, many countries are together with Israel. This is no small thing,\\" Netanyahu said during a press conference. \\"This is surely a point of light in this our festival of lights Hanukkah,\\" he said. Israeli's military noted in a statement Saturday that firefighters from Bulgaria and Greece had joined Israeli personnel on the blaze's frontlines. Netanyahu's office said that so far, several nations have committed 10 airplanes and three helicopters to help Israel fight the raging fire, including four from Greece, one from Cyprus, two from Turkey, two from Russia and one from France. These are in addition to several Israel Defense Forces aircraft, including two to four charged with surveying the region from above. British Prime Minister David Cameron instructed the Royal Air Force to deploy two helicopters from Cyprus to help put out the fire, British Foreign Secretary William Hague said Friday. Netanyahu spoke Saturday morning with the president of Switzerland to recruit additional air support, his office said. Five U.S. Defense Department aircraft will leave for Israel this weekend to help fight the fire. They include three C-130 firefighting aircraft from the U.S. Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard and two C-130s from the U.S. European Command, which will depart Ramstein Air Base in Germany carrying 20 tons of fire retardant, the U.S. Agency for International Development said. The agency said it has already chartered commercial aircraft to deliver 45 tons of fire retardant and 12,000 liters of foam to suppress the flames. A team of experts from the U.S. Forest Service's Disaster Assistance Support Program is also heading to Israel, the agency said. Hague expressed his condolences to the families of the victims and to the thousands who have had to be evacuated because of the blaze. \\"This tragedy is all the more sad as it comes as the Jewish community around the world celebrates Hanukkah, a time of hope and joy,\\" Hague said. \\"The UK will continue to do whatever it can to help.\\" Two funerals took place Saturday after another eight were held Friday for those killed, Rosenfeld said. Most of the 41 victims were cadets in Israel's prison service who arrived Thursday to help evacuate 500 inmates from the Damon prison near Haifa. Among the dead, 40 were apparently burned alive when their bus, traveling along a narrow mountain road, was engulfed by the fast-moving blaze, the Jerusalem Post reported. In an interview with the newspaper, a firefighter spokesman said the bus was gone in less than three minutes. \\"The bus had no chance. They tried to escape but were burned alive,\\" the spokesman said. \\"It was a horrific scene.\\" The IDF said the victims will be buried with full honors in military ceremonies. Israeli firefighter spokesman Yoram Levy said shifting 29 kph (18 mph) winds made the inferno harder to control as flames neared a neighborhood in Haifa, a major tourist destination on the northern coast. Built on the slopes of Mount Carmel about 50 miles north of Tel Aviv, Haifa's metropolitan area is also host to historical sites that date to Biblical times. The fire has also threatened a sensitive ecological area near the Hai Bar nature reserve. Known as Mount Carmel's \\"Little Switzerland,\\" the reserve is home to a wildlife preservation project that seeks to bring back native species mentioned in the Old Testament. Though Israel is known for its military might, it has been criticized for failing to properly handle the blazes. CNN's Paul Colsey contributed to this report.

Herbert Alexander Simon (June 15, 1916 - February 9, 2001) was an American economist and political scientist whose primary interest was decision-making within organizations and is best known for the theories of \\"bounded rationality\\" and \\"satisficing\\". He received the Nobel Prize in Economics in 1978 and the Turing Award in 1975. His research was noted for its interdisciplinary nature and spanned across the fields of cognitive science, computer science, public administration, management, and political science. He was at Carnegie Mellon University for most of his career, from 1949 to 2001. Simon was a pioneer in the field of artificial intelligence, creating with Allen Newell the Logic Theory Machine (1956) and the General Problem Solver (GPS) (1957) programs. GPS may possibly be the first method developed for separating problem solving strategy from information about particular problems. Both programs were developed using the Information Processing Language (IPL) (1956) developed by Newell, Cliff Shaw, and Simon. Donald Knuth mentions the development of list processing in IPL, with the linked list originally called \\"NSS memory\\" for its inventors. In 1957, Simon predicted that computer chess would surpass human chess abilities within \\"ten years\\" when, in reality, that transition took about forty years.  In the early 1960s psychologist Ulric Neisser asserted that while machines are capable of replicating \\"cold cognition\\" behaviors such as reasoning, planning, perceiving, and deciding, they would never be able to replicate \\"hot cognition\\" behaviors such as pain, pleasure, desire, and other emotions. Simon responded to Neisser's views in 1963 by writing a paper on emotional cognition, which he updated in 1967 and published in Psychological Review. Simon's work on emotional cognition was largely ignored by the artificial intelligence research community for several years, but subsequent work on emotions by Sloman and Picard helped refocus attention on Simon's paper and eventually, made it highly influential on the topic.  Simon also collaborated with James G. March on several works in organization theory.  With Allen Newell, Simon developed a theory for the simulation of human problem solving behavior using production rules. The study of human problem solving required new kinds of human measurements and, with Anders Ericsson, Simon developed the experimental technique of verbal protocol analysis. Simon was interested in the role of knowledge in expertise. He said that to become an expert on a topic required about ten years of experience and he and colleagues estimated that expertise was the result of learning roughly 50,000 chunks of information. A chess expert was said to have learned about 50,000 chunks or chess position patterns.  He was awarded the ACM Turing Award, along with Allen Newell, in 1975. \\"In joint scientific efforts extending over twenty years, initially in collaboration with J. C. (Cliff) Shaw at the RAND Corporation, and subsequentially [sic] with numerous faculty and student colleagues at Carnegie Mellon University, they have made basic contributions to artificial intelligence, the psychology of human cognition, and list processing.\\" Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: Were these programs used by others later on?","output":"The text does not provide specific details about whether the programs developed by Herbert Alexander Simon, such as the Logic Theory Machine (1956) and the General Problem Solver (GPS) (1957), were directly used by others later on. However, Simon's influence on the fields of cognitive science, computer science, and artificial intelligence is well established, suggesting that his work, including the programs he helped develop, have had a significant impact on subsequent research in these fields. His development of the Information Processing Language (IPL) with Allen Newell and the linked list, known as \\"NSS memory,\\" are significant contributions to list processing and program development. Simon's input into the development of artificial intelligence suggests his programs' methodologies and principles have likely been utilised or built-upon in subsequent AI explorations and developments."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

However, given the context, it is possible to suggest a few potential scenarios that may take place as a result of the ongoing pain they are experiencing. Here are a few possibilities: 1. Visiting a doctor or medical professional: The most likely next step for the narrator could be to consult with a doctor, nurse, or other medical professional to address and diagnose the pain they have been experiencing. This would allow them to receive professional guidance on how to manage and treat their pain effectively, ultimately improving their quality of life. Additionally, a medical professional could discern if there are any serious underlying issues at play that may be contributing to their pain. 2. Seeking pain management options: If the narrator has not already done so, they may be considering investing time into researching and exploring various pain management techniques to alleviate their discomfort. This could include over-the-counter medications, prescription painkillers, or alternative methods like physiotherapy, acupuncture, chiropractic care, and massage therapy. Ultimately, they might be seeking ways to gain more control over their pain and improve their overall well-being. 3. Exploring lifestyle adjustments: The narrator may be reflecting on their current lifestyle and contemplating possible changes that could help alleviate their pain or prevent it from escalating. This could involve improving their diet, incorporating gentle exercise routines, adjusting their sleep habits, or practicing relaxation techniques such as meditation and deep breathing exercises. By identifying potential lifestyle factors that could be exacerbating their pain, the narrator may be able to make meaningful adjustments to lessen their discomfort. 4. Discussing their situation with friends or family members: Another possible direction the narrator might take is sharing their pain experiences with close friends or family members. This could provide emotional support and help them navigate their way through the challenges that living with chronic pain can present. They may gain helpful insights from others who have faced similar circumstances or receive recommendations for reputable healthcare providers, treatments, or support groups. 5. Reevaluating their daily activities: The narrator might assess their daily activities to determine if any specific actions are contributing to or exacerbating their pain. Identifying and modifying these activities could lead to decreased pain levels and increased comfort throughout the day. Of course, these possibilities are merely speculative, as the narrator's next steps would ultimately depend on their individual situation, preferences, and access to resources. And while it is unclear precisely where they may be heading next, one thing remains certain: addressing and managing their pain will likely be a priority as they strive to improve their quality of life."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Security forces and emergency services were quick to respond, but they could not save the victims this time. This recent escalation of violence highlights the need for stronger security measures and continuous efforts by local governments to curb such occurrences. The explosions occurred in quick succession, causing chaos and panic among residents who had already been dealing with the ongoing tension in the area. While the cause of these blasts has not been officially confirmed, it is believed that extremist groups might be behind this ruthless act. The investigation is currently underway and authorities are working around the clock to identify those responsible and bring them to justice. These events have led to increased fear and uncertainty among locals, affecting their daily lives and overall well-being. The government has recognized the need for heightened security measures and has promised to review and strengthen its security protocols. Additionally, the need for better coordination between various security agencies has been emphasized to ensure a seamless flow of information and a quicker response to potential threats. The string of blasts has also urged the government to put more efforts into understanding and fighting the root causes of extremism and violence in the region. Community engagement and programs aimed at identifying potential extremists will play a crucial role in preventing further attacks and loss of innocent lives. As the people of Southern Philippines continue to mourn the loss of their loved ones, the government and security forces are working diligently to ensure that these tragedies do not go unpunished.

By contrast, tree leaves falling on the forest floor are the principal source of soil organic matter in the forest.

During the spring of 1976, 30-year-old Vince Papale goes to a sandlot one night and joins his friends playing a pick-up practice football game against another group of young men. After the game ends, Papale goes home and finds out that his wife Sharon is upset with his alleged failure to provide proper support. The next morning, Papale goes to the high school where he works as a substitute teacher. In a short, unexpected meeting with the principal, he is told of his layoff. Later in the day, there is a report that the Eagles have hired a new head coach named Dick Vermeil as shown in a formal televised conference. That night, Papale goes to the bar where he works as a part-time bartender. The bar contains die-hard Eagles fans, who are watching TV about the hiring of Vermeil. The news story concludes with the announcement by Vermeil that he is staging open public tryouts for the Eagles. The men in the bar encourage Papale to go to the tryout. When Papale returns home, he finds out that his wife has left him and a note from her saying he will never be anything in the world. Papale becomes disgusted, smashing the few remaining belongings that Sharon left behind. When Papale goes to the bar next night, he meets a new co-bartender, Janet Cantrell, who (being from New York) is a Giants fan.

Movie title: Public Enemies Movie plot: The film opens in 1933 as John Dillinger (Johnny Depp) is brought to the Indiana State Prison by his partner John \\"Red\\" Hamilton (Jason Clarke), under the disguise of a prisoner drop (with Dillinger posing as the prisoner). Inside the prison, several gang members, Charles Makley (Christian Stolte), Harry Pierpont (David Wenham), Ed Shouse (Michael Vieau), Homer Van Meter (Stephen Dorff), and Walter Dietrich (James Russo) acquire guns smuggled into the prison inside boxes of thread sent to the prison's shirt factory, with which they take a few guards hostage and march them to the changing rooms. At the same time, the warden that meets Dillinger and Hamilton suddenly recognizes Dillinger. Dillinger admits to his identity, and at this point, he suddenly springs his handcuffs off, and he and Hamilton conjure shotguns and force the warden to open the door to the break room at gunpoint, at the moment that the other inmates come in. They force the guards to take off their uniforms at gunpoint. Everything goes as planned until Shouse suddenly beats a guard to death in a fit of rage and another guard gets shot. A running shootout ensues as the men run towards the waiting car. Unfortunately, a sniper on the wall shoots Dietrich in the back just as he is about to get into the car, mortally wounding him, and a furious Dillinger kicks Shouse out of the car.In East Liverpool, Ohio, Melvin Purvis (Christian Bale) and several other FBI agents are running down Pretty Boy Floyd (Channing Tatum). As Floyd sprints through an apple orchard, Purvis aims a rifle at him, fires one round, and misses, as Floyd fires back a burst from his Thompson submachine gun. Purvis sets his sights, aims, and fires again. The bullet goes straight through Floyd's chest and mortally wounds him.Meanwhile, Dillinger's gang reaches a hideout, where crooked Chicago cop Martin Zarkovich (John Michael Bolger) convinces them to hide out in Chicago, where they can be sheltered by the Mafia. Dillinger exchanges brief words with a Mafia car dealer and close...","output":"In the movie Public Enemies, John Dillinger is arrested in Tucson, Arizona, after a fire breaks out at the hotel where he and his gang are staying. The local police officers recognize Dillinger and the other gang members from their wanted posters and manage to apprehend them. Later, Dillinger is extradited to Indiana and held at the Lake County Jail in Crown Point. The film is directed by Michael Mann and tells the story of John Dillinger, a notorious American bank robber and Public Enemy Number One during the Great Depression era. As you mentioned, the plot revolves around Dillinger and his gang's crime spree, as well as the pursuit of Dillinger by FBI Agent Melvin Purvis, played by Christian Bale. Public Enemies offers a mix of action, drama, and engaging performances, especially from Johnny Depp as John Dillinger. The film received generally positive reviews, with many critics praising Depp's portrayal of Dillinger and the movie's realistic portrayal of the 1930s era. However, it's essential to consider a few factors before deciding to invest in a film: 1. The overall budget and potential return on investment: Public Enemies had a budget of around 100 million. It earned approximately 214 million at the box office worldwide, making it a profitable, but not an overwhelming success. Investing in similar projects may offer reasonable returns, but they can be risky due to the high production costs. 2. The market for period dramas: Movies set in historical periods such as Public Enemies can garner interest from audiences craving authentically portrayed settings and characterizations, bolstering the film's chances at the box office. However, the relevance of this particular historical era and its appeal to contemporary audiences should also be taken into account. 3. The filmmakers and actors involved: Michael Mann is an acclaimed director known for movies like Heat and Collateral. Johnny Depp and Christian Bale are both A-list actors who attract large audiences. Their involvement in future film projects could be favorable for potential investors. 4. The competition: Analyzing the movie landscape during the time of production and release is essential. Public Enemies was released in the summer of 2009 amidst films like Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, and Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs. Significant competition can affect the potential success of a project, making in-depth research on the expected release window crucial. Taking all of these factors into consideration, you may decide if investing in a film proposal similar to Public Enemies would be worth it. While the film itself garnered positive reviews and was profitable, it's essential to thoroughly research and analyze the specific details of the project you are considering before making any financial commitment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: I'm a blind teenager girl, but I am ashamed of it if it is known.  I refuse to use a white stick and hate asking for help, and I couldn't bear people to look at me and think I am not like them.  I must be a terrible danger on the roads. Coming across me wandering through the traffic, motorists probably would have to step rapidly on their brakes. Apart from that, there are all sorts of disasters that used to occur on the way to and from work. One evening, I got off the bus about halfway home where I had to change buses, and as usual I ran into something.  \\"I'm awfully sorry,\\" I said and stepped forward only to run into it again. When it happened a third time, I realized I had been apologizing to a lamppost.  This was just one of the stupid things that constantly happened to me. So I carried on and found the bus stop, which was a request stop, where the bus wouldn't stop unless passengers wanted to get on or off.  No one else was there and I had to try to guess if the bus had arrived. Generally in this situation, because I hated showing I was blind by asking for help, I tried to guess at the sound.  Sometimes I would stop a big lorry and stand there feeling stupid as it drew away. In the end, I usually managed to swallow my pride and ask someone at the stop for help. But on this particular evening no one joined me at the stop; it seemed that everyone had suddenly decided not to travel by bus.  Of course I heard plenty of buses pass, or I thought I did.  But because I had given up stopping them for fear of making a fool of myself, I let them all go by.  I stood there alone for half an hour without stopping one.  Then I gave up.  I decided to walk on to the next stop. Question: What was the problem with guessing at the sound to stop a bus? Options: A: All cars have exactly the same sound. B: No bus would stop to pick up a blind girl. C: Some lorries may have the same sound as that of the bus. D: It took long for the girl to recognize the sound of a bus. The answer to this question is:","output":"C: Some lorries may have the same sound as that of the bus. The problem with guessing the sound to stop a bus is that there may be other vehicles, like lorries, that could produce a similar sound. This can make it difficult for the girl to accurately distinguish between the sounds of a bus and other vehicles."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The literary centres of London have traditionally been hilly Hampstead and (since the early 20th century) Bloomsbury. Writers closely associated with the city are the diarist Samuel Pepys, noted for his eyewitness account of the Great Fire, Charles Dickens, whose representation of a foggy, snowy, grimy London of street sweepers and pickpockets has been a major influence on people's vision of early Victorian London, and Virginia Woolf, regarded as one of the foremost modernist literary figures of the 20th century. Now answer this question: Who witnessed first-hand and wrote about the Great Fire of 1666?","output":"The Great Fire of 1666 in London was witnessed first-hand and written about by Samuel Pepys. He was an English naval administrator and Member of Parliament who is most famous today for the diary he kept for a decade while still a relatively young man. His diary provides valuable first-hand accounts of key events in London's history, including the infamous Great Fire. The Great Fire of London was a major conflagration that swept through the central parts of London from Sunday, September 2nd, to Wednesday, September 5th, 1666. Samuel Pepys’ diary entries from this time provide one of the most vivid primary sources about the fire, with his personal observations and experience of these catastrophic days. Pepys was awakened in the early morning of September 2nd, 1666, by his maid who had spotted a fire in the distance. Initially underestimating the seriousness of the fire, he went back to sleep. However, as the situation worsened, Pepys became more alert and involved, and he began his narrative about the Great Fire in his diary. In his accounts, Pepys described the chaos in the streets, the futile attempts to halt the fire’s progress, and the final toll it wreaked upon the city. He noted the destruction of landmarks, the displacement of residents, and even the change in atmosphere caused by the smoke and flames.  It is to his observations that we owe much of what we know and understand about the historical event of the Great Fire of London. His chronicle provides an invaluable and vivid portrait of London before and after the fire, offering key insights into the lived experience of those cataclysmic days. Despite the passing of centuries, Pepys' account retains a raw vividness and visceral immediacy, reinforcing its value to historians, literary scholars, and anyone interested in this defining moment of London's past."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Context: I was 35 weeks pregnant when I had my stroke. For weeks prior to the event I kept experiencing ‘visual disturbances.’ I felt when I was reading a newspaper or book a sense that my eyes were crossing. I’d feel aware right before it would occur and I would rush to look in a mirror only to discover my eyes were not crossing. I informed my OB who blamed it on the blood vessels in my eyes enlarging due to pregnancy. Ummm ok. You know more than me. Later I was told by a surgeon what I was experiencing was ‘textbook’ for the passing of blood clots through my occipital area of the brain! The feeling would eventually subside. I awoke one morning feeling ‘kind of fuzzy’ headed. Like I had slept too hard. I sat with my husband at the kitchen table for our morning coffee and newspaper and for no reason I could imagine I was unable to swallow my coffee and it dribbled out the left side of my mouth. My husband asked me what was going on and I apparently told him, I was ‘stroking’ out. He got up from the table assuming I was OK and went off to take his morning shower. While in the shower it occurred to him something might not be right. He came back to the table where I was struggling to lift myself from the chair. I put my hands on the table to lift my body and my left hand kept sliding off the edge. He finally got behind me and tried to lift me under my arms and I crumbled to the floor. He then called my OB and told him he thought I’d had a stroke. My OB immediately expressed his doubt but my husband was advised to call an ambulance to get me to the ER. I never really experienced pain from the stroke. Question: What is the name of the narrator's husband?

Solve -2837*v - 11060 = 3125 for v.","output":"Sure, I'll be happy to help you solve this, just like we would solve a simple subtraction problem! So, in the equation -2837*v - 11060 = 3125, we are trying to find out what value 'v' should be. To solve it, we first get rid of the -11060 from the left side by adding 11060 to both sides of the equation. When we do this, the equation now reads: -2837*v = 3125 + 11060. 3125 + 11060 equals 14185. So now the equation reads: -2837*v = 14185. Finally, we will get 'v' alone by dividing both sides by -2837. So, it will look like this: v = 14185 / -2837.  When you divide 14185 by -2837, you get approximately -5. So, v = -5.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","output":"In the process described above, coal is utilized as a fuel source to generate heat, which ultimately leads to the production of electricity. To further understand the perturbation hypothesis mentioned, we need to analyze the process step-by-step and discuss the potential effects if no heat is produced during the procedure. 1. Coal Selection: Before the actual heating process can begin, a specific type of coal must be chosen based on its heat generation ability, carbon content, and other factors such as the presence of impurities and environmental impact. The absence of heat generation would have a direct impact on the coal selection criteria. 2. Coal Preparation: The chosen coal is broken down into smaller, more manageable particles. This process is essential because it ensures better mixing with hot air and more efficient combustion. If there is no heat generation, the coal preparation step would still continue, but it would not significantly contribute to the process's overall efficiency. 3. Coal Combustion and Hot Air Mixing: The coal particles mix with hot air and are transported to a boiler. Normally, the coal particles are heated or burn in the presence of oxygen in the air, releasing heat energy. If no heat is produced during this step, this implies that the combustion of coal does not occur, which is a significant deviation from the regular process. 4. Steam Production and Power Generation: The heat generated by the coal combustion heats the water in the boiler, producing high-pressure steam. The steam then drives turbine blades, causing them to rotate and magnetically charge wire coils, consequently generating electricity. No heat generation would mean that the water in the boiler would not turn into steam, and no electricity would be generated since the turbine would not operate. 5. Water Recirculation: After going through the process, the steam loses heat, condenses back into water, and returns to the chamber to be heated again. In the absence of heat generation, the water would not undergo the entire process and would not need to be recirculated. 6. Overall Impact: If no heating occurs during the process, this means that there is no combustion, which can happen due to inappropriate coal choice, lack of oxygen, or malfunction in the heating system. This perturbation would have a direct impact on the process since it disrupts the entire heat-based power generation system, leading to no electricity production. The boiler, turbines, and generator would remain inactive, and the system would require troubleshooting for potential errors or malfunctions. In conclusion, the proposed perturbation hypothesis, \\"suppose no heating occurs,\\" would significantly impact the process. Since heat generation is a fundamental aspect of coal-based power generation, the absence of heat would directly affect the efficiency and functionality of the system, leading to no electricity production. It is essential to ensure that all components of the system are working correctly and that the chosen coal is suitable for heat generation. Otherwise, costly disruptions in electricity production may occur."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Boston woman stops man who allegedly flashed her on train A Boston woman single-handedly grabbed a man by his collar and held him until police arrived after she says he exposed himself to her on a crowded Boston train during Thursday’s commute, MyFoxBoston.com reported. The woman, who asked not to be identified, said she tried to move away from Michael Galvin, the accused flasher, but he followed her. She told the Boston Herald that she zoned out, listening to music, only to look up and see him standing over her. “I looked up and felt awkward, so I looked down,” she said. She said the man was exposing and touching himself, but tried to cover himself with his shirt. The woman, 24, yelled, but fellow passengers did not react, she said. So she said she went into “She-Hulk” mode and lunged off the train at the man, held him by his sweat shirt and called police. “I don’t know how I held on to him,” she said. “Because he really tried to pull away and I was just holding on with one hand.” The alleged flasher told the woman that he’s sick and needs help, she said. The Herald reports that the man told police that his shorts fell off because of the “packed and jostling” trolley, according to a police report. He reportedly told police that he was unaware he was exposed until the woman started screaming. Galvin was charged with open and gross lewdness. He was released on his own recognizance and is scheduled to be back in court on May 30. He faces up to three years in prison if found guilty. Click here for more on this story from The Boston Herald.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose thee is no baby bird happens, how will it affect baby bird is cared for until it is an adult bird.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis suggests that if there is no baby bird, it will have an impact on the subsequent steps in the process of a bird's life cycle. To analyze the effects, let's examine each step: 1. A bird hatches from an egg: Since there is no baby bird in this scenario, there isn't an egg hatching to begin with. This eliminates the starting point for the entire process. 2. The bird is nurtured by its parents: With no baby bird to nurture, the parents will have no reason to care for or protect an offspring. This means that this step will not happen as well. 3. The bird is fed food for growth: Since there is no baby bird to feed, the parents will not bring food and the growth-related feeding will be nonexistent. 4. The bird grows: As there is no baby bird, there will be no growth or development happening in this step. 5. Begins to learn how to fly: With no baby bird growing and developing, there is no bird to learn flying skills or practice for eventual independence. 6. The bird matures: Without a baby bird growing and learning, there is no bird to reach maturity or enter adulthood, so this step is also void. 7. The bird leaves its nest: Since there is no maturing bird, there will be no instance of a bird leaving its nest as it transitions to independence. 8. The bird makes its own nest: With no adult bird that developed from a baby bird, there is no bird to create its own nest and begin the cycle anew. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis stating that there is no baby bird has a direct and significant effect on the entire process of a bird's life cycle. It essentially halts the entire life cycle, with none of the subsequent steps taking place due to the absence of a baby bird.

The correct answer gives the full name. - Manhattan is a place, not a person, so it cannot be arrested or involved in a relationship. - Pusepa is not mentioned as the one being arrested in the original text.

Renee Chaires, 39, was at her brother Eric Stayton's home in the 5600 block of Ed White Court in the Chaires Community Saturday night. About a dozen people were celebrating Chaires' and her 23-year-old daughter's birthdays, according to Leon County Sheriff's Office spokesman Lt. James McQuaig.      Chaires was standing next her daughter in the home's carport when Stayton, 50, began re-creating a scene from the movie \\"Tombstone.\\" Stayton was twirling a gun in the air when the gun fell to the ground and discharged, hitting Chaires in the neck.

Eric Stayton took a cue from the 1993 flick “Tombstone,” in which actor Michael Biehn, as Johnny Ringo, twirls his pistol during a barroom showdown with Val Kilmer, playing Doc Holliday.      Stayton turned the birthday celebration into a crime scene Saturday night when he accidentally shot his sister, 39-year-old Renee, Chaires, while she was standing next to her 23-year-old daughter and surrounded by about a dozen friends and relatives, according to the Tallahassee Democrat.      Renee Chaires was fatally shot while she was at a birthday party for her and her daughter. Chaires would've turned 40 this week. (Facebook)      Both Chaires, a hair stylist, and her daughter were celebrating their birthdays.      Stayton was twirling his gun in the air, and as he attempted to put the weapon in his holster, it slipped from his hand, struck the concrete floor and fired.      Renee Chaires was fatally shot while her family was holding a cookout at her older brother Eric Stayton's house. (wctv)      “During this gathering there had been an accidental discharge of a firearm which resulted in, ultimately, the death of one of the persons there at the cookout,” said Leon County Sheriff’s Office spokesman James McQuaig.

The party has been in opposition at the federal level since the 2013 election. Bill Shorten has been the party's federal parliamentary leader since 13 October 2013. The party is a federal party with branches in each state and territory. Labor is in government in the states of Victoria, Queensland, Western Australia, South Australia, and in both the Australian Capital Territory and Northern Territory. The party competes against the Liberal/National Coalition for political office at the federal and state (and sometimes local) levels.  Labor's constitution has long stated: \\"The Australian Labor Party is a democratic socialist party and has the objective of the democratic socialisation of industry, production, distribution and exchange, to the extent necessary to eliminate exploitation and other anti-social features in these fields\\". This \\"socialist objective\\" was introduced in 1921, but was later qualified by two further objectives: \\"maintenance of and support for a competitive non-monopolistic private sector\\" and \\"the right to own private property\\". Labor governments have not attempted the \\"democratic socialisation\\" of any industry since the 1940s, when the Chifley government failed to nationalise the private banks, and in fact have privatised several industries such as aviation and banking.

The Drew Carey Show is an American sitcom that aired on ABC from 1995 to 2004, and was set in Cleveland, Ohio, and revolved around the retail office and home life of \\"everyman\\" Drew Carey, a fictionalized version of the actor. The show was created by Carey, who had both stand-up comedy and writing experience, and Bruce Helford, who was once a writer for Roseanne. It was the first television show to have an episode simulcast on the Internet. Produced by Mohawk Productions in association with Warner Bros. Television, it debuted on September 13, 1995, and ranked among the Top 30 programs for four seasons before sliding in popularity. Beginning in season 8, the show rotated through 9 different opening sequences, each of which contained a new version of one of the show's three theme songs. Each theme (\\"Moon Over Parma\\", \\"Five O'Clock World\\" and \\"Cleveland Rocks\\") was seen in three different segments, in new, wildly different arrangements. The show eventually went back to having just five main characters, akin to the first season, as Kate, Mr. Wick, and Steve were eventually written out of the show. Kate's character was married off, Mr. Wick disappeared after three appearances until the Season 8 finale, wherein it is revealed he became a weatherman (although he continued to appear in the opening credits, unlike Kate, who was eliminated completely, and never mentioned again.) Steve left at the beginning of the ninth season to \\"find himself\\".  With Winfred-Louder closed, the location became the office of online retailer Neverending Store. Drew, Mimi, and Mr. Wick were hired as employees of the new company. Mimi was hired first in a similar role to her old job, and Drew was eventually hired as \\"Internal Expediting Analyst\\", and a recurring gag began wherein Drew had no clue as to what his job entailed. Before being written out, Mr. Wick was at first a janitor, and another recurring joke came in the form of Mr. Wick attempting to climb the ladder back to being the boss. Before being written out, he went from janitor to the carrier of the dessert trolley.  Kate left after the first two episodes of season 8, the same two episodes that introduced Kellie, an old high school friend of Drew's who had been working as a stripper. She eventually became a waitress at The Warsaw Tavern, Drew's girlfriend, and the carrier of his child. The plot of the final episode was Drew and Kellie attempting to get married before their child is born. Mr. Wick also returned and stayed on for the series finale.  The show began featuring cameos from reality-TV participants in the final two seasons, such as former Road Rules star Timmy Beggy, The Real World alumna Cara Khan, and The Amazing Race winner Reichen Lehmkuhl. Tony the Bus Driver (Bill Cobbs) became a regular, serving as smart-alecky \\"bartender\\" type to whom Drew could tell his problems. The eighth season was put in a timeslot that frequently clashed with Monday Night Football. It was pulled mid-season and the remaining episodes were shown during the summer of 2003. The ninth season did not air until the summer of 2004, with most of the episodes out of order.  The last season's tone changed radically from the previous seasons. The directors began experimenting with one-camera set-ups, showing the sets completely built, with four walls in most rooms, and with rooms actually linked together. The writers also began experimenting, including story lines in which Gus burns down Mimi's house, forcing her to move in with Drew after Steve leaves her.

Given the two facts above, what causes an object to heat? The answer is:","output":"Given the two facts above, an object heats up due to the absorption of energy, which can come in various forms, including sunlight. When an object absorbs energy, its particles gain kinetic energy, causing them to move or vibrate more rapidly. This increase in particle motion results in a rise in the object's temperature, leading to the object heating up. In the context of an ecosystem, sunlight serves as a primary source of energy for many living organisms, which they utilize for various processes like photosynthesis.

Step 2: Assess Aubrey's emotions Given the context, Aubrey is likely to be experiencing a mix of emotions, such as shock, sadness, grief, or even disbelief. The memories of Remy running through their mind suggest that Aubrey is reminiscing about their experiences with Remy and is most likely emotionally affected by the news. Step 3: Evaluate the validity of the answer \\"Nothing\\" The answer \\"Nothing\\" suggests that Aubrey would not feel any emotions as a result of learning about Remy's death and recalling memories of Remy.

Step 2: Eliminate irrelevant choices - Mass: It refers to the amount of matter in an object, not necessarily its size. Also, the mass can change due to various factors, so it's not irreversible. Eliminate this choice. - Strength: It refers to the ability of a material or object to withstand an applied force, not its size. Eliminate this choice. Step 3: Analyze remaining choices - Volume: It refers to the amount of space an object occupies. An increase in volume could be a sign of an increase in size; however, it is not necessarily irreversible. For example, a balloon can expand its volume, but it can also deflate and return to its original size.

All six were charged with conspiring to commit misconduct in a public office. They included The Sun's head of news Chris Pharo, who faced six charges, while ex-managing editor Graham Dudman and ex-Sun deputy news editor Ben O'Driscoll were accused of four charges each. Thames Valley district reporter Jamie Pyatt and picture editor John Edwards were charged with three counts each, while ex-reporter John Troup was accused of two counts. The trial related to illegal payments allegedly made to public officials, with prosecutors saying the men conspired to pay officials from 2002–11, including police, prison officers and soldiers. They were accused of buying confidential information about the Royal Family, public figures and prison inmates. They all denied the charges. On 16 January 2015, Troup and Edwards were cleared by the jury of all charges against them. The jury also partially cleared O'Driscoll and Dudman but continued deliberating over other counts faced by them, as well as the charges against Pharo and Pyatt. On 21 January 2015, the jury told the court that it was unable to reach unanimous verdicts on any of the outstanding charges and was told by the judge, Richard Marks, that he would accept majority verdicts. Shortly afterwards, one of the jurors sent a note to the judge and was discharged. The judge told the remaining 11 jurors that their colleague had been \\"feeling unwell and feeling under a great deal of pressure and stress from the situation you are in\\", and that under the circumstances he was prepared to accept majority verdicts of \\"11 to zero or 10 to 1\\". On 22 January 2015, the jury was discharged after failing to reach verdicts on the outstanding charges. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) announced that it would seek a retrial.

This movie leaves me looking forward to the director's next film; we can say of Rian Johnson, as somebody once said about a dame named Brigid O'Shaughnessy, 'You're good. You're very good.' 2. Brick would be better with a bit more Lynch in its soul, but Johnson is his own man, and I look forward to what he comes up with next. 3. Even as you struggle to keep up with its speedy chatter and multi-character complexity, Brick is always entertaining. 4. There are a million stories in the naked city, and Brick never gets around to telling any of them. 5. Johnson takes the regular travails of high school life - romances, cliques and clashes, teenage pregnancy and drugs - and applies the stylings of Dashiell Hammett for a schoolyard film noir that never plays as gimmicky as it might sound. 6. You can't deny the fellow who made it has talent. 7. Johnson also grabs hold of a fundamental truth and seduces us with it: The schoolyard can be the noirest burg of all. 8. What sounds like a stunt, or a genre-mashup oddity like Bugsy Malone, proves to be a sharp, tongue-in-cheek exercise, balancing deadpan menace with well-timed comedy. 9. The single most satisfying cinematic experience of 'Brick' lies in witnessing director Johnson's matter-of-fact transformation of the contemporary American suburban landscape into a moral stage of mythic proportion. 10. It may be a little predictable, but it gets points for style and for making the effort to be different. What is the consensus?","output":"The consensus on the movie 'Brick,' directed by Rian Johnson, is overwhelmingly positive. The director is highly commended for his talent and ability to truly engage the audience. The critics look forward to seeing his future works, indicating their respect for this director's skill. The viewers thoroughly enjoyed the narrative of the film despite its complexity. Even though the film does not explore traditional city tales, it stands out by taking the mundane setting of a schoolyard and transforming it into an intricate noir landscape. The film's unique narrative style is consistently referred to as innovative, taking on ordinary high school lives and presenting them through a stylistic lens reminiscent of Dashiell Hammett. The cinematic transformation of the suburban American landscape into a morally significant stage was seen as the most satisfying aspect of the movie. The decision to morph the everyday routine into a noir setting is not only appealing but also recognizes the schoolyard as possibly the darkest city of all, reflecting a profound truth. Despite some critiques, where the movie is said to be slightly predictable, the film seems to excel in its style and its efforts to stand out, thus gaining points for the same. The film also manages to balance its noir threats with well-timed comedy for a more enjoyable watch. This enables the film to somewhat transcend its anticipated gimmickry and provide a more indulgent viewing experience. In conclusion, the film is deemed as sharp, tongue-in-cheek enjoyably complex, and effectively stylish. Rian Johnson's 'Brick' tends to represent high-school life in a noir lens with surprising profundity and humor, marking it as a commendable cinematic experience. It might bear some minor predictability issues, but its stylistic approach and unique narrative structure largely overshadow it, making it a film that truly stands out in the eyes of the critics. As a result, it is looked upon with anticipation for what the director would come up with next."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Q:Information:  - Surra (from the Marathi \\"sra\\", meaning the sound of heavy breathing through nostrils, of imitative origin) is a disease of vertebrate animals. The disease is caused by protozoan trypanosomes, specifically \\"Trypanosoma evansi\\", of several species which infect the blood of the vertebrate host, causing fever, weakness, and lethargy which lead to weight loss and anemia. In some animals the disease is fatal unless treated.  - Trypanosomiasis or trypanosomosis is the name of several diseases in vertebrates caused by parasitic protozoan trypanosomes of the genus \\"Trypanosoma\\".  - Trypanosoma cruzi is a species of parasitic euglenoids. Amongst the protozoa, the trypanosomes characteristically bore tissue in another organism and feed on blood (primarily) and also lymph. This behaviour causes disease or the likelihood of disease that varies with the organism: for example, trypanosomiasis in humans (Chagas disease in South America ), dourine and surra in horses, and a brucellosis-like disease in cattle. Parasites need a host body and the haematophagous insect triatomine (descriptions \\"assassin bug\\", \\"cone-nose bug\\", and \\"kissing bug\\") is the major vector in accord with a mechanism of infection. The triatomine likes the nests of vertebrate animals for shelter, where it bites and sucks blood for food. Individual triatomines infected with protozoa from other contact with animals transmit trypanosomes when the triatomine deposits its faeces on the host's skin surface and then bites. Penetration of the infected faeces is further facilitated by the scratching of the bite area by the human or animal host.  - A protease (also called a peptidase or proteinase) is any enzyme that performs proteolysis; protein catabolism by hydrolysis of peptide bonds. Proteases have evolved multiple times, and different classes of protease can perform the same reaction by completely different catalytic mechanisms. Proteases can be found in Animalia, Plantae, Fungi, Bacteria, Archaea and viruses.  - South America is a continent located in the western hemisphere, mostly in the southern hemisphere, with a relatively small portion in the northern hemisphere. It is also considered a subcontinent of the Americas, which is the model used in nations that speak Romance languages. The reference to South America instead of other regions (like Latin America or the Southern Cone) has increased in the last decades due to changing geopolitical dynamics (in particular, the rise of Brazil).  - Cysteine (abbreviated as Cys or C) is a semi-essential proteinogenic amino acid with the formula HOCCH(NH)CHSH. It is encoded by the codons UGU and UGC. The thiol side chain in cysteine often participates in enzymatic reactions, as a nucleophile. The thiol is susceptible to oxidization to give the disulfide derivative cystine, which serves an important structural role in many proteins. When used as a food additive, it has the E number E920.  - Chagas disease, also known as American trypanosomiasis, is a tropical parasitic disease caused by the protozoan \\"Trypanosoma cruzi\\". It is spread mostly by insects known as Triatominae or kissing bugs. The symptoms change over the course of the infection. In the early stage, symptoms are typically either not present or mild, and may include fever, swollen lymph nodes, headaches, or local swelling at the site of the bite. After 812 weeks, individuals enter the chronic phase of disease and in 6070% it never produces further symptoms. The other 30 to 40% of people develop further symptoms 10 to 30 years after the initial infection, including enlargement of the ventricles of the heart in 20 to 30%, leading to heart failure. An enlarged esophagus or an enlarged colon may also occur in 10% of people. \\"T. cruzi\\" is commonly spread to humans and other mammals by the blood-sucking \\"kissing bugs\\" of the subfamily Triatominae. These insects are known by a number of local names, including: \\"vinchuca\\" in Argentina, Bolivia, Chile and Paraguay, \\"barbeiro\\" (the barber) in Brazil, \\"pito\\" in Colombia, \\"chinche\\" in Central America, and \\"chipo\\" in Venezuela. The disease may also be spread through blood transfusion, organ transplantation, eating food contaminated with the parasites, and by vertical transmission (from a mother to her fetus). Diagnosis of early disease is by finding the parasite in the blood using a microscope. Chronic disease is diagnosed by finding antibodies for \\"T. cruzi\\" in the blood. Prevention mostly involves eliminating kissing bugs and avoiding their bites. Other preventative efforts include screening blood used for transfusions. A vaccine has not been developed as of 2013. Early infections are treatable with the medication benznidazole or nifurtimox. Medication nearly always results in a cure if given early, but becomes less effective the longer a person has had Chagas disease. When used in chronic disease, medication may delay or prevent the development of endstage symptoms. Benznidazole and nifurtimox...  - A catalytic triad refers to the three amino acid residues that function together at the centre of the active site of some hydrolase and transferase enzymes (e.g. proteases, amidases, esterases, acylases, lipases and -lactamases). An Acid-Base-Nucleophile triad is a common motif for generating a nucleophilic residue for covalent catalysis. The residues form a charge-relay network to polarise and activate the nucleophile, which attacks the substrate, forming a covalent intermediate which is then hydrolysed to regenerate free enzyme and release the product. The nucleophile is most commonly a serine or cysteine amino acid, but occasionally threonine. Because enzymes fold into complex three-dimensional structures, the residues of a catalytic triad can be far from each other along the amino-acid sequence (primary structure), however, they are brought close together in the final fold.  - Proteins (or ) are large biomolecules, or macromolecules, consisting of one or more long chains of amino acid residues. Proteins perform a vast array of functions within organisms, including catalysing metabolic reactions, DNA replication, responding to stimuli, and transporting molecules from one location to another. Proteins differ from one another primarily in their sequence of amino acids, which is dictated by the nucleotide sequence of their genes, and which usually results in protein folding into a specific three-dimensional structure that determines its activity.  - Cysteine proteases, also known as thiol proteases, are enzymes that degrade proteins. These proteases share a common catalytic mechanism that involves a nucleophilic cysteine thiol in a catalytic triad or dyad.  - Enzymes are macromolecular biological catalysts. Enzymes accelerate, or catalyze, chemical reactions. The molecules at the beginning of the process upon which enzymes may act are called substrates and the enzyme converts these into different molecules, called products. Almost all metabolic processes in the cell need enzymes in order to occur at rates fast enough to sustain life. The set of enzymes made in a cell determines which metabolic pathways occur in that cell. The study of enzymes is called \\"enzymology\\".  - Cruzipain is a cysteine protease expressed by Trypanosoma cruzi . It is classified under EC 3.4.22.51 .  - In organic chemistry, a thiol is an organosulfur compound that contains a carbon-bonded sulfhydryl or sulphydryl (CSH or RSH) group (where R represents an alkyl or other organic substituent). Thiols are the sulfur analogue of alcohols (that is, sulfur takes the place of oxygen in the hydroxyl group of an alcohol), and the word is a portmanteau of \\"thion\\" + \\"alcohol,\\" with the first word deriving from Greek  (\\"theion\\") = \\"sulfur\\".

Here is a goal: nail clipper How would you accomplish this goal?","output":"To accomplish the goal of using a nail clipper, follow these simple steps: 1. Find a nail clipper: A nail clipper is a small tool with two metal handles and a little blade in the middle. It's usually in the bathroom or a grooming kit. 2. Hold the nail clipper: Hold the two handles between your thumb and a few other fingers. When you press the handles together, the blade will close and you can trim your nails. 3. Choose a nail to clip: Pick one of your fingers or toes with a nail that is long enough to be trimmed. 4. Position the nail clipper: Open the little blade by releasing the handles. Place the tip of your nail between the blade and the flat part of the clipper. Be careful not to put too much of your skin or nail under the blade, as it may cause pain or an uneven cut. 5. Clip the nail: Press the handles together firmly and quickly. The blade will cut your nail, and the trimmed piece will fall away or stay in the clipper. 6. Repeat for other nails: Keep using the nail clipper to trim the rest of your nails on your fingers and toes until they are all neat and even. 7. Clean up: Throw away the trimmed nail pieces and wash your hands or feet. It's also a good idea to clean the nail clipper with soap and water or rubbing alcohol to keep it hygienic. Now you have accomplished the goal of using a nail clipper. Your nails should be shorter and neater, making your hands and feet look and feel better!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Review: freddy gets molested by a dog  Is this movie review sentence negative or positive?","output":"This movie review sentence appears to be negative due to the following reasons: 1. Termination and content: The sentence is not only short and concise, but it conveys a negative and disturbing scenario involving the character \\"Freddy\\" being molested by a dog. This can cause discomfort to the readers and create a bad impression of the movie. 2. Use of vulgar language: The use of the word 'molested' in the sentence is suggestive of a vulgar, sensitive, and uncomfortable situation that would not be typically associated with any positive entertainment experience. Such offensive language contributes to the negative sentiment of the review. 3. Lack of context: The sentence does not provide any context about the movie, like plot, genre, acting, or other elements that could provide the reader with a better understanding of the film. A comprehensive review would include information about the movie's aspects, achievements, or what makes it worth watching. In this case, the review only presents a distressing event, further solidifying the negative perception. 4. Absence of praise or constructive criticism: A positive review would include some form of praise or constructive feedback that highlights the movie's strengths or points out areas where it could improve. There is no indication of any positive aspects or suggestions in this sentence, which only covers a displeasing incident. As a result, it is evident that this movie review sentence leans towards negativity.

All smooth sailing until he takes his \\"bachelor hat\\" off. What would you say about him talking to one of the suggestive dancers and then sleeping with her? What would you say if that exact girl was the cousin of his finance? A new low, right? Well Paul Coleman, played comically by Jason Lee, leads this experience of a nauseous blur and a new low. I got to say this is one of his good leading roles. However I do believe his role in Vanilla Sky was better acted. His finance named Karen is played by the up-and-down actress Selma Blair while Karen's character, Becky, is played by the lovely and talented Julia Stiles. Getting back to where we left off, Paul now has to deal with one arising problem to another.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Process:  - Air is pulled into the lungs - Oxygen moves from the lungs into the bloodstream - Air is pushed through the vocal chords - A person talks - Other air is pushed out of the lungs into the environment.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose my nose is clear happens, how will it affect I cannot breath well.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis you provided is: \\"suppose my nose is clear happens, how will it affect I cannot breathe well.\\" This hypothesis suggests that if your nose is clear, it may affect your breathing. It's important to first clarify the normal process of breathing and talking: 1. Air is pulled into the lungs through the nose or mouth. This happens involuntarily in a process called inhalation. 2. Oxygen from the inhaled air moves from the lungs into the bloodstream through tiny blood vessels called capillaries. This is facilitated by the large surface area of the alveoli, small sacs within the lungs. 3. When a person talks, air is pushed from the lungs through the vocal cords (within the larynx) to create sounds. This requires voluntary control over the muscles involved in exhaling and in the production of speech. 4. Exhaled air, which contains carbon dioxide and other waste gases, is pushed out of the lungs and into the environment through the nose or mouth. Now, let's examine how the perturbation of a clear nose may affect breathing. If your nose is clear, it implies that there is no blockage or congestion in the nasal passages. As a result, air can flow more freely through the nose during both inhalation and exhalation. This is generally beneficial for the breathing process, as it allows for more efficient gas exchange and can help prevent excessive strain on the respiratory system. However, the hypothesis statement also mentions that \\"I cannot breathe well,\\" suggesting that there might still be an issue with breathing despite the clear nose. In this case, the problem may not be directly related to the nose, but to other factors affecting the respiratory system. Possibilities might include lung conditions (such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), anxiety or stress, or even improper breathing techniques. To summarize, a clear nose typically has a positive effect on the breathing process, as it facilitates the efficient intake of oxygen and removal of waste gases. However, if you still have difficulty breathing with a clear nose, the root cause may be unrelated to nasal congestion and could involve other factors affecting the respiratory system."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

It's impossible to say. While the information provided in the paragraph showcases the enduring legacy of Marvel Comics and highlights a significant character from the Golden Age of Comic Books, it does not give us enough information to conclusively determine if Marvel Comics are always classic reads. The Angel, as one of the many characters featured in Marvel Comics, was indeed created during an iconic period, but the overall quality and timelessness of Marvel Comics cannot be solely determined through the information provided in the paragraph. Marvel Comics has an extensive history with numerous characters and storylines, and opinions on what constitutes a \\"classic read\\" can vary greatly among readers. Some may argue that Marvel's classic characters and stories are indeed timeless, while others might suggest that there are specific periods or storylines that are more engaging and memorable. The enduring popularity and continued success of Marvel Comics do point to a potential consensus among many fans that the comics hold a certain level of timelessness and classic appeal. However, without more comprehensive information on the various eras, storylines, and creative teams involved in Marvel Comics over the years, we cannot definitively say whether all Marvel Comics are always classic reads.

Would \\"The story was an imaginary tale which told the final story of the Silver Age Superman and his long history, which was being rebooted following the events of Crisis on Infinite Earths , before his modern introduction in the John Byrne series, The Man of Steel .\\" be a reasonable answer? Answer:","output":"While the statement provided captures a part of Superman's comic book history, there are various important events and story arcs that have occurred to Superman over the decades. Here is a more detailed answer: Superman first appeared in Action Comics #1 in 1938, created by Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster. The character quickly became an icon and an essential part of DC Comics' line-up, spawning a plethora of stories and iterations leading to his current version. The statement you provided mentions the Silver Age Superman, a version that existed mainly from the mid-1950s to the mid-1980s. During this time, Superman underwent numerous adventures with a campier and more science-fiction-focused tone. \\"Crisis on Infinite Earths\\" (1985-1986) was a DC Comics crossover event that aimed to make the DC universe more cohesive and less convoluted by eliminating multiple parallel worlds and alternate versions of characters. As a result, elements of Superman's Silver Age history were rewritten or erased. The story you mentioned, \\"Whatever Happened to the Man of Tomorrow?\\" by Alan Moore, was indeed an \\"imaginary tale\\" or an \\"Elseworlds\\" story, which served as a tribute to Silver Age Superman's long history. It was published in 1986 as a two-part send-off for this version of the character before a major reboot that would redefine Superman for a new era. The reboot involved writer and artist John Byrne, who was tasked with reimagining the character following the reboot. His series, titled \\"The Man of Steel\\" (1986), modernized Superman's origin, powers, and mythos for contemporary audiences. In this new version, Superman's powers were somewhat reduced compared to the Silver Age, making him less god-like and more relatable to readers. The series also offered an updated take on his relationships with supporting characters like Lois Lane, Lex Luthor, Ma and Pa Kent, and others. Since then, Superman has undergone several other significant changes and events in the comics, such as: 1. \\"The Death of Superman\\" (1992): Superman died fighting the monster Doomsday in a highly publicized storyline that captured mainstream media attention. He would later be resurrected, of course. 2. \\"Superman: Red Son\\" (2003): An Elseworlds tale that imagines Superman's origin in the Soviet Union rather than the USA. 3. \\"Infinite Crisis\\" (2005-2006): Another major crossover event that once again redefined the DC universe and revised some aspects of Superman's history. 4. The New 52 (2011): DC Comics rebooted its entire line, including Superman's, with a modern and more streamlined continuity. 5. DC Rebirth (2016): A relaunch of the DC comic book line which sought to restore classic elements of the characters, including Superman's, bringing about a more hopeful and inspiring version of the hero. In summary, various changes and events have happened to Superman in comics throughout the years. While the statement you provided is accurate for a specific moment in Superman's history, it does not encompass the entire scope of his evolution. The character has undergone multiple reboots, reimaginings, and significant storylines that have transformed his narrative over time."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Smartphone usage has skyrocketed at sporting events, as anyone who's attended a recent game can tell you. Look around the stands and you'll see fans checking stats, sharing pictures on social media, or just killing time between plays. While stadiums have boosted cellular and Wi-Fi infrastructure to keep fans connected during games, there's always the possibility that there won't be enough bandwidth for everyone. That's why on Super Bowl Sunday, the NFL is planning to block live streams of the game inside the stadium. Super Bowl XLVIII, between the Denver Broncos and Seattle Seahawks, will be streamed by NFL.com and Fox Sports, but both of those sources will be blocked on the Wi-Fi and cellular networks at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey, NFL CIO Michelle McKenna-Doyle told Ars in a phone interview. The NFL.com and Fox Sports blocks will be implemented both for mobile apps and within Web browsers. The decision stems from last year's Super Bowl, when streaming was initially allowed but eventually blocked when it took up too much bandwidth. \\"We [blocked] it last year, but we did it on the fly when we started having some challenges. This year we planned ahead to do it,\\" McKenna-Doyle said. She said the 82,500-seat stadium will be able to handle 25,000 to 30,000 concurrent Internet users across cellular and Wi-Fi. The NFL didn't tell us what the anticipated speeds are because Verizon, which led the Wi-Fi and cellular buildout, preferred to keep that information under wraps. But the plan is to prioritize upload speeds over download because fans generally spend a lot of time posting photos and statuses to social media. The NFL is providing a Super Bowl app to attendees with an event guide and \\"exclusive content,\\" but it won't include streaming video or replays. \\"While we do know that people like to look at replays on their phones and there are some people who like to stream certain amounts of video in the game, the vast majority of our fans want to watch the game on the field, watch the replays on the jumbo board, and participate in the event more than they want to be checking their phone,\\" McKenna-Doyle said. \\"While we could have made some of that available, it might have impacted the ability for the majority of the fans to be able to stay connected to social media, tweet, Facebook, that kind of thing.\\" Big games, big network usage. At last year's Super Bowl, the Wi-Fi network stayed up even during the infamous mid-game power outage. While some attendees told Ars after last year's game that Wi-Fi access was problematic at times, a broadcast engineer we spoke with measured the network at 23Mbps down and 44Mbps up. It's common at high-density events for fans to have trouble sending text messages or uploading photos, McKenna-Doyle noted. Network congestion is especially pronounced at key moments of each game. While attending the final game of last year's World Series at Fenway Park in Boston, I was able to upload, e-mail, and text photos on the cellular network during the game. Immediately after the final out however, fans swarmed the network and uploads became impossible. \\"When you can't do the basics, it's all of a sudden not that cool that you can show replays or stream the game,\\" McKenna-Doyle said. \\"It's a fine balance. We're pushing the envelope every year. As technology gets better and better I'm willing to take more and more risks about what we allow.\\" McKenna-Doyle is optimistic that multicast technology, as opposed to the unicast tech used today, will limit the amount of data needed for streaming video at future Super Bowls. \\"A Unicast transmission/stream sends IP packets to a single recipient on a network. A Multicast transmission sends IP packets to a group of hosts on a network,\\" explains network video Visionary Solutions. But that won't be used at this year's game, because multicast streaming isn't commonly supported on smartphones yet, McKenna-Doyle said. Keeping fans connected. The Super Bowl restriction doesn't mean live streaming is blocked at every NFL game. For example, the New England Patriots' app provides access to NFL Red Zone video when users are connected to Gillette Stadium's Wi-Fi network. \\"It depends on the stadium,\\" McKenna-Doyle said. \\"Each team manages every game themselves and they have mobile apps that they run. Some allow it based on their infrastructure, and some block it.\\" The Wi-Fi network, open to all fans, has about 900 access points, using Cisco equipment powered by the new 802.11ac standard, according to the NFL. Verizon is providing the Internet connectivity, with about 4Gbps coming into the stadium. While Verizon is the lead vendor, all four major carriers invested in upgrading their Distributed Antenna Systems at the Super Bowl site, McKenna-Doyle said. One nicety provided to attendees is a radio providing four audio feeds from Fox, Westwood One, ESPN Deportes, and the in-stadium public address. While it would be possible to provide audio feeds to a mobile app, McKenna-Doyle noted that \\"We've always given this radio for broadcast, and fans have told us they really love it.\\" As usual, the Super Bowl crew will use monitoring tools to identify hacker attacks on the network or technical problems that prevent fans from getting on the Internet. Monitoring user activity helps plan capacity for future events and fix problems as they arise. Network monitoring tools divide the stadium into sectors, and this year \\"we cut the stadium into more sectors than we had in the past so we can pinpoint more quickly where issues are in a section of the stadium,\\" McKenna-Doyle said. \\"If we start to hear we're having issues in a certain part, we can work on a smaller segment of the stadium without it impacting as many people.\\" What are highlight points for this article?","output":"1.

In a stark contrast to the come-from-behind victory against Denver earlier in the season, San Diego scored early and often in this game, leading the game 28-3 at halftime. It was all Denver in the 3rd quarter, the Broncos closing the gap to 28-20, but San Diego bounced back in the fourth quarter with 20 unanswered points, winning the game 48-20. The win, as well as a Kansas City Chiefs loss earlier in the day, clinched the AFC West Division for San Diego. With the Indianapolis Colts also losing earlier in the day, San Diego gained the best record in the AFC (11-2). In addition, with his 7-yard rushing touchdown toward the end of the 4th quarter (his third of the game), RB LaDainian Tomlinson broke the NFL single-season touchdown record (29) (26 Rushing, 3 receiving), set by the Seattle Seahawks' RB Shaun Alexander (28) in the previous season.

Process:  - Magma rises from deep in the earth - The magma goes into volcanos - The volcanos pressure the magma upwards - The pressure causes the magma to push through the surface of the volcano - The lava cools - The lava forms new rock - New magma is pressured to the surface of the volcano - The volcano bursts through the rock the formed after the last eruption.  suppose the lava keeps flowing and does not cool happens, how will it affect the magma does not burst through the newly formed lava rock.  Which of the following is the supposed perturbation?  - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","output":"The supposed perturbation of the lava continuously flowing and not cooling would indirectly impact a step of the process. To understand this, let's first briefly revisit the main steps involved in the formation of a volcano and its eruptions: 1. Magma rises from deep within the Earth due to convection currents, tectonic plate movements, or hotspots. 2. This magma accumulates in magma chambers beneath volcanic structures. 3. Over time, pressure builds up in the magma chambers as more magma accumulates, and dissolved gases become trapped. 4. The increasing pressure forces magma through fissures or vents, leading to a volcanic eruption. 5. As lava flows out of the volcano, it cools and solidifies, forming new layers of rock. 6. After the eruption, the cycle repeats as more magma rises and accumulates beneath the surface, eventually leading to another eruption. In the hypothetical scenario where lava keeps flowing and does not cool, this would indirectly impact steps 5 and 6 of the process, as the lava would not solidify and create the new layer of rock. The continuous flow of lava means there is less pressure build-up in the magma chamber, making it less likely for the volcano to erupt through the newly formed rock layers. However, it is important to note that this perturbation may not completely stop the formation of new rock layers or prevent future eruptions. Over time, the lava flow rate may decrease, allowing some parts of the lava flow to cool and create rock formations. Additionally, other factors such as increasing magma supply or tectonic forces could eventually cause the volcanic eruption to break through the uncooled lava flow. In summary, the perturbation of lava continuously flowing and not cooling affects the process indirectly by altering the conditions that lead to the formation of new rock layers after an eruption. This can change how pressure builds up within the magma chamber, potentially impacting the timing and intensity of future eruptions."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Barnes & Noble bets on the Nook If you’re the type of early Christmas shopper who bought a Kindle last week, I hope you kept the receipt, because a newer, equally affordable option is about to hit shelves. Barnes & Noble BKS CEO Steve Riggio on Tuesday took the stage before hundreds of authors, agents, publishers and pundits to debut the company’s electronic reader, the Nook. The Nook will sell for just 259, a steep discount from competitors like the Sony SNE Reader and the iRex DR800SG , which both retail for 399. The price suggests Barnes & Noble is going straight for Amazon AMZN , which recently lowered the Kindle’s price to 259. The Nook uses the same screen technology that powers Amazon’s Kindle, but adds an iPhone-like color touchscreen below for easy navigation. Readers have access to 3G wireless on AT&T’s broadband network. The reader holds up to 1,500 books (like its major competitor), but an expandable memory slot allows readers to add up to 17,500 more. “You’re getting a lot of eReader for the money,” says Sarah Rotman Epps, an analyst with Forrester Research. Another novel experiment: lending. Barnes & Noble lets readers share titles with friends on any platform in the Barnes & Noble ecosystem. So you like the “Tipping Point?” Buy it for your Nook and lend it to your sister to read on her Barnes & Noble iPhone application. (She’d better not procrastinate; she has 14 days before it disappears.) Barnes & Noble will turn its massive retail presence into a competitive advantage. Over the next few weeks, the bookstore chain will roll out Nook displays in its 700 stores and 600 college bookstores. Through complimentary Wi-Fi connections in all the stores, readers will be able to browse eBooks on their readers just as they might have always browsed the shelves. The eBook market is tiny, but its growth has been explosive this year. eBook accounts for less than 2% of traditional book sales, but the 16.2 million in sales for July, for example, represented a 213% increase over a year ago, according to Forrester Research. Right now Amazon has 60% of the market, but the eReader is expected to be a popular Christmas item this year, and Barnes & Noble plans to get in on that opportunity. Pre-orders for the Nook will begin this week, and the company says it will begin shipping in late November. The large bookstore has been lunging into the eBook market at full force. It purchased independent eBook seller Fictionwise earlier this year and launched its own eBook store in July. It has also unleashed a series of smartphone applications, with more planned. While there’s no guarantee Barnes & Noble will succeed, it’s a necessary move as the book market becomes increasing tough to navigate. Traditional books — the kind you bring to the beach and lug on the subway — are getting much cheaper. In the last week, Amazon, Wal-Mart WMT , and Target TGT have begun selling some of this year’s hardbacks that are anticipated to be the most popular — books like Stephen King’s “Under the Dome ” (35.00) and Sarah Palin’s “Going Rogue” (list price: 28.99) — for roughly 9 on pre-orders. Sure, it’s typical to discount bestsellers, especially during the holidays, but few retailers are bold enough to bring down the prices by more than 50%. Barnes & Noble must now hope the Nook masters its niche. What was this article about?","output":"This article is about Barnes & Noble, an American bookseller, launching its electronic reader called Nook in an attempt to compete with Amazon's Kindle.

That means the public sees class as an even bigger source of conflict than immigration, race relations, or generational differences. \\"It's kind of amazing,\\" the study's author tells the Washington Post, noting that perception of the conflict's intensity is up as well—the number of people considering tensions \\"very strong\\" doubled to 30%. \\"That's what makes it striking and politically important.\\" Still, not everyone who saw the tensions condemned the rich; 43% believe most wealthy people got that way through \\"their own hard work,\\" just behind the 46% who believe it's because \\"they know the right people or were born into wealthy families.\\" Article:","output":"Title: More Americans See Big Conflict Between Rich and Poor Hey kids, today we are going to talk about something that many people in America are talking about. They are thinking about the differences between people who have a lot of money and people who don't have much money. This is called a \\"conflict between rich and poor\\".  A group of people called Pew Research asked many people what they think about this. They found out that 67 out of 100 people believe there is a big or very big problem because of the differences between rich and poor people. This is a lot more than what people thought two years ago. This means that more people in America think that this problem is even bigger than problems about people coming from other countries, or problems between people of different colors, or problems between older people and younger people. The person who did this study said, \\"It's kind of amazing\\". He also said that more people think this problem is getting even bigger and stronger. This is important because it can affect decisions made by people who run the country. But, not all people believe that rich people are bad or didn't work hard. 43 out of 100 people think that rich people have lots of money because they worked very hard. 46 out of 100 people think they have lots of money because they know the right people or were born into families that already have lots of money.

Michael Joseph Jackson (August 29, 1958 - June 25, 2009) was an American singer, songwriter, and dancer. Dubbed the \\"King of Pop\\", he was one of the most popular entertainers in the world, and was the best-selling music artist during the year of his death. Jackson's contributions to music, dance, and fashion along with his publicized personal life made him a global figure in popular culture for over four decades. The eighth child of the Jackson family, Michael made his professional debut in 1964 with his elder brothers Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, and Marlon as a member of the Jackson 5. Jackson was influenced by musicians including Little Richard, James Brown, Jackie Wilson, Diana Ross, Fred Astaire, Sammy Davis Jr., Gene Kelly, David Ruffin, the Isley Brothers, and the Bee Gees. While Little Richard had a substantial influence on Jackson, James Brown was his greatest inspiration; he said: \\"Ever since I was a small child, no more than like six years old, my mother would wake me no matter what time it was, if I was sleeping, no matter what I was doing, to watch the television to see the master at work. And when I saw him move, I was mesmerized. I had never seen a performer perform like James Brown, and right then and there I knew that was exactly what I wanted to do for the rest of my life because of James Brown.\\"  Jackson owed his vocal technique in large part to Diana Ross, especially his use of the oooh interjection, which he used from a young age; Ross had used this effect on many of the songs recorded with the Supremes. Not only a mother figure to him, she was often observed in rehearsal as an accomplished performer. He said: \\"I got to know her well. She taught me so much. I used to just sit in the corner and watch the way she moved. She was art in motion. I studied the way she moved, the way she sang - just the way she was.\\" He told her: \\"I want to be just like you, Diana.\\" She said: \\"You just be yourself.\\"  According to choreographer David Winters, who met and befriended Jackson while choreographing the 1971 Diana Ross TV special Diana!, Jackson watched the musical West Side Story almost every week, and it was his favorite film; he paid tribute to it in \\"Beat It\\" and the \\"Bad\\" video.

On the Jets' next possession, Pennington fired a 44-yard touchdown pass to Justin McCareins, his first touchdown of the season, to open up a 14-0 lead. The Lions would get on the board early in the second quarter as Jon Kitna had big completions to Dan Campbell, Mike Furrey, and Roy Williams, the pass to Williams a 22-yard touchdown. But on the kickoff, Justin Miller returned the ball 56 yards inside Detroit territory, and after a pass from Pennington to Cotchery, Kevan Barlow scored on a 3-yard touchdown run. Kitna would get intercepted by Kerry Rhodes on the next possession, but Pennington would then get picked off by Terrence Holt at the Detroit 2-yard line to short-circuit a possible score. The Jets led 21-7 at halftime. Kitna would again get intercepted on the first possession of the second half, this time by Jonathan Vilma.

Select from: -- description -- entity -- abbreviation -- human -- numeric -- location","output":"In the early Popeye cartoons, an interesting method was used to run the credits. The production company, Fleischer Studios, employed a technique called the \\"Tabletop Credits.\\" This method made the credits stand out and provided a unique way of presenting the information. This answer will give an in-depth description of the Tabletop Credits method. The Tabletop Credits method was essentially a stop-motion animation technique used in the opening credits of early Popeye cartoons produced by Fleischer Studios in the 1930s. Fleischer Studios was an American animation studio, founded by brothers Max Fleischer and Dave Fleischer, and was mainly responsible for producing Popeye the Sailor content during this period. To understand the Tabletop Credits technique, it is important to first familiarize oneself with stop-motion animation. Stop-motion animation is a technique in which physical objects, such as figurines, miniatures, or models, are manipulated in small increments between individually photographed frames, creating the illusion of movement when the series of frames is played as a continuous sequence. In other words, instead of drawing the animation by hand or using computer-generated imagery, stop-motion brings static objects to life through a series of photographs that are then sequenced together. In the context of early Popeye cartoons, the Tabletop Credits method involved the use of physical letters and objects related to the theme of the cartoon. These objects were placed on a flat surface, usually a table, and arranged in such a way that they formed the names and roles of the production staff, such as the animators, producers, voice actors, and so on. Each credit would appear on screen for a few seconds before transitioning to the next one. To create this effect, photographers would snap a photo of the tabletop setup with the letters and objects in place. The objects and letters would then be rearranged for the subsequent credit, and another photograph would be taken. This process would be repeated for each of the required credits, creating multiple photographs that, when played in sequence, would form a coherent credit sequence. The Tabletop Credits method was notable for its creativity and level of detail. For example, a Popeye cartoon with a nautical theme might have the opening credits arranged with objects such as ropes, anchors, and buoys to enhance the nautical imagery in the viewer's mind. This style of presenting the credits made early Popeye cartoons stand out from other animations of that time. In conclusion, the Tabletop Credits technique used in early Popeye cartoons was an innovative approach to displaying information in the opening credits. By using stop-motion animation to create a dynamic and visually appealing sequence of images, Fleischer Studios was able to distinguish its cartoons from those produced by other animation studios during that era."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a summary based on this article: This is what happens when you make the Internet mad.      On Wednesday, a group of technology companies began an unusual form of protest: The firms shut down or replaced the content on their own popular Web sites with protest messages to show their unhappiness with two Internet-regulation bills grinding through Congress. They argue that the bills would impose huge regulatory costs and stifle innovation on the Web.      Around the country, Americans woke up without some of the oddball essentials of online life. No Wikipedia. No Reddit, a compendium of links to stories and funny pictures that draws millions a day. And no I Can Has Cheezburger?, the world’s best-known collection of funny cat pictures.      Related: How to get around the blackout      In Washington, however, Wednesday has another significance.      It culminates a surprising lobbying effort in which technology companies such as Twitter, Wikipedia and Google have used their massive reach into Americans’ daily lives as a political weapon, to whip up support from online users.      In this fight, they were pitted against traditional Washington heavyweights, such as Hollywood and the recording industry.      And even before the LOLcats went on strike, it seemed as though the tech companies were winning.      This fight is over two similar bills: the House’s Stop Online Piracy Act and the Senate’s Protect IP (intellectual property) Act. Both are meant to attack the problem of foreign Web sites that sell pirated or counterfeit goods. They would impose restrictions forcing U.S. companies to stop selling online ads to suspected pirates, processing payments for illegal online sales and refusing to list Web sites suspected of piracy in search-engine results.      The idea is to cut off the channels that deliver American customers, and their money, to potential pirates. But tech companies see the laws as a dangerous overreach, objecting because, they say, the laws would add burdensome costs and new rules that would destroy the freewheeling soul of the Internet.      “The voice of the Internet community has been heard,” Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.), who sided with the tech companies, said in a statement. Issa said he had already been told of a victory: GOP leaders told him that the House would not vote on a version of the bill that those companies oppose. “Much more education for Members of Congress about the workings of the Internet is essential.”      The biggest impact of Wednesday’s blackout may be in the shutdown of the English-language version of Wikipedia, which gets 2.7 billion U.S. visitors per month.      “It is the opinion of the English Wikipedia community that both of these bills, if passed, would be devastating to the free and open web,” said a statement signed by three of the free encyclopedia’s administrators, with the handles “NuclearWarfare,” “Risker” and “Billinghurst.” They said the decision to shut down the English-language portion of the site, starting at midnight Eastern time, had been made after a virtual discussion that involved 1,800 users.      But already, the momentum of the two controversial bills has been largely halted. Just weeks ago, they seemed on their way to passage, having cleared a Senate committee and garnered bipartisan support in the House.      Now, there is a bipartisan retreat. Sen. Benjamin L. Cardin (D-Md.), who co-sponsored an earlier version of the bill, has announced his opposition. Six Republicans on the same Senate committee — all of whom voted for the bill before — have written Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.) to ask that he slow the bill down, so it can be modified and considered later.      “We have increasingly heard from a large number of constituents and stakeholders with vocal concerns about possible unintended consequences of the proposed legislation,” the six wrote. They included Sen. Charles E. Grassley (Iowa), the ranking Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee.      In the back offices of the Senate, many longtime aides were amazed at how quickly a new lobbying force had managed to outmaneuver experienced heavyweights. Sites such as Wikipedia and Tumblr had encouraged users to contact legislators, resulting in a flood of unhappy calls.      One Republican aide said that “SOPA” had already become “a dirty word beyond anything you can imagine.”      Both of the bills would allow the Justice Department to seek an injunction in court, barring U.S. sites from processing payments for a rogue Web site, selling it ads or listing its link among search-engine results.      “There’s no fundamental First Amendment right to engage in thievery. Nor to advertise thievery,” said Howard Gantman, at the Motion Picture Association of America. He said that the Internet’s free-for-all nature should not allow U.S. companies impunity to deal with crooks.      “Do we want to have laws?” Gantman said. “Or do we want to just say it’s a free-for-all Wild West?”      In addition to the costs, however, the tech companies say they would have to police vast sites full of user-generated content. They also objected to a provision that would have stripped the rogue sites out of the Internet’s virtual phone book. If a U.S. user entered the Web address, it would appear the site didn’t exist.      That provision “says that we’re no longer committed to the idea that there’s one Web. We’re no longer committed to the idea that any one person, anywhere in the world, can reach any one site anywhere else in the world,” said Sherwin Siy, of the nonprofit advocacy group Public Knowledge.      Over the weekend, the tech companies won a major victory. White House officials signaled concerns about the phone-book provision. The bill’s sponsors had already said they would remove it.      But several companies say they still have significant problems with the bill. They say the bill spreads culpability too widely and could leave Web sites facing expensive legal fights for a single link to a site deemed to be “rogue.”      Instead, many companies have proposed an approach in which the Web sites could police themselves, overseen by an international nonprofit that tracks bad actors.      “This is an industry where you can start with a laptop and a good idea and make a billion-dollar company,” said Alexis Ohanian, the co-founder of Reddit.com. Ohanian said that if the new bill adds potential legal liabilities, the result could be less innovation on the Web.      Staff writers Paul Kane, Cecilia Kang, David Nakamura and Hayley Tsukayama contributed to this report. ||||| Thank you – and the more than 7 million other Americans – who stood up for the Web      Wednesday, January 18th was a big day for the Web. Americans stood up in opposition to PIPA and SOPA – bills that would censor the Web and impose harmful regulations on U.S. businesses. Many of your favorites sites went dark, Americans made thousands of phone calls to our elected representatives in Washington, and we asked you to raise your voice by petitioning Congress through this page.      Your voice is being heard. Your elected representatives are beginning to recognize the damage these bills could inflict on the Web, and as a result, votes on PIPA and SOPA have been delayed. But this debate is not yet won. We at Google remain committed to working to address the problem of piracy without compromising our freedoms and risking our industry’s track record of innovation and job creation.      Thank you for your support. As you can see, it has made a tremendous difference. ||||| Summary:","output":"Tech companies, such as Twitter, Wikipedia, and Google, united in protest against two Internet-regulation bills, the Stop Online Piracy Act (SOPA) and the Protect IP (Intellectual Property) Act, both of which were aimed at tackling foreign websites that sell pirated or counterfeit goods. The companies argued that the bills would stifle innovation and impose large regulatory costs; instead they proposed an alternative approach in which websites self-police, overseen by an international nonprofit that tracks bad actors. The protests led to the votes on SOPA and the Protect IP Act being delayed, but the debate regarding online piracy and its potential regulation remains ongoing."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Information:  - The Hui people (Xiao'erjing: ; Dungan: , \\"Xuejzw\\") are a Chinese ethnic group which is composed predominantly of adherents of the Muslim faith and found throughout China, though they are concentrated mainly in the Northwestern provinces of the country and the Zhongyuan.

In the problem, you want to find the value of 'k'. So, you need to do a few steps. First, you want to get 'k' on one side of the equation. We can start by moving '196' from the right side of the equation to the left side. To do that, we subtract '196' from both sides of the equation.  619 - 196 = -47*k This gives us 423 = -47*k. Next, we want to get 'k' all by itself. So, we need to divide each side of the equation by '-47'. 423 divided by -47 equals to 'k'.  If you do the division, you will find out that k equals to -9.

Leaving the wood natural in the kitchen maintained its rustic beauty and accentuated the rich grains and intricate patterns of the timber. This decision also provided a warm, welcoming ambiance that perfectly complements the space where our family and friends frequently gather to share meals, laughter, and meaningful conversations. In the kitchen, the natural wood effortlessly blends with the earth-toned color palette, which includes muted shades of browns and greens, combined with the timeless charm of the exposed brickwork and cozy, farmhouse-style décor. This harmonious fusion instills a sense of calmness and belonging, while also showcasing a unique character that is in tune with the architectural elements of our home. We also utilized a quality wood sealer to protect the natural wood against staining, spills, and everyday wear and tear, thus preserving the inherent beauty of the material over time. On the other hand, opting to paint over the wood in the bathroom provided a more practical and visually cohesive solution, given the high levels of moisture and humidity commonly found in that space. To ensure longevity and durability, we selected a high-quality, moisture-resistant paint that would properly protect the wooden surfaces from water damage and mold growth. This choice not only creates a brighter, airier atmosphere but also highlights the intricate details of the cabinetry, molding, and other woodwork within the bathroom. Painting the wood in the bathroom, while leaving it natural in the kitchen, also allowed us to play with different design styles and color schemes in each space. This helped us to create distinctive, yet complementary atmospheres that serve different functional and aesthetic purposes. In the bathroom, the use of paint provides a clean, fresh look that highlights the importance of cleanliness and well-being. Meanwhile, the kitchen benefits from the warm, nurturing properties of natural wood, which fosters a sense of connection and togetherness. In summary, our thoughtful decision to paint the wood in the bathroom and leave it untouched in the kitchen ultimately led to an elegant, multifaceted design approach, striking an ideal balance between practicality, aesthetics, and the thoughtful preservation of our home's original craftsmanship.

The Battle of Baltimore was fought between British invaders and American defenders in September 1814. During this battle, Francis Scott Key witnessed the British bombardment of the fort and was inspired to pen the lyrics of the \\"Star-Spangled Banner,\\" which later became the national anthem of the United States. In 1925, long after the Civil War, the site was designated a National Park, preserving its historical significance as a crucial battleground in the early years of the United States. In 1939, the area was re-designated as a \\"National Monument and Historic Shrine\\" under the care of the National Park Service. Fort McHenry is the only place in the United States to receive this unique dual title, highlighting its importance and the events that transpired under the leadership of several individuals like William W. Morris during the Civil War era. In summary, William W. Morris served as the commander of the place that would go on to become a designated National Park in 1925 and a \\"National Monument and Historic Shrine\\" in 1939 during the American Civil War. The historic site, Fort McHenry, holds exceptional importance in America's military history, as it played significant roles in the War of 1812 and the Civil War while also inspiring the nation's anthem."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You might need to use additional knowledge to answer the question. Breathing is the process of moving air into and out of the lungs. The process depends on a muscle called the diaphragm. This is a large, sheet-like muscle below the lungs. Inhaling, or breathing in, occurs when the diaphragm muscle tightens. This increases the size of the chest. This too decreases air pressure inside the lungs. This action allows air and gases to enter the lungs. Exhaling, or breathing out, occurs when the diaphragm muscle relaxes. This decreases the size of the chest. This increases air pressure inside the lungs. This action allows for air to leave the lungs. When you inhale, air enters the respiratory system through your nose and ends up in your lungs, where gas exchange with the blood takes place. What happens to the air along the way? In the nose, mucus and hairs trap any dust or other particles in the air. The air is also warmed and moistened. Next, air passes through a passageway that is connected to the windpipe. The air then finds its way to the lungs. In the chest, the windpipe splits so that air enters both the right and left lung.  Question: \\"What happens in the nose as air passes through to the lungs?\\" Answer: \\"Mucus and hairs trap any dust or other particles in the air\\" Is this answer correct? pick from the following. A). no. B). yes....I think the answer is","output":"B). yes The answer \\"Mucus and hairs trap any dust or other particles in the air\\" is correct because as air passes through the nose during inhalation, mucus and nasal hairs (cilia) work together to filter out dust, allergens, and other particles present in the air. This helps to protect the respiratory system from harmful substances and keeps the air clean before it reaches the lungs.  Answer A). no is not correct because it is true that mucus and hairs serve as a protective filter for incoming air. This natural filtration system is essential to our respiratory health, and the given answer correctly describes their function in the process of inhalation."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

However, you will forget this feeling when the car gets old. But if you spend a week traveling, it's more possible that you'll remember the great experience, and you'll remember the feeling for a long time. A new study has found that spending money on experiences makes people happier than on _ things. For material things, it's possible that you'll care about every little thing. If you buy a nice pen, and someone else buys one with less money, it's possible that you may be unhappy because you spend so much money. When it comes to experiences like trips, you won't think like that. If the experience is generally good, you will be happy with the price. Material things can be compared more easily. If you buy an MP3 and then see a more suitable one, you may regret buying the first one. However, if you have a nice dinner at one restaurant, and then learn about another better restaurant, you'll not regret the first meal. Material things can cause jealousy .For example, if you buy a new toy and find that your friend has a better toy, you'll feel unhappy. Instead, if you travel to a beautiful place, then no matter where your friends have gone, it won't make the memory of your trip less happy. Which of the following is WRONG according to the passage?

Let the guinea pig get used to you by speaking softly to it from a distance and approaching the cage slowly. Gradually, you can start placing your hand inside the cage without touching the guinea pig, allowing it to sniff and explore your hand on its own terms. This process helps to establish trust between you and your pet and sets the foundation for a positive relationship. Once your guinea pig appears comfortable and curious around your hand, you can gently try to pet it or scoop it up using both hands, supporting its body and hind legs to ensure its safety and comfort. When your guinea pig becomes more familiar and comfortable being handled by you, it is essential to give it playtime outside of the cage to encourage both physical and mental stimulation.

Please answer the following question: Two neighboring towns from Texas produced their food in different ways. Silver town was sustainable and didn't use any fertilizers or pesticides, while Gold town did.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which town caused more fertilizer runoff?  Hint: Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil. Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf. Answer:","output":"Given the information provided in the paragraph, the town that caused more fertilizer runoff is Gold town. The reason for this is that Gold town used fertilizers and pesticides in their agricultural production, whereas Silver town practiced sustainable methods and did not use any fertilizers or pesticides.  When it rains, the fertilizers in Gold town's soil are dissolved, and the runoff carries these chemicals away. The runoff, which contains high levels of nitrogen from the fertilizers, eventually ends up in bodies of water such as ponds and oceans. The excess nitrogen in the water leads to an overgrowth of algae, which in turn depletes the carbon dioxide within the water. Once the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue and use up all the available oxygen in the water. This process creates a dead zone, an area in a body of water where there is too little oxygen for any life to thrive, such as the large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico mentioned in the paragraph. In contrast, Silver town's sustainable agricultural practices do not contribute to fertilizer runoff, because they do not use any synthetic fertilizers or pesticides. Hence, it does not impact the water bodies negatively in the same manner as Gold town. Therefore, given the context, it is clear that Gold town caused more fertilizer runoff than Silver town, due to their conventional agricultural practices involving the use of fertilizers and pesticides, which subsequently leads to the formation of dead zones in bodies of water."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Nadia Elena Comaneci was born on November 12, 1961, in Onesti, which is a small town in the Carpathian Mountains, in Bacau County, Romania, in the historical region of Western Moldavia. Comaneci was born to Gheorghe and Stefania Comaneci, and has a younger brother. Her parents separated in the 1970s, and her father (1936-2012) later moved to Bucharest. She and her younger brother Adrian were raised in the faith of the Romanian Orthodox Church. \\"At Montreal [Comaneci] received four of her seven 10s on the uneven bars. The apparatus demands such a spectacular burst of energy in such a short time--only 23 seconds--that it attracts the most fanfare. But it is on the beam that her work seems more representative of her unbelievable skill. She scored three of her seven 10s on the beam. Her hands speak there as much as her body. Her pace magnifies her balance. Her command and distance hush the crowd.  On July 18, Comaneci made history at the 1976 Summer Olympics, when during the team compulsory portion of the competition, she was awarded the first perfect 10 in Olympic gymnastics for her routine on the uneven bars. However, Omega SA--the traditional Olympics scoreboard manufacturer-- was led to believe that it was impossible to receive a perfect ten, thus the scoreboard was not programmed to display that score. Comaneci's perfect 10 thus appeared as \\"1.00,\\" the only means by which the judges could indicate that she had indeed received a 10. The crowd was at first confused, but soon understood and gave her a rousing ovation.  During the remainder of the Montreal Games, Comaneci earned six additional tens. She won gold medals for the individual all-around, the balance beam and uneven bars. She also won a bronze for the floor exercise and a silver as part of the team all-around. Soviet gymnast Nellie Kim was her main rival during the Montreal Olympics; Kim became the second gymnast to receive a perfect ten for her performance on the vault. Comaneci also took over the spotlight from Olga Korbut, who had been the darling of the 1972 Munich Games.  Comaneci's achievements are pictured in the entrance area of Madison Square Garden in New York City, where she is shown presenting her perfect beam exercise.  Comaneci was the first Romanian gymnast to win the Olympic all-around title. She also holds the record for being the youngest Olympic gymnastics all-around champion ever. The sport has now revised its age-eligibility requirements. Gymnasts must now turn 16 in the same calendar year of the Olympics to compete during the Games. When Comaneci competed in 1976, gymnasts had to be 14 by the first day of the competition. Legally breaking this record is not currently possible. She was the BBC Overseas Sports Personality of the Year for 1976 and the Associated Press's 1976 \\"Female Athlete of the Year\\". Back home in Romania, Comaneci's success led her to be awarded the Sickle and Hammer Gold Medal, and named a Hero of Socialist Labor; she was the youngest Romanian to receive such recognition during the administration of Nicolae Ceausescu.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: What are some more achievements","output":"As the information provided does not include a specific article to reference, I will use the information provided to list some additional achievements of Nadia Comaneci: 1.
