Still, it rains and the air is cool. All he has to shelter him is a think nylon jacket. The jacket is soaked. It feels both chilly and coarse against his skin.

This term could be interpreted in different ways, depending on the context and the preferences of the reviewer. Some potential interpretations are: 1. If the reviewer enjoys films that feature multiple unrelated stories or favors a disjointed narrative style, the review might lean more towards positive. In this case, the term \\"unrelated shorts\\" could be regarded as a compliment, as the reviewer might appreciate the innovation and variety provided by the film's structure. 2. On the other hand, if the reviewer prefers films with a cohesive plot and clear connections between the different sequences, \\"unrelated shorts\\" might imply a negative opinion. This interpretation could mean that the movie lacks coherence and unity, making it unfulfilling for someone who values a linear structure. To determine whether the review has a positive or negative opinion about the movie, more context would be needed. The tone of the review, any accompanying text, or the scoring (if it involves points or stars) may give some clarity to the reviewer's stance.

Unfortunately, the attainment of such an all-consuming goal has not produced the peace and happiness that was expected. There was a dark side to success. Fairly recently, the question of balance and its impact on mental health and happiness has taken center stage in many circles of psychological research. Dozens of studies have been conducted and published on the subject as companies and individuals alike have noticed that their chaotic lifestyle has not produced the happiness they hoped to achieve. The cost has greatly outweighed the benefits. The majority of these studies agree on one thing – there is potential for incredible benefits from living a balanced life filled with interesting and varied experiences rather than living with an all-consuming focus on career. The studies also included some important findings about the effects of stress. Stress is not always detrimental to health and happiness. In fact, a bit of stress here and there is actually healthy, for both plants and animals – it stimulates growth and development. It depends on the source of the stress, how relentles it is, and how it is managed. The danger comes when relentless stress pounds the mind and body and the individuals accept it as the norm. They cope with it the best they can; but allow no time for recovery from the depletion of resources. Professional burnout from chronic stress debilitates the individual to the point that s/he can no longer function effectively on a personal or professional level. Psychology Today tells us that “Burnout is one of those road hazards in life that high-achievers really should be keeping a close eye out for, but sadly – often because of their “I can do everything” personalities, they rarely see it coming.” Why will stress be detrimental to a person? Pick the correct answer from the following options:  A. not enough information  B. Not allowing time for recovery  C. Focusing on varied and interesting life experiences  D.

After Saket Ram changes belief of Mahatma Gandhi, the assasin Nathuram Godse kills Ghandi.","output":"Title: The Shadow of Betrayal Genre: Drama, Thriller Set in British India in 1947, the movie revolves around the complex relationship between Mahatma Gandhi, Saket Ram, and Nathuram Godse, culminating in a mind-bending and emotionally stirring climax. Act 1: A Nation Divided The film opens with British India on the brink of gaining independence, with various political and religious factions at odds. The hardline, ambitious Saket Ram is a seasoned intelligence officer working for the British. Assigned to infiltrate Gandhi's inner circle, Saket forms a close bond with the deeply spiritual and altruistic leader. As Saket learns more about Gandhi's non-violent principles and his ultimate aim to unite the country through harmonious coexistence, he is profoundly affected. Despite his initial loathing towards the man, Saket slowly begins to embrace Gandhi's philosophy, and in one climactic scene, drapes himself in the Indian flag, symbolizing his newfound allegiance. Act 2: The Threat Looms Parallel to Saket's journey, we are introduced to Nathuram Godse, an extremist Hindu-nationalist with an unyielding belief in the sanctity of the Hindu religion. Eager to overthrow British rule and establish a purely Hindu state, Godse becomes increasingly enraged by Gandhi's calls for unity amongst all religious factions. As whispers of conspiracy float through the air, Saket, torn between his duty to the British and his loyalty to Gandhi, faces an impossible choice. He gathers intelligence on the brewing plot against Gandhi's life to prove his allegiance to his newfound mentor. As he unearths the dangerous web of intrigue surrounding the leader's enemies, Saket learns that Godse is the prime suspect in the assassination plot. Act 3: The Shadow of Betrayal With Godse tightening his grip around an unsuspecting Gandhi, Saket is given a final directive from his British superiors: Allow the assassination to proceed, or ensure Gandhi’s survival. Weighing the consequences, Saket makes the painful decision to abandon the British and protect his transformative mentor. In a thrilling race against time, Saket strategizes to protect Gandhi without blowing his cover. As January 30, 1948, approaches, Saket orchestrates a secret counterplot to divert Godse's attention, involving a handful of trusted confidants from within Gandhi’s circle and British intelligence. However, betrayal lurks in the shadow, and Godse catches wind of Saket's scheme. Confrontation and Climax On the fateful day, Saket, desperate to stop Godse, engages in a fierce rooftop chase to apprehend the assassin. In a heart-pounding nail-biting sequence, Saket manages to corner the determined extremist. A gripping exchange between the two men ensues, a battle of ideals, setting the stage for an unforgettable final moment. As they struggle, a gunshot rings through the air. Devastated, realizing his efforts were in vain, Saket races to where the heartbroken nation mourns the unthinkable – the assassination of their beloved Mahatma Gandhi. Epilogue In the aftermath, the film's powerful ending depicts a dejected Saket standing amidst the grieving masses. Seeming to make peace with his choice, he resolves to carry on Gandhi's legacy of unity and non-violence, despite the enormous cost it has taken upon him. “The Shadow of Betrayal” is a deeply emotional, intense thriller that explores the complexities of patriotism, loyalty, and the unwavering spirit of those who seek unity and understanding in a world divided."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Information:  - A nebula (Latin for \\"cloud\\"; pl. nebulae, nebulæ, or nebulas) is an interstellar cloud of dust, hydrogen, helium and other ionized gases. Originally, \\"nebula\\" was a name for any diffuse astronomical object, including galaxies beyond the Milky Way. The Andromeda Galaxy, for instance, was once referred to as the \\"Andromeda Nebula\\" (and spiral galaxies in general as \\"spiral nebulae\\") before the true nature of galaxies was confirmed in the early 20th century by Vesto Slipher, Edwin Hubble and others.  - In astronomy and physical cosmology, the metallicity or Z is the fraction of mass of a star or other kind of astronomical object that is not in hydrogen (X) or helium (Y). Most of the physical matter in the universe is in the form of hydrogen and helium, so astronomers use the word \\"metals\\" as a convenient short term for \\"all elements except hydrogen and helium\\". This usage is distinct from the usual physical definition of a solid metal. The rationale for the astronomical usage is that in the high-temperature and pressure environment of a star, atoms do not undergo chemical reactions and effectively have no chemical properties, including that of being a metal as usually understood. For example, stars and nebulae with relatively high abundances of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and neon are called \\"metal-rich\\" in astrophysical terms, even though those elements are non-metals in chemistry.  - AB Doradus Moving Group is a group of about 30 associated stars that are moving through space together with the star AB Doradus . A moving group is distinguished by its members having about the same age , composition ( or metallicity ) and motion through space . Hence they most likely formed in the same location . This group is located about 20 parsecs from the Earth and is the closest known co-moving group . The average space velocity of this group has components of U =  8 , V =  27 and W =  14 km / s. About 10 of these stars form a nuclear group within a volume roughly 10 parsecs across . The proximity of this moving group makes it useful for studies of shared stellar properties , as well as detection of companions through direct imaging . These can be used for refinement of young stellar models , for example .  - AB Doradus is a pre-main-sequence quadruple star system in the constellation Dorado. The primary is a flare star that shows periodic increases in activity.  - Dorado (English pronunciation: ) is a constellation in the southern sky. It was named in the late 16th century and is now one of the 88 modern constellations. Its name refers to the dolphinfish (\\"Coryphaena hippurus\\"), which is known as \\"dorado\\" in Portuguese, although it has also been depicted as a swordfish. Dorado contains most of the Large Magellanic Cloud, the remainder being in the constellation Mensa. The South Ecliptic pole also lies within this constellation.

Answer the following question: Process:  - Air is taken into the body via the nose or mouth - The air travels into the windpipe - The windpipe divides the air to the two lungs via the bronchial tubes - The lungs oxygenate the blood in the body - Carbon dioxide is filtered out by every cell in the body - The carbon dioxide is carried back to the lungs via the bloodstream - The carbon dioxide is exhaled.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the nasal passages are clear happens, how will it affect MORE oxygen being brought to the body.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"If the nasal passages are clear, it can facilitate more efficient air intake, as there will be less resistance and obstruction for the air to pass through. This can potentially lead to more oxygen being brought into the body, as a higher volume of air makes its way through the respiratory system. The perturbation, in this case, has a direct effect on the process. Clear nasal passages allow for easier and more efficient airflow, which in turn enhances the overall effectiveness of the oxygenation process. The increased airflow will enhance the amount of oxygen available for the lungs to oxygenate the blood, ultimately benefiting the whole body."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a question about this article: Zhejiang's main manufacturing sectors are electromechanical industries, textiles, chemical industries, food, and construction materials. In recent years Zhejiang has followed its own development model, dubbed the \\"Zhejiang model\\", which is based on prioritizing and encouraging entrepreneurship, an emphasis on small businesses responsive to the whims of the market, large public investments into infrastructure, and the production of low-cost goods in bulk for both domestic consumption and export. As a result, Zhejiang has made itself one of the richest provinces, and the \\"Zhejiang spirit\\" has become something of a legend within China. However, some economists now worry that this model is not sustainable, in that it is inefficient and places unreasonable demands on raw materials and public utilities, and also a dead end, in that the myriad small businesses in Zhejiang producing cheap goods in bulk are unable to move to more sophisticated or technologically more advanced industries. The economic heart of Zhejiang is moving from North Zhejiang, centered on Hangzhou, southeastward to the region centered on Wenzhou and Taizhou. The per capita disposable income of urbanites in Zhejiang reached 24,611 yuan (US3,603) in 2009, an annual real growth of 8.3%. The per capita pure income of rural residents stood at 10,007 yuan (US1,465), a real growth of 8.1% year-on-year. Zhejiang's nominal GDP for 2011 was 3.20 trillion yuan (US506 billion) with a per capita GDP of 44,335 yuan (US6,490). In 2009, Zhejiang's primary, secondary, and tertiary industries were worth 116.2 billion yuan (US17 billion), 1.1843 trillion yuan (US173.4 billion), and 982.7 billion yuan (US143.9 billion) respectively. What is the answer to this question: What is Zhejiang's own development model dubbed?","output":"Zhejiang's own development model is called the \\"Zhejiang model\\".

Pierre Benjamin Monteux (pronounced [pjɛʁ mɔ̃.tø]; 4 April 1875 – 1 July 1964) was a French (later American) conductor. After violin and viola studies, and a decade as an orchestral player and occasional conductor, he began to receive regular conducting engagements in 1907.  He came to prominence when, for Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes company between 1911 and 1914, he conducted the world premieres of Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring and other prominent works including Petrushka, Ravel's Daphnis et Chloé, and Debussy's Jeux. Thereafter he directed orchestras around the world for more than half a century. From 1917 to 1919 Monteux was the principal conductor of the French repertoire at the Metropolitan Opera in New York. He led the Boston Symphony Orchestra (1919–24), Amsterdam Concertgebouw Orchestra (1924–34), Orchestre Symphonique de Paris (1929–38) and San Francisco Symphony (1936–52).  In 1961, aged eighty-six, he accepted the chief conductorship of the London Symphony Orchestra, a post which he held until his death three years later.  Although known for his performances of the French repertoire, his chief love was the music of German composers, above all Brahms. He disliked recording, finding it incompatible with spontaneity, but he nevertheless made a substantial number of records. Monteux was well known as a teacher. In 1932 he began a conducting class in Paris, which he developed into a summer school that was later moved to his summer home in Les Baux in the south of France. After moving permanently to the US in 1942, and taking American citizenship, he founded a school for conductors and orchestral musicians in Hancock, Maine. Among his students in France and America who went on to international fame were Lorin Maazel, Igor Markevitch, Neville Marriner, Seiji Ozawa, André Previn  and David Zinman.

In the first sentence, \\"This computer will connect well to the network,\\" the emphasis is on the computer as an individual unit being able to establish a connection with a more extensive network, typically referring to the internet or a local area network (LAN). In this context, \\"connect\\" implies the act of successfully associating the computer with the network, ensuring proper communication, data transfer, and access to shared resources. It may involve various actions like plugging in an Ethernet cable, setting up a Wi-Fi connection, configuring network settings, and ensuring the computer is capable of communicating with other network devices or accessing the internet seamlessly. On the other hand, the second sentence, \\"Our computers connected together,\\" implies that all the computers being discussed are linked to each other, forming a collective unit. This can be understood as connecting multiple computers in a network, allowing them to interact, share resources, and communicate with each other. The focus is more on the unification of the computers in a closed setup that benefits all parties involved. This connection may be established by physical means like Ethernet cables or wirelessly through a router or other networking devices. In this sentence, \\"connect\\" might also involve the process of setting up shared folders, network printers, or file-sharing services to enhance collaboration and resource utilization among the computers. In conclusion, though the word \\"connect\\" means the same thing in both sentences, which is to join or link together, the contexts differ slightly. The first sentence focuses on a single computer establishing a connection with a network, while the second revolves around multiple computers networking with one another in a collective unit. These differences are subtle, but they emphasize various aspects of connectivity depending on the context."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Combine facts and answer this: Which came first: the birth of Rob Zombie or the formation of the band Wheatus?

Answer the following question: Article: Seven species of carp  native to Asia have been introduced into United States waters in recent decades, but it's four in particular-bighead, black, grass and silver-that worry ecologists, biologists, fishers and policymakers alike. Introduced in the southeast to help control weeds and parasites in aquaculture   operations, these fish soon spread up the Mississippi River system where they have been crowding out native fish populations not used to competing with such aggressive invaders. The carps' presence in such numbers is also harming water quality and killing off sensitive species. Asian carp are strong to jump over barriers such as low dams. They lay hundreds of thousands of eggs at a time and spread into new habitat quickly and easily. Also, flooding has helped the fish expand into previously unattainable water bodies. And fishers using young carp as live bait have also helped the fish's spread, as they have boats going through locks up and down the Mississippi. The federal government considers the Asian carps to be annoying species and encourages and supports \\"active control\\" by natural resources management agencies. Federal and state governments have spent millions in tax dollars to prevent the carp from making their way into the Great Lakes, but an underwater electric fence constructed to keep them out has not worked as well as hoped, and policymakers are reviewing other options now. In the meantime, state and federal agencies are monitoring the Mississippi and its branches for Asian carp and testing various barrier technologies to prevent their further spread. For instance, the National Park Service is cooperating with the state of Minnesota's Department of Natural Resources to construct new dams that are high enough to prevent Asian carp from jumping over. The Asian Carp Regional Coordinating Committee has funded DNA monitoring in potentially affected water bodies whereby researchers can determine whether the troublesome fish are present just by the biological footprints they leave behind.... Question: It is suggested from the passage that    _   . Yes or no, is the answer \\"both the state and the individuals can make efforts to keep out Asian carp\\"? Answer:","output":"Yes, the answer is \\"both the state and the individuals can make efforts to keep out Asian carp.\\" This can be inferred from the passage as it mentions the efforts by federal and state governments, natural resources management agencies, the National Park Service, and the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources. Additionally, individual fishers using young carp as live bait have contributed to the spread, implying that individual actions can also make a difference."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write highlights for this article: Big-spending English Premier League club Manchester City have completed the much-anticipated signing of Argentina international Carlos Tevez. Carlos Tevez faces competiton from seven other forwards in Manchester City's first-team squad. The 25-year-old was presented to the media on Tuesday afternoon ahead of City's departure the following day for a three-match pre-season tour of South Africa. City revealed on Monday night that the striker has agreed a five-year contract and would complete his move from bitter rivals Manchester United after passing a medical. A fee for the transfer has not yet been revealed, but it is reported that City have agreed to pay about 40 million to take over the player's ownership rights from the sports agencies which previously held them. Tevez denied claims by his former manager Alex Ferguson that he had decided to leave Old Trafford as long ago as January. Ferguson also said that he had offered the player a new contract on the night United played Inter Milan in the Champions League in March, but Tevez did not return his calls or text messages. \\"I was there for two years and Sir Alex never called or sent any text messages in that time,\\" Tevez told reporters through an interpreter. \\"The only time he spoke to me was after the Champions League final in Rome when I was going back to Argentina. It doesn't seem that this is the way to treat a player in two years at the club. It doesn't seem there is a line of communication. \\"It is United people talking about signing a contract (in January) but it is not true that it was decided then. I felt Sir Alex Ferguson and (United chief executive) David Gill did not do enough to try to keep me. \\"The fact I did not stay at United was not because of the fans. They must understand a part of my heart will always be with them. They were always extremely supportive, even when I wasn't playing.\\" City manager Mark Hughes confirmed that the club had been in contact with Arsenal over a move for Togo striker Emmanuel Adebayor, who has been linked with a 40 million move to Eastlands. \\"I think there's been discussions between ourselves and Arsenal but, as is my usual response about players that we haven't signed, really it's not the right time or place to discuss that -- only in as much as yes, there has been contact,\\" Hughes told reporters. \\"There's a deal to be done, possibly, but it's not been concluded as we speak. Until it actually happens, really it's not the time or the place to discuss it here.\\" The Mancunians have also made a huge offer for Chelsea captain John Terry, but the London club have insisted that the England defender is not for sale. \\"I have fantastic respect for John Terry, ever since I saw him as a young player when I was at Chelsea as a player myself,\\" Hughes said. \\"He's a great player and an outstanding captain. But he's very much a Chelsea player at this moment in time. I think any manager would covet a player of the type of John Terry, but at this moment in time he's a player for Chelsea, so we have to respect that.\\" The high-profile capture of Tevez is a big boost for the club and its billionaire Abu Dhabi-based owner, who was forced to end his long-running bid to sign Barcelona striker Samuel Eto'o. The Cameroon international, who had been offered a reported 400,000 a week wages, stalled on the move after being offered a new deal by the European champions, with some papers claiming he wanted a big chunk of any transfer fee paid by City. If Hughes does also sign Adebayor then the Welshman will have nine strikers at his disposal. The former Manchester United forward already has new 30 million signing Roque Santa Cruz, January's 23 million acquisition Craig Bellamy and Brazil star Robinho -- who arrived a year ago in a British-record 58 million coup. Felipe Caicedo, Valeri Bojinov, Benjani Mwaruwari and Ched Evans have also been given shirt numbers -- Tevez will wear No. 32 -- in a 57-strong squad named ahead of the new season. Hughes has released former England international striker Darius Vassell, while England Under-20 forward Daniel Sturridge has joined Chelsea for a fee to be resolved by a tribunal. Tevez scored 19 goals in 63 appearances for Premier League champions United after joining from West Ham, who he controversially saved from relegation despite a furor over his part-ownership with agent Kia Joorabchian's MSI Group. He has won 50 international caps, and has recently returned from holidays following Argentina's latest World Cup qualifiers. Tevez, who has won an Olympic gold medal, is the only man to be named South American Player of the Year in three successive seasons.","output":"Manchester City, a big-spending soccer club, signed Carlos Tevez, a famous player from Argentina. Carlos is 25 years old and he joined the team after agreeing to a five-year contract. He will be playing alongside other talented players in the team. The fans are excited about this new addition and the team is looking forward to playing their games.

But if I went to my local Apple Store, I'd get to spend only a few minutes testing out the machine. I wanted more time than that, so I rented one for 15 a day from a guy on SnapGoods. The Internet start-up in Brooklyn runs on simple reasoning: there are people who want to borrow stuff - camping equipment, food processors, robot vacuums, etc. - and there are people who have stuff they want to lend. SnapGoods helps these two groups connect over the Web. SnapGoods is one of many sites that have sprung up to facilitate offline sharing. Some sites have a narrow, obvious focus (like SwapBabyGoods.com) while others are more obscure (Neighborhood Fruit helps people share what's growing in their yards or find fruit trees on public land).

Renting something you don't need to use very often makes a lot more sense than buying it and letting it collect dust in your garage. There's a green aspect as well, since sharing helps cut down on overall use of resources. But one of collaborative consumption's most surprising benefits turns out to be social.

Question: \\"What does Portugal border?\\"  Context: \\"Portugal's colonial history has long since been a cornerstone of its national identity, as has its geographic position at the south-western corner of Europe, looking out into the Atlantic Ocean. It was one of the last western colonial European powers to give up its overseas territories (among them Angola and Mozambique in 1975), turning over the administration of Macau to the People's Republic of China at the end of 1999. Consequently, it has both influenced and been influenced by cultures from former colonies or dependencies, resulting in immigration from these former territories for both economic and/or personal reasons. Portugal, long a country of emigration (the vast majority of Brazilians have Portuguese ancestry), has now become a country of net immigration, and not just from the last Indian (Portuguese until 1961), African (Portuguese until 1975), and Far East Asian (Portuguese until 1999) overseas territories. An estimated 800,000 Portuguese returned to Portugal as the country's African possessions gained independence in 1975. By 2007, Portugal had 10,617,575 inhabitants of whom about 332,137 were legal immigrants.\\"  Answer: A:","output":"Portugal, located in the southwestern part of Europe, shares its border with only one country - Spain. With the Atlantic Ocean to the west and south, Portugal's geographic position has played a significant role in influencing its history, culture, and economy. Throughout its colonial history, Portugal established various overseas territories, occupying territories in Africa, Asia, and South America. The colonization of these territories enabled the exchange of culture, resources, and people, shaping Portugal's national identity and its relationships with these regions. Angola and Mozambique in Africa were among these overseas territories. In 1975, they gained independence from Portugal, leading to an influx of about 800,000 Portuguese returning to the mainland. Similarly, Macau, a territory in the Far East Asia, was handed over to the People's Republic of China in 1999, ending Portugal's colonial administration in the region. The Indian territory of Goa was also under Portuguese rule until 1961. These historical ties with former colonies and dependencies have resulted in immigration from these territories to Portugal for both economic and personal reasons. Once a country of emigration, Portugal has transformed into a country of net immigration. By 2007, the total population of Portugal was 10,617,575, with approximately 332,137 legal immigrants. The influence of various cultures and peoples from these former territories has enriched Portugal's diverse cultural landscape. Ties with Brazil, for instance, contribute to the vast majority of Brazilians having Portuguese ancestry. This blend of cultures and the historical impact of Portugal's colonial endeavors continue to play a significant role in shaping the country's national identity and its relationship with these regions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

With members John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr, they became widely regarded as the foremost and most influential act of the rock era. Rooted in skiffle, beat, and 1950s rock and roll, the Beatles later experimented with several musical styles, ranging from pop ballads and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock, often incorporating classical elements and unconventional recording techniques in innovative ways. In the early 1960s, their enormous popularity first emerged as \\"Beatlemania\\", but as the group's music grew in sophistication, led by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney, they came to be perceived as an embodiment of the ideals shared by the counterculture of the 1960s.  - Portland Bill is a narrow promontory (or bill) at the southern end of the Isle of Portland, and the southernmost point of Dorset, England.

The object is moved in small increments between individually photographed frames, creating the illusion of movement when the series of frames is played as a fast sequence. Dolls with movable joints or clay figures are often used in stop motion for their ease of repositioning. Stop motion animation using plasticine is called clay animation or \\"clay-mation\\". Not all stop motion requires figures or models; many stop motion films can involve using humans, household appliances and other things for comedic effect. Stop motion using objects is sometimes referred to as object animation.  - Norman Rossington (24 December 1928  21 May 1999) was an English actor best remembered for his roles in \\"The Army Game\\", the \\"Carry On\\" films and the Beatles' film \\"A Hard Day's Night\\".  - The Adventures of Portland Bill was a British stop motion animated children 's television series made in 1983 .

To conquer the land and enslave its people. Answer:","output":"Title: The Shadow of Entharia Plot Summary: 'The Shadow of Entharia' is a dark fantasy-adventure film set in the magical realm of Entharia. The story follows the plight of the people as they face the tyrannical rule of the evil Queen Seraphine, who uses her mastery of black magic to conquer the land and enslave its free-willed citizens. A group of unlikely heroes, each possessing unique skills and abilities, must come together to put an end to Queen Seraphine's reign of terror and restore peace and freedom to their homeland. Act 1: The film begins by introducing the enchanting world of Entharia, a land inhabited by various tribes with diverse magical abilities. Peace and harmony reign supreme until the sudden appearance of the evil Queen Seraphine. In her relentless pursuit of power, Seraphine uses her vast knowledge of black magic, including necromancy and blood rituals, to create an unstoppable army of shadow creatures and enslave key citizens to do her bidding. As Entharia falls under the dark cloud of Queen Seraphine's tyranny, a band of rebels starts forming in secret to resist her rule. The group includes: Rowan, a skilled swordsman and former captain of the Queen's Guard; Elara, a young but powerful sorceress who escaped Seraphine's grasp; Brax, a cunning thief and master of deception; and Nara, a legendary archer and beastmaster with unparalleled command over nature. Act 2: The rebel alliance learns of an ancient prophecy foretelling the rise of a powerful sorceress and her fall at the hands of a hero born from the ashes of her destruction. Believing that Elara is the sorceress from the prophecy and Rowan the destined hero, they set out on a perilous journey to locate the fabled 'Tears of Esariel,' a magical artifact said to possess the power to break the hold of Seraphine's black magic. As the rebels navigate treacherous landscapes, bloodthirsty minions, and deadly traps set to sabotage their mission, they also encounter various allies – a reclusive hermit skilled in ancient magic, a nomadic tribe of mystics commanding the ancient spirits, and a formidable legion of warriors from the southern regions of Entharia. Together, this united front against the evil queen gains strength. Meanwhile, Queen Seraphine, aware of the growing rebellion and the prophecy, stops at nothing to hunt down the heroes, using her dark powers to manipulate and control their actions. She even goes as far as resurrecting fallen enemies and summoning hellish creatures to challenge the rebels at every turn. Act 3: The rebels finally discover the hidden temple containing the Tears of Esariel and are faced with a series of insurmountable challenges to unlock its power. The climax of the story unfolds as the heroes face off against Queen Seraphine. Brax and Nara sacrifice themselves to save the others and help ensure their chance of victory. As Elara utilizes the power of the Tears, her magic becomes even more potent, combining with the united strength of the rebel alliance. Ultimately, it is Rowan's unwavering courage and devotion that strike the final blow against Queen Seraphine, freeing Entharia from the curse of her black magic forever. In the aftermath, the people of Entharia learn from their hardships and vow to protect and uphold the values of peace, unity, and freedom as they rebuild their once-thriving realm. The heroes part ways, each beginning new journeys to explore the world and share their newfound wisdom. The final scene hints at a possible new leader for the revitalized region, suggesting hope for a prosperous future. The Shadow of Entharia is a thrilling blend of dark fantasy, action, and adventure that explores themes of personal sacrifice, resilience, and the power of unity in the face of overwhelming odds.

Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: The U.S. has long had the unenviable distinction of holding the world's largest prison population, in part because of tough-on-crime policies enacted in the 1990s. But sentencing reforms passed in recent years appear to have made a dent, leading to declines in the population over the past eight years. A criminal justice reform organization reported Friday that in 2017, the U.S. prison population dropped below 1.5 million for the first time in more than a decade. The decline, according to the Washington-based Vera Institute for Justice, was driven by a sharp decrease in the number of inmates in federal prisons and decreases in several states with large prison populations. Total U.S. prison population dropped to 1,486,000 last year, a decline of nearly 16,000. The number of federal prisoners fell to 183,000, and the number of inmates in state prisons declined to 1.3 million, according to the report. (The overall figure does not include the more than 600,000 defendants held in local, state and federal jails.) The decline extended an eight-year downward trend in U.S. prison population that has been driven by federal and state sentencing reforms enacted over the past decade. But the Vera institute cautioned that it was unclear whether the trend would continue. \\"Whether criminal justice reform can continue to fuel this sustained decline in the prison population remains to be seen,\\" said Jacob Kang-Brown, senior research associate at Vera. \\"We must continue to do the hard work, as advocates and agents of change, to ensure that all our communities feel the relief of decarceration.\\" The report came as President Donald Trump called on Congress to pass legislation to help former inmates reintegrate into society and avoid going back to prison, as many do. \\"We want former inmates to find a path to success so they can support their families and support their communities,\\" Trump said at a White House summit on prison reform attended by two state governors and Jared Kushner, the president's son-in-law, who is spearheading... Question: What is the topic of the legislation Trump wants to pass? Options: - Decarceration relief - Criminal Justice - Prison reform. - not enough information The answer to this question is:","output":"Prison reform."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Given the following context:  Since the abolition of bishops within the Scottish Church in 1689, ownership of the abandoned cathedral fell to the crown, but no attempt to halt the decline of the building took place. Acknowledging the necessity to stabilise the structure, the Elgin Town Council initiated the reconstruction of the perimeter wall in 1809 and cleared debris from the surrounding area in about 1815. The Lord Provost of Elgin petitioned the King's Remembrancer for assistance to build a new roof for the chapterhouse and in 1824, £121 was provided to the architect Robert Reid for its construction. Reid was significant in the development of a conservation policy for historical buildings in Scotland and was to become the first Head of the Scottish Office of Works (SOW) in 1827. It was probably during his tenure at the SOW that the supporting buttresses to the choir and transept walls were built.In 1824 John Shanks, an Elgin shoemaker and an important figure in the conservation of the cathedral, started his work. Sponsored by local gentleman Isaac Forsyth, Shanks cleared the grounds of centuries of rubbish dumping and rubble. Shanks was officially appointed the site's Keeper and Watchman in 1826. Although his work was highly valued at the time and brought the cathedral back into public focus, his unscientific clearance work may have resulted in much valuable evidence of the cathedral's history being lost. He died on 14 April 1841, aged 82. A fortnight later, the Inverness Courier published a commemorative piece on Shanks, calling him the \\"beadle or cicerone of Elgin Cathedral\\", and writing: Some minor works took place during the remainder of the 19th century and continued into the early 20th century. During the 1930s further maintenance work followed that included a new roof to protect the vaulted ceiling of the south choir aisle. From 1960 onwards the crumbling sandstone blocks were replaced and new windows were fitted in the chapterhouse, which was re-roofed to preserve its vaulted ceiling. From 1988 to 2000, the two western towers...  answer the following question:  What is the publication that called the Elgin shoemaker the \\"beadle or cicerone of Elgin Cathedral\\"?

That way if your kite line breaks, your kite won’t sink down into the water. Any kind of medium-sized balloon will work. Use a small piece of wiring to secure the tied knot at the end of the balloon to one of the bars on your kite before you go out fishing. Don't inflate the balloon too much or it could pop. The kite line is the line coming off your kite rod. To connect your kite to the line, take your kite swivel (the small metal ring at the end of the lines on your kite) and hook it into the ball-bearing swivel at the end of your kite line. You’ll need to unclasp the ball-bearing swivel and then close it again around the swivel on your kite. Hold the kite by the edge of the boat or shoreline and release the line spooled on your kite reel. When you feel the kite getting pulled away from you by the wind, let go of it. Watch as your kite soars into the air, and stop the line using your kite reel once the kite is about 75 feet (23 m) away.  The distance of the kite doesn't need to be exact — you can just estimate. Once your kite is in the air and your kite rod is locked, you don't need to worry about flying it. Now that your kite is in the air, you need to attach a clip to the kite line so you can get your bait line clipped in. Follow the instructions that came with your kite release clip kit to get your clip assembled and on the line. You want the clip to be close to the kite rod for now so you can easily clip in your bait line later. Summary:","output":"1.

All we've done is checked that the first two creditors divided their collective share of 125 appropriately Does it follow that \\"The creditors are not allocating their shares correctly.\\"?","output":"To determine whether the statement \\"The creditors are not allocating their shares correctly\\" follows from the given information, it is crucial to first understand the context and situation in detail. So far, we know that there were at least two creditors who divided their collective share of 125. We don't have the information regarding the total amount to be distributed among creditors or the individual percentages or shares each creditor is entitled to receive. Therefore, we cannot conclude that the creditors are not allocating their shares correctly based solely on the information provided. To determine whether the allocation of shares is correct or not, we will need the following additional information: 1. The total amount of debt to be allocated among creditors: This is the sum of the principal amount and any interest, legal costs, or other charges. Knowing the total amount of debt to be distributed will help us gauge if the 125 allocated to the first two creditors is proportionally correct, given their respective shares. 2. The individual shares or percentages of the creditors: The proportion of the total debt that each creditor is entitled to will help us determine if the 125 allocated to the first two creditors is accurate. We will need to know the exact percentages or proportions allocated to each creditor based on their claims. 3. The actual allocation procedure: It is essential to know the agreed-upon order, priority, or process of sharing debts among the creditors. This might include the priority of statutory or secured creditors, the order of distributing funds to different creditors, and any agreements or legally binding rulings regarding the allocation to specific creditors. Once we have the information mentioned above, we can analyze the allocation of the 125 share to the first two creditors and determine if they allocated their shares correctly or not. If there is a discrepancy in the allocated amounts or the procedure is not followed, we can conclude that the creditors are not allocating their shares correctly.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What cast included Norman Bailey, Rita Hunter and Alberto Remedios?, using the article: The company, retaining the title \\"Sadler's Wells Opera\\", opened at the Coliseum on 21 August 1968, with a new production of Mozart's Don Giovanni, directed by Sir John Gielgud. Though this production was not well received, the company rapidly established itself with a succession of highly praised productions of other works. Arlen died in January 1972, and was succeeded as managing director by Lord Harewood.The success of the 1968 Mastersingers was followed in the 1970s by the company's first Ring cycle, conducted by Goodall, with a new translation by Andrew Porter and designs by Ralph Koltai.  The cast included Norman Bailey, Rita Hunter and Alberto Remedios. In Harewood's view, among the highlights of the first ten years at the Coliseum were the Ring, Prokofiev's War and Peace, and Richard Strauss's Salome and Der Rosenkavalier. The company's musical director from 1970 to 1977 was Charles Mackerras. Harewood praised his exceptional versatility, with a range \\"from The House of the Dead to Patience.\\" Among the operas he conducted for the company were Handel's Julius Caesar starring Janet Baker and Valerie Masterson; five Janáček operas; The Marriage of Figaro with pioneering use of 18th century performing style; Massenet's Werther; Donizetti's Mary Stuart with Baker; and Sullivan's Patience. The company took the production of the last to the Vienna Festival in 1975, along with Britten's Gloriana. Sir Charles Groves succeeded Mackerras as musical director from 1978 to 1979, but Groves was unwell and unhappy during his brief tenure. Starting in 1979, Mark Elder succeeded Groves in the post, and described Groves \\"immensely encouraging and supportive\\".A long-standing concern of Arlen and then Harewood was the need to change the company's name to reflect the fact that it was no longer based at Sadler's Wells theatre. Byam Shaw commented \\"The one major setback the Sadler's Wells Opera Company suffered from its transplant was that unheeding taxi drivers kept on taking their patrons up to Rosebery Avenue\\".Harewood..., what would be the answer ?

Little did he know, an ancient and mysterious secret lies within the walls, hidden for centuries. As Miles settles into his new life, he begins to discover odd cryptic messages, eerie symbols, and antique artifacts hidden throughout the mansion. Frequent ghostly occurrences keep Miles on edge as he unearths hidden rooms, dusty family heirlooms, and whispers of a dark past, particularly revolving around a clan of powerful and malicious witches, who reportedly met their end on the mansion's grounds. Intrigued, Miles begins researching the legends and finds out that the witches were trapped in a parallel dimension. One night, in a beautifully twisted turn of events, Miles, with Felize by his side, uncovers a magical tome that unknowingly releases the spirits of the witches into the mortal realm. The once-docile town is now plagued by a series of terrifying and inexplicable events, revealing the true nature of the witch clan. Fueled by an insidious, sinister power, the witches devise a plan to regain their physical forms and dominate the world. Miles notices Felix displaying strange behavior, and it becomes clear these witches need a unique host to reclaim their mortal bodies.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Which entity is this text about? Emilie Autumn Liddell (born on September 22, 1979), better known by her stage name Emilie Autumn, is an American singer-songwriter, poet, violinist, and actress. Autumn's musical style has been described by her as \\"Fairy Pop\\", \\"Fantasy Rock\\" or \\"Victoriandustrial\\". It is influenced by glam rock and from plays, novels, and history, particularly the Victorian era. Performing with her all-female backup dancers As part of a recording project, Autumn traveled to Chicago, Illinois, in 2001, and decided to stay because she enjoyed the public transportation system and music scene there. She released the 2001 EP Chambermaid while finishing Enchant--she alternatively labeled the musical style on Chambermaid as \\"fantasy rock\\" and cabaret--and wrote the 2001 charity single \\"By the Sword\\" after the events of September 11, 2001. According to her, the song is about strength, not violence; the act of swearing by the sword represents \\"an unbreakable promise to right a wrong, to stay true\\".  On February 26, 2003, she released her concept album Enchant, which spanned multiple musical styles: \\"new-age, pop and trip hop chamber music\\". Written during her late teenage years, Enchant revolved around the supernatural realm and its effect on the modern-day world. Autumn labeled it as \\"fantasy rock\\", which dealt with \\"dreams and stories and ghosts and faeries who'll bite your head off if you dare to touch them\\". The faery-themed \\"Enchant Puzzle\\" appeared on the artwork of the album; her reward for the person who would solve it consisted of faery-related items. Her bandmates consisted of cellist Joey Harvey, drummer Heath Jansen, guitarist Ben Lehl, and bassist Jimmy Vanaria, who also worked on the electronics. At the same time of Enchant's release, Autumn had several side projects: Convent, a musical group for which she recorded all four voices; Ravensong, \\"a classical baroque ensemble\\" that she formed with friends in California; and The Jane Brooks Project, which she dedicated to the real-life, 16th-century Jane Brooks--a woman executed for witchcraft.  On the night of the Enchant release party, Autumn learned that Courtney Love had invited her to record an album, America's Sweetheart, and embark on the tour to promote it. Contributing violin and vocals, Autumn appeared in Love's backing band The Chelsea--Radio Sloan, Dvin Kirakosian, Samantha Maloney, and Lisa Leveridge--on the 2004 tour. Much of Autumn's violin work did not get released on the album; she commented: \\"This had to do entirely with new producers taking over the project after our little vacation in France, and carefully discarding all of our sessions.\\" She performed live with Love and The Chelsea on Late Show with David Letterman on March 17, 2004, and at Bowery Ballroom the next day. In September 2004, her father died from lung cancer, even though he had quit smoking twenty years earlier. Near the end of 2004, she was filmed for an appearance on an episode of HGTV's Crafters Coast to Coast, showing viewers how to create faery wings and sushi-styled soap--both products she sold in her online \\"web design and couture fashion house\\", WillowTech House. On December 23, 2004, she appeared on the Chicago-based television station WGN as part of the string quartet backing up Billy Corgan and Dennis DeYoung's duet of \\"We Three Kings\\".","output":"This text is about Emilie Autumn Liddell, who is better known by her stage name, Emilie Autumn.

Socialite Ching (Angelica Lee), who also attended the party, identified Ling (Karena Lam) as the prime suspect because she found out that Ling was the only stranger presented in the ball room. She is unknown to everyone in the party, even to the hotel staff. During the police investigation, Ching discovers that Ling has been secretly involved with her boyfriend Wai (Andy Hui Chi-On), and this is the very reason why she was in the hotel when the crime was committed.

This event sets off a chain of events, suspicion, and intrigue that form the basis of the movie's plot. The central conflict revolves around the relationship between the two main characters, Ching and Ling. Ching, a wealthy socialite who attended the party, becomes suspicious of Ling, identifying her as the only stranger present in the ballroom during the party. During the police investigation, Ching discovers that Ling has been secretly involved with her boyfriend, Wai, which potentially provides a motive for Ling's presence at the hotel when the crime occurred. Despite being released uncharged due to insufficient evidence, Ling starts stalking Ching in a twisted game of jealousy. Ching initially sees this as harassment but turns the tables and begins to follow Ling instead. Ling seemingly allows this, showing Ching the darker side of life for someone from a less privileged background. The two engage in a subtle cat-and-mouse game, with Ching fearing for her life when Ling begins threatening to remove her kidney as well. The story takes a turn when Ching is kidnapped by a mysterious man who appears to be aligned with Ling. Ching reveals that her kidney is weak and would not hold much value on the black market. She passes out and later wakes up to find Ling injured beside her. This event brings the two women closer, as Ching discovers that Ling is actually kind-hearted and genuine in comparison to her superficial socialite friends. Ching learns that Ling has a childhood sweetheart, whose identity remains a mystery. Ching and Ling ultimately strike a deal with the mysterious man in an effort to secure a kidney for Ching. However, the police have been informed beforehand and arrive on the scene. The film continues to unravel the intricate web of relationships, deception, and uncovering the truth behind the surgically removed kidney.

Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history.  - A country is a region that is identified as a distinct national entity in political geography. A country may be an independent sovereign state or one that is occupied by another state, as a non-sovereign or formerly sovereign political division, or a geographic region associated with sets of previously independent or differently associated people with distinct political characteristics. Regardless of the physical geography, in the modern internationally accepted legal definition as defined by the League of Nations in 1937 and reaffirmed by the United Nations in 1945, a resident of a country is subject to the independent exercise of legal jurisdiction.  - Boxmeer ( pronunciation ) is a municipality and a town in the southern Netherlands .

Question: Who confronts Mrs. Appleyard Movie plot title: Picnic at Hanging Rock Movie plot: At Appleyard College, a girls' private school, near the town of Woodend, Victoria, Australia, the students are dressing on the morning of St. Valentine's Day, 1900. Miranda (Anne-Louise Lambert), Irma (Karen Robson), Marion (Jane Vallis), Rosamund (Ingrid Mason), waifish Sara (Margaret Nelson), and outsider Edith (Christine Schuler) read poetry and Valentine's Day cards. The group prepares for a picnic to a local geological formation known as Hanging Rock, accompanied by the mathematics mistress Miss Greta McCraw (Vivean Gray) and the young and beautiful Mlle. de Poitiers (Helen Morse). On the authority of the stern headmistress Mrs. Appleyard (Rachel Roberts), jittery teacher Miss Lumley (Kirsty Child) advises Sara that she is not allowed to attend. Driven by buggy operator Ben Hussey (Martin Vaughan), the party pass through and arrive at the Rock by mid-afternoon. After a meal, Mr. Hussey notes his watch has stopped at the stroke of twelve, as has the watch of Miss McCraw. With permission from Mlle. de Poitiers, Miranda, Marion and Irma decide to explore Hanging Rock and take measurements, with Edith allowed to follow. The group is observed several minutes later by a young Englishman, Michael Fitzhubert (Dominic Guard), who is lunching at the Rock with his uncle Colonel Fitzhubert (Peter Collingwood), aunt Mrs. Fitzhubert (Olga Dickie), and valet Albert (John Jarratt). At the top of Hanging Rock, the group lies on the ground, apparently dazed by the sun. Miss McCraw, still at the base of the Rock, stares up. Miranda, Marion, and Irma awake and move, as if in a dream, into a recess in the rock face. Edith screams and flees down the Rock. The distraught and hysterical party eventually returns to the College, where Mlle. de Poitiers explains to Mrs. Appleyard that Miss McCraw has been left behind.

In 1967 Solti was invited to become music director of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. It was the second time he had been offered the post. The first had been in 1963 after the death of the orchestra's conductor, Fritz Reiner, who made its reputation in the previous decade. Solti told the representatives of the orchestra that his commitments at Covent Garden made it impossible to give Chicago the eight months a year they sought. He suggested giving them three and a half months a year and inviting Carlo Maria Giulini to take charge for a similar length of time. The orchestra declined to proceed on these lines. When Solti accepted the orchestra's second invitation it was agreed that Giulini should be appointed to share the conducting. Both conductors signed three-year contracts with the orchestra, effective from 1969.One of the members of the Chicago Symphony described it to Solti as \\"the best provincial orchestra in the world.\\" Many players remained from its celebrated decade under Reiner, but morale was low, and the orchestra was 5m in debt. Solti concluded that it was essential to raise the orchestra's international profile. He ensured that it was engaged for many of his Decca sessions, and he and Giulini led it in a European tour in 1971, playing in ten countries. It was the first time in its 80-year history that the orchestra had played outside of North America. The orchestra received plaudits from European critics, and was welcomed home at the end of the tour with a ticker-tape parade.The orchestra's principal flute player, Donald Peck, commented that the relationship between a conductor and an orchestra is difficult to explain: \\"some conductors get along with some orchestras and not others. We had a good match with Solti and he with us.\\" Peck's colleague, the violinist Victor Aitay said, \\"Usually conductors are relaxed at rehearsals and tense at the concerts. Solti is the reverse. He is very tense at rehearsals, which makes us concentrate, but relaxed during the performance, which is a great asset to the...

While selling produce at a local market, Ned sells marijuana to a uniformed police officer due to the officer's claim that he had a stressful week, which made Ned feel sympathetic after initially being skeptical. Ned is then arrested on a charge of selling drugs. Ned has three sisters: Miranda (Elizabeth Banks) is a journalist for Vanity Fair trying to get her first major article published. Though she has trouble finding a man to keep her interest, she and a neighbor, Jeremy (Adam Scott) have hidden feelings for each other. Natalie (Zooey Deschanel), is an independent, bisexual hipster living with her girlfriend, Cindy (Rashida Jones), and five other roommates. Liz (Emily Mortimer), the oldest, is married to Dylan (Steve Coogan), a documentary filmmaker. Their marriage is failing as Dylan shows no sexual or emotional interest in Liz. They also have strict control over their son River (Matthew Mindler), which leaves him unhappy and unable to express himself.

The term \\"sousveillance\\", coined by Steve Mann, stems from the contrasting French words \\"sur\\", meaning \\"above\\", and \\"sous\\", meaning \\"below\\", i.e. \\"surveillance\\" denotes the \\"eye-in-the-sky\\" watching from above, whereas \\"sousveillance\\" denotes bringing the camera or other means of observation down to human level, either physically (mounting cameras on people rather than on buildings), or hierarchically (ordinary people doing the watching, rather than higher authorities or architectures doing the watching).  - The Corps of Royal Marines (RM) is the United Kingdom's amphibious light infantry force, forming part of the Naval Service, along with the Royal Navy. The Royal Marines were formed in 1755 as the Royal Navy's infantry troops. However, the marines can trace their origins back to the formation of the English Army's \\"Duke of York and Albany's maritime regiment of Foot\\" at the grounds of the Honourable Artillery Company on 28 October 1664.  - The Honourable Artillery Company (HAC) was incorporated by Royal Charter in 1537 by King Henry VIII and is considered one of the oldest military organisations in the world. Today it is a registered charity whose purpose is to attend to the \\"better defence of the realm\\", this purpose is primarily achieved by the support of the HAC Regiment and a detachment of Special Constabulary to the City of London Police. The word \\"artillery\\" in \\"Honourable Artillery Company\\" does not have the current meaning that is generally associated with it, but dates from a time when in the English language that word meant any projectile, including for example arrows shot from a bow. The equivalent form of words in modern English would be either \\"Honourable Infantry Company\\" or \\"Honourable Military Company.\\"  - Behavior is the range of actions and mannerisms made by individuals, organisms, systems, or artificial entities in conjunction with themselves or their environment, which includes the other systems or organisms around as well as the (inanimate) physical environment. It is the response of the system or organism to various stimuli or inputs, whether internal or external, conscious or subconscious, overt or covert, and voluntary or involuntary.  - The 30 Commando Information Exploitation Group is a Royal Marines unit of the British Armed Forces . The unit resources include communications , information operations , information systems , intelligence , surveillance , and Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance ( ISTAR ) . It is a redesignation of the former brigade headquarters battalion , the UK Landing Force Command Support Group , which was previously known as HQ & Signals Squadron RM. The unit 's title harks back to the original 30 Commando ( which in turn became 30 Assault Unit RM ) , formed in 1942 . This unit was tasked to move ahead of advancing Allied forces , or to undertake covert infiltrations into enemy territory by land , sea or air , to capture much needed intelligence , in the form of codes , documents , equipment or enemy personnel . In 2013 , 30 Commando Information Exploitation Group were granted the freedom of Littlehampton , West Sussex , in honour of the original unit being based in the town during the Second World War .  - The Crown dependencies are three territories of the United Kingdom: the Isle of Man in the Irish Sea, and the Bailiwicks of Jersey and Guernsey in the English Channel. Being independently administered jurisdictions, they do not form part of either the United Kingdom or the British Overseas Territories. They are self-governing possessions of the Crown (defined uniquely in each jurisdiction). Internationally, the dependencies are considered \\"territories for which the United Kingdom is responsible\\" rather than as sovereign states. As a result, they are not member states of the Commonwealth of Nations. However, they do have a relationship with the Commonwealth, the European Union, and other international organisations and are members of the BritishIrish Council. They are not part of the European Union (EU), although they are within the EU's customs area.  - The British Armed Forces form the military of the United Kingdom, tasked with defence of the country, its overseas territories, and the Crown dependencies. They also promote the UK's wider interests, support international peacekeeping efforts, and provide humanitarian aid.  - The English Army existed while England was an independent state and was at war with other states, but it was not until the Interregnum and the New Model Army (raised by Parliament to defeat the Royalists in the English Civil War) that England acquired a peacetime professional standing army. At the restoration of the monarchy, Charles II kept a small standing army, formed from elements of the Royalist army in exile and elements of the New Model Army, from which the most senior regular regiments of today's British Army can trace their antecedence. Likewise, Royal Marines can trace their origins back to the formation of the English Army's \\"Duke of York and Albany's maritime regiment of Foot\\" at the grounds of the Honourable Artillery Company on 28 October 1664.  - Postal interception is the act of retrieving another person's mail for the purpose of ensuring that the mail is not delivered to the recipient, or to spy on them.  - The military, also called the armed forces, are forces authorized to use deadly force, and weapons, to support the interests of the state and some or all of its citizens. The task of the military is usually defined as defense of the state and its citizens, and the prosecution of war against another state. The military may also have additional sanctioned and non-sanctioned functions within a society, including, the promotion of a political agenda, protecting corporate economic interests, internal population control, construction, emergency services, social ceremonies, and guarding important areas. The military can also function as a discrete subculture within a larger civil society, through the development of separate infrastructures, which may include housing, schools, utilities, food production and banking.  - The Internet is the global system of interconnected computer networks that use the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to link devices worldwide. It is a \\"network of networks\\" that consists of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. The Internet carries an extensive range of information resources and services, such as the inter-linked hypertext documents and applications of the World Wide Web (WWW), electronic mail, telephony, and peer-to-peer networks for file sharing.  - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union.  - Light infantry (or skirmishers) are soldiers whose job was to provide a skirmishing screen ahead of the main body of infantry, harassing and delaying the enemy advance. Light infantry was distinct from medium, heavy or line infantry. Heavy infantry were dedicated primarily to fighting in tight formations that were the core of large battles. Light infantry fought in open-order, often in close co-ordination with heavy infantry, where they could screen the heavy infantry from harassing fire, and the heavy infantry could intervene to protect the light infantry from attacks of enemy heavy infantry or cavalry. Heavy infantry originally had heavier arms and more armour than light infantry, but this distinction was lost as the use of armour declined and gunpowder weapons became standardized.  - Humanitarian aid is material and logistic assistance to people in need. It is usually short-term help until the long-term help by government and other institutions replaces it. Among the people in need belong homeless, refugees, victims of natural disasters, wars and famines. The primary purpose of humanitarian aid is to save lives, reduce suffering and respect to human dignity. Humanitarian aid is material or logistical assistance provided for humanitarian purposes, typically in response to humanitarian crises including natural disasters and man-made disaster. The primary objective of humanitarian aid is to save lives, alleviate suffering, and maintain human dignity. It may therefore be distinguished from development aid, which seeks to address the underlying socioeconomic factors which may have led to a crisis or emergency.  - Peacekeeping refers to activities intended to create conditions that favor lasting peace. Research generally finds that peacekeeping reduces civilian and battlefield deaths and reduces the risk of renewed warfare.  - Surveillance (or ) is the monitoring of the behavior, activities, or other changing information, usually of people for the purpose of influencing, managing, directing, or protecting them. This can include observation from a distance by means of electronic equipment (such as CCTV cameras), or interception of electronically transmitted information (such as Internet traffic or phone calls); and it can include simple, no- or relatively low-technology methods such as human intelligence agents and postal interception. The word \\"\\" comes from a French phrase for \\"watching over\\" (\\"sur\\" means \\"from above\\" and \\"veiller\\" means \\"to watch\\"), and is in contrast to more recent developments such as sousveillance.  - The Royal Navy (RN) is the United Kingdom's naval warfare force. Although warships were used by the English kings from the early medieval period, the first major maritime engagements were fought in the Hundred Years War against the kingdom of France. The modern Royal Navy traces its origins to the early 16th century; the oldest of the UK's armed services, it is known as the Senior Service.  - A troop is a military sub-subunit, originally a small formation of cavalry, subordinate to a squadron. In many armies a troop is the equivalent element to the infantry section or platoon. Exceptions are the Royal Horse Artillery and the US Cavalry, where troops are subunits that compare to an infantry company or artillery battery.   - Internet traffic is the flow of data across the Internet.

The senior U.S. diplomat who shepherded a series of secret U.S. meetings with the insurgents last year will meet with him late next week to ensure he’s on board, officials said. (Musadeq Sadeq/AP)      The Obama administration will resume peace talks with the Taliban as soon as Afghan President Hamid Karzai formally blesses the negotiations, according to senior administration officials who indicated that the process could be underway within weeks.      Marc Grossman, the senior U.S. diplomat who shepherded a series of secret U.S. meetings with the insurgents last year, will meet with Karzai late next week to ensure that he is on board, officials said.      “If Karzai were to tell [the Obama administration] to go ahead, then we’d start talking again,” said one of two officials who discussed the secret negotiations on the condition of anonymity.      A tentative U.S.-Taliban deal, including the transfer of five Afghan detainees from the Guantanamo Bay prison to Qatar and an insurgent renunciation of international terrorism, collapsed in December when Karzai refused to go along with it.      There have been no meetings with the insurgents since then. Although all parties have publicly said that they agree to one element of the deal — the opening of a Taliban office in Qatar — “we need now to make it real,” one official said.      Prime Minister Hamad bin Jasim al-Thani, for the first time acknowledging Qatar’s support for the arrangement, said Wednesday that his government welcomed “any opportunity” to defuse tension in the region. Thani spoke after a meeting with Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton.      The administration, which has said that negotiations must be “Afghan-led,” insists that its talks with the Taliban are only a preliminary effort to build confidence before actual negotiations over Afghanistan’s future can begin between the insurgents and the Karzai government.      One hurdle is that the Taliban prefers to talk to the United States and is “not willing to sit down with the Afghan government’,” one official said. “Our job is to see if we can break through that door.” Karzai has been under pressure from domestic opponents of negotiations to stand firm against the talks.      The officials provided an overview of how the talks have proceeded and where they go now.      Officials remain far from certain that the Taliban leadership is seriously interested in a political settlement. “There is an increasing number of Taliban who are tired of having the hell beat out of them,” one said. “I think they want to stop.” But, at the same time, “I imagine there are going to be splits,” the official said. “Some are going to want to talk, some are going to want to fight.”      Late last year, the U.S. intelligence community assessed that both military and diplomatic success were unlikely before December 2014, the date that President Obama and NATO allies have set for withdrawal of all combat troops from Afghanistan.      Marine Gen. John Allen, the top coalition commander in Afghanistan, was said to be so angered by the recent National Intelligence Estimate that he wrote a blistering formal dissent.      The officials said combat against the insurgents would continue and described what they called a “holistic” approach in which diplomatic progress was not possible without gains on the civilian and military fronts.      Although ground commanders have been skeptical of negotiations, a senior military official said that all wars “end in a political process” and that “this one is no exception.” He described progress thus far as “getting the car out of the garage” in preparation for “a difficult journey ahead.”      An official said meetings with Mohammed Tayeb al-Agha, an aide to Taliban leader Mohammad Omar, began in November 2010. To convince themselves that Agha had authority from the top Taliban leadership, “we tried to develop questions,” the official said, “tests, if you will, to see if he could receive a question, seek an answer from people senior to him and then stick with it.”      Agha, the official said, has been “shown on a number of occasions to accurately reflect the leaders” of the organization. “He is very consistent in what he seeks and how he seeks it.” The last meeting, in Qatar, was in October.      Throughout the process, the administration briefed Karzai and congressional leaders, officials said, particularly as they neared tentative agreement on confidence-building measures.      Among those measures, the United States asked for a public Taliban renunciation of international terrorism — in essence, a repudiation of al-Qaeda — and a separate statement of support for democracy in Afghanistan.      The Taliban wanted an office outside Afghanistan where they could operate beyond the supervision of their hosts in Pakistan, the officials said. The Americans said they considered the neutral location a place where the insurgents could begin talking to the Afghan government.      The insurgents also presented a list of five Guantanamo detainees, all of whom held positions in the Taliban government in Afghanistan between 1996 and 2001. Human rights organizations have said that several of them were responsible for severe abuses, although U.S. officials said they have ascertained that the militants were not involved in killing Americans.      The five were to be transferred to house arrest in Qatar, a move that would require Secretary of Defense Leon E. Panetta to certify to Congress that they would not be released and would not pose a threat to the United States. Qatar also would agree not to transfer them onward to another location, including Afghanistan.      The final conversations, before Karzai squelched the deal, were over “sequencing,” one of the officials said. “Who goes first? What do they say?” ||||| KABUL/WASHINGTON A video showing what appears to be American forces urinating on dead Taliban fighters prompted anger in Afghanistan and promises of a U.S. investigation on Thursday but the insurgent group said it would not harm nascent efforts to broker peace talks.      The video, posted on YouTube and other websites, shows four men in camouflage Marine combat uniforms urinating on three corpses. One of them jokes: \\"Have a nice day, buddy.\\" Another makes a lewd joke.      Afghan President Hamid Karzai condemned the video, describing the men's actions as \\"inhuman\\" and calling for an investigation, in a statement on Thursday evening.      In Washington U.S. Defense Secretary Leon Panetta telephoned Karzai to denounce the actions in the video as \\"deplorable\\" and to say it would be investigated immediately, the Pentagon said. General Martin Dempsey, the top U.S. military officer, said actions depicted in the video were illegal.      Although the U.S. military has stopped short of confirming the video is authentic, the Pentagon on Thursday came close. Pentagon spokesman Captain John Kirby said, \\"We don't have any indication that it's not authentic.\\"      The video is likely to stir up already strong anti-U.S. sentiment in Afghanistan after a decade of a war that has seen other cases of abuse, and that could complicate efforts to promote reconciliation as foreign troops gradually withdraw.      \\"Such action will leave a very, very bad impact on peace efforts,\\" Arsala Rahmani, a senior member of the Afghan government's High Peace Council, told Reuters.      The administration of U.S. President Barack Obama, seeing a glimmer of hope after months of efforts to broker talks, is launching a fresh round of shuttle diplomacy this weekend.      Marc Grossman, Obama's special representative for Afghanistan and Pakistan, will fly into the region for talks with Karzai and top officials in Turkey, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.      One immediate goal is to seal agreement for the Taliban to open a political office in the Gulf state of Qatar.      Despite concerns when the video first emerged that it would not help his efforts to build confidence among the warring parties, a Taliban spokesman said although the images were shocking, the tape would not affect talks or a mooted prisoner release.      \\"We know that our country is occupied ... . This is not a political process, so the video will not harm our talks and prisoner exchange because they are at the preliminary stage.\\"      CONCERN FOR MORE PROTESTS      Panetta called the actions shown in the film \\"utterly deplorable\\" and said he had ordered the Marine Corps and the commander of the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan to investigate.      \\"Those found to have engaged in such conduct will be held accountable to the fullest extent,\\" he said in a statement.      General James Amos, the commandant of the Marine Corps, said in a statement the video \\"apparently depicts Marines desecrating several dead Taliban in Afghanistan.\\"      He said he had asked the Naval Criminal Investigative Service to investigate and had set up another internal inquiry headed by Marine officers.      A Marine officer, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Reuters that the Marines in question were believed to be from the 3rd Battallion, 2nd Marines, which is based in Camp Lejeune, North Carolina.      White House spokesman Jay Carney said he was not aware of whether President Barack Obama had seen the video or not.      News of the footage had yet to spread in Afghanistan - a country where a minority have access to electricity and the Internet is limited to a tiny urban elite - but Afghans who were told about what the tape appears to show were horrified.      \\"It may start with just video footage, but it will end with demonstrations around the country and maybe the world,\\" said 44-year-old Qaisullah, who has a shop near the Kabul's Shah-e-dushamshera mosque.      Anti-American feeling has boiled over, or been whipped up, into violence several times in Afghanistan in recent years. Protests over reports of the desecration of the Muslim holy book have twice sparked deadly riots.      The tape also sparked anger across the Middle East and in Internet chatrooms, prompting reference to earlier scandals involving U.S. soldiers' treatment of prisoners in Iraq and the killing of unarmed civilians in Afghanistan.      \\"This is the embodiment of the strong assaulting the weak. It's nothing new for the Americans, it only adds to what they have done in Abu Ghraib prison. This a breach of the sacredness of Islam and Muslims,\\" said Othman al-Busaifi, 45, in Tripoli.      The U.S. military has been prosecuting soldiers from the Army's 5th Stryker Brigade on charges of murdering unarmed Afghan civilians while deployed in Kandahar province in 2010, and cutting off body parts as war trophies.      \\"They cut off ears and fingers and keep them as medals, and urinate on bodies, then they talk about civilization,\\" wrote user Abu Abdullah al-Janubi on one forum.      CRITICAL TIME      The video was released at a critical time for what U.S. officials hope might become authentic talks on Afghanistan's political future.      In Kabul Grossman will seek approval from Karzai - whose support for a U.S. effort he fears will sideline his government has wavered - to move ahead with good-faith measures seen as an essential precursor to negotiations that could give the Taliban a shared role in governing Afghanistan.      The diplomatic initiative includes a possible transfer of Taliban prisoners from the U.S. military detention camp at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.      A breakthrough would mark a milestone for the Obama administration, struggling to secure a modicum of stability in Afghanistan as it presses ahead with its gradual withdrawal from a long and costly war. The United States and its allies aim to withdraw combat troops by the end of 2014.

Question: You can use a stick to swat at what growing in a field?  Choices:  - woods - forest - bicycle spokes - home - grass  The rationale to choose \\"grass\\" as the answer is that: The answer to this question is:","output":"\\"grass\\" The rationale behind choosing \\"grass\\" as the answer to the question \\"You can use a stick to swat at what growing in a field?\\" lies in a careful examination of each of the provided choices and their relevance to the given scenario. Here, we will analyze each option and explain why \\"grass\\" has been determined to be the most appropriate answer. - Woods: Woods, as a collective term, refers to a densely wooded area of land with various types of trees. While it is possible for woods to grow near or adjacent to a field, using a stick to swat at them would not be practical. Trees are much larger and sturdier than a simple stick, making it impossible to swat them in any meaningful way. - Forest: A forest refers to a vast expanse of land covered by trees, which can be dense or sparse. Similar to a wooded area, forests can be located near fields, but using a stick to swat at the trees will have little to no effect. The sheer size and strength of trees make this option unfeasible and irrelevant to the given scenario. - Bicycle spokes: Bicycle spokes are the metal rods that connect the wheel's rim to its central hub. While they may be present in a field, using a stick to swat them is not related to something growing in the field. Spokes are part of a man-made object and are not a natural growth that could be found in a field. - Home: A home, which is typically a structure built and inhabited by people, cannot grow in a field. While it is true that houses can be built near or in the middle of a field, they don't physically grow from the ground, making this option irrelevant to the context of the question. - Grass: Finally, grass is a type of vegetation that is common in fields, meadows, and other open areas. Given its relatively low height and flexible structure, it can be swatted easily with a stick. Grass grows abundantly in fields due to the abundance of sunlight and fertile soil found in these areas. In comparison to the other choices provided, grass is the only option that is both a naturally growing element in a field and can be feasibly swatted using a stick. In conclusion, the rationale for choosing \\"grass\\" as the answer to the question \\"You can use a stick to swat at what growing in a field?\\" lies in its practicality and relevance to the given context. Grass is a naturally occurring, common vegetation that grows consistently in open fields. Unlike the other options presented, it can be effectively swatted with a simple stick, making it the most fitting answer."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

This situation might arise due to several reasons, as outlined below: 1. Shopping Bag Material: The material of the shopping bag could be inelastic or have low stretchability, preventing it from accommodating the size of the egg carton. For instance, if the bag were made of materials such as recycled paper or non-woven fabric, it might not be as flexible as a plastic or cotton bag. 2. Bag Dimensions: The dimensions of the bag could be insufficient to hold the egg carton. As an example, if the bag were designed to carry smaller items, such as snacks or canned goods, it might not have the necessary width, length, or depth to house an egg carton. 3. Egg Carton Size: The egg carton itself could be larger than an average carton, containing a higher quantity of eggs or designed with added protection for the eggs. This increased size could render it incompatible with the shopping bag's dimensions. 4. Other Items in the Bag: It's also possible that the shopping bag already contained several items, limiting the available space for the egg carton. If this were the case, the egg carton would not fit, regardless of its size or the bag's dimensions. In the given scenario, option (B) \\"Egg carton was too small.\\" would not be a valid choice because it would not prevent the egg carton from fitting into the shopping bag.

Around 1528, a group of Spaniard explorers, led by Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca, first entered the actual territory of what is now Chihuahua. The conquest of the territory lasted nearly one century, and encountered fierce resistance from the Conchos tribe, but the desire of the Spanish Crown to transform the region into a bustling mining center led to a strong strategy to control the area. Which tribe resisted fiercely this conquest?","output":"The tribe that fiercely resisted the conquest of Nueva Vizcaya (New Biscay) in northern New Spain by the Spanish during the 16th and 17th centuries was the Conchos tribe. The Conchos were an indigenous people residing in the region that is now present-day Chihuahua, Mexico. They were known for their strong resistance against the Spanish colonization and their efforts to protect their lands, culture, and way of life. Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca and his group of explorers were the first to encounter the Conchos tribe as they ventured into the Nueva Vizcaya territory in the early 16th century. Their interactions with the tribe were not always peaceful, as the Conchos made it clear that they did not want to submit to Spanish authority. This resistance led to a series of conflicts that would last for almost a century. The Spanish Crown was determined to establish control over the region, driven by the potential for vast mineral wealth and the desire to expand their empire. To achieve this, the Spaniards employed a combination of military force, diplomacy, and strategic alliances with other indigenous groups in the region. Throughout the various battles and skirmishes against the Conchos tribe, the Spanish were able to gain some control over the Nueva Vizcaya province. However, the resistance put up by the Conchos made the conquest a difficult and long-drawn process. As a result of this prolonged struggle, the Spanish Crown had to reconsider their approach and began focusing on developing the mining industry in the region. The establishment of mining settlements allowed the Spaniards to exert greater control over the area and exploit the abundant natural resources. Ultimately, the Spanish were successful in subjugating the Conchos tribe, leading to the decline of their population and the eventual assimilation of the remaining members into Spanish society. The Spanish conquest of Nueva Vizcaya marked a significant step in the colonization of Northern Mexico and the expansion of the Spanish Empire in the New World. Nevertheless, the fierce resistance put up by the Conchos tribe serves as a testament to the determination and resilience of indigenous peoples in the face of colonial expansion."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. What society did the man who had poor command of the Czech language become chorus master of after returning from Sweden?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  In 1861, it was announced that a Provisional Theatre would be built in Prague, as a home for Czech opera. Smetana saw this as an opportunity to write and stage opera that would reflect Czech national character, similar to the portrayals of Russian life in Mikhail Glinka's operas. He hoped that he might be considered for the theatre's conductorship, but the post went to Jan Nepomuk Maýr, apparently because the conservative faction in charge of the project considered Smetana a \\"dangerous modernist\\", in thrall to avant garde composers such as Liszt and Wagner. Smetana then turned his attention to an opera competition, organised by Count Jan von Harrach, which offered prizes of 600 gulden each for the best comic and historical operas based on Czech culture. With no useful model on which to base his work—Czech opera as a genre scarcely existed—Smetana had to create his own style. He engaged Karel Sabina, his comrade from the 1848 barricades, as his librettist, and received Sabina's text in February 1862, a story of the 13th century invasion of Bohemia by Otto of Brandenburg. In April 1863 he submitted the score, under the title of The Brandenburgers in Bohemia. At this stage in his career, Smetana's command of the Czech language was poor. His generation of Czechs was educated in German, and he had difficulty expressing himself in what was supposedly his native tongue. To overcome these linguistic deficiencies he studied Czech grammar, and made a point of writing and speaking in Czech every day. He had become Chorus Master of the nationalistic Hlahol Choral Society soon after his return from Sweden, and as his fluency in the Czech language developed he composed patriotic choruses for the Society; The Three Riders and The Renegade were performed at concerts in early 1863. In March of that year Smetana was elected president of the music section of Umělecká Beseda, a society for Czech artists. By 1864 he was proficient enough in the Czech language to be appointed as music critic to the main Czech language newspaper...

The review is concise, but positive. \\"Simple\\" could be viewed as slightly neutral or positive depending on context - some might see 'simplicity' as a lack of complexity or features, but others see it as a beneficial attribute for understanding and usability. \\"Effective\\" is clearly positive, showing that the product or service achieves what it was intended to. While the review is positive, it lacks detailed commentary. Important details like functionality, value for money, user-friendliness, and customer service, which are often cited in more comprehensive reviews, are absent.  Given its brevity along with the positivity, I would rate this review as a 4 on the scale.  The reason I didn't rate it a 5 is because although it's positive, it lacks depth and detail that could be more helpful in determining the overall satisfaction of the user. Adding more detail would have increased the rating to a 5. Also, since the scale is relative to other reviews (assuming more detailed positive reviews will be rated as 5), this review can't achieve the highest rating.

Is \\"The heavy infantry of the maniples were supported by a number of light infantry and cavalry troops, typically 300 horsemen per manipular legion.\\" the correct answer? Available choices: * yes * no","output":"No, the statement \\"The heavy infantry of the maniples were supported by a number of light infantry and cavalry troops, typically 300 horsemen per manipular legion\\" slightly oversimplifies the organization and composition of the Roman manipular legion. A Roman legion, particularly during the manipular era, was composed of several types of infantry and cavalry units. A single manipular legion typically consisted of three distinct lines of infantry: hastati, principes, and triarii. These infantry units, organized into maniples, were supported by light infantry (velites) and cavalry (equites), as well as various specialized troops. The actual number of horsemen in a single manipular legion, however, depended on the specific historical period and the overall size of the legion, which could vary due to factors like available resources, military campaigns, and the perceived need for specific types of troops. During the early and mid-Republican period (roughly 6th-3rd centuries BCE), a Roman legion might have included around 300 horsemen, divided into 10 squadrons, called turmae. Each turma was led by a decurion, and the cavalry as a whole was commanded by the senior officer or tribune. However, this is not a universal number for all manipular legions. The Second Punic War (218-201 BCE) saw the Roman army undergo several organizational changes and adjustments in response to military setbacks and Hannibal's innovative tactics. The need for increased mobility and flexibility on the battlefield led to augmenting the cavalry in the Roman legions. In some instances, the number of horsemen might have doubled in a single legion.  By the time of Julius Caesar and Augustus, Rome had transitioned from the manipular system to the cohort system, which dictated the organization of the legions. While the basic unit of the cohort system was the cohort rather than the maniple and involved the integration of heavy infantry instead of being divided into distinct lines, cavalry continued to play an essential role in Roman warfare. In the late Republic (1st century BCE) and early Empire (1st century CE), a legion typically consisted of around 5,000-6,000 infantrymen, with approximately 120 horsemen, organized into four squadrons. Thus, the primary focus shifted to heavy infantry, and the cavalry was more likely to be provided by allied forces, making the auxiliary cavalry units (such as the numerus) an increasingly important aspect of Rome's military forces. In conclusion, while it is not incorrect to say that \\"The heavy infantry of the maniples were supported by a number of light infantry and cavalry troops,\\" the number of horsemen in a single manipular legion could vary depending on the specific historical context and operational needs. Instead of specifying an exact figure, it is more accurate to emphasize the essential role played by horsemen in the overall composition and tactical flexibility of the Roman manipular legion."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Walking up it is quite a bit easier than running or cycling up it , I assure you . Ha ! Answer the following question: Why is it easier to walk up the Big Dam Bridge ?","output":"Walking up the Big Dam Bridge is considered easier than running or cycling up for several reasons. Here's a detailed explanation of the factors contributing to the relative ease of walking as opposed to other modes of traversing the bridge. 1. Muscle Engagement: While walking, your leg muscles are engaged at a more gradual pace, allowing for less fatigue in comparison to cycling or running. Running and cycling require more powerful and continuous contractions from the muscles, which results in quicker exhaustion. 2. Energy Expenditure: Walking consumes less energy per unit of distance than running or cycling, allowing you to conserve more energy as you ascend the bridge. When you run or cycle, more muscle groups are involved, thereby demanding more energy and increasing the chances that you'll tire. 3. Traction and Balance: Walking provides better control over traction and balance. During the ascent, your feet have more time to properly grip the ground, preventing slips, and ensuring better stability. On the other hand, cycling uphill requires a precise balance between maintaining control and applying enough force to keep advancing, while running increases the chances of slips or stumbles. 4. Oxygen Consumption: As walking is a low-intensity activity, it results in slower heart rates, allowing your body to efficiently consume and distribute oxygen. For cycling and running, the intensity level and heart rate are higher, making it more challenging to supply sufficient oxygen to the muscles, ultimately leading to shortness of breath or discomfort during the ascent. 5. Lactic Acid Buildup: Due to lower aerobic intensity, walking reduces the rate at which lactic acid accumulates in the muscles. When running or cycling uphill, lactic acid - a byproduct of anaerobic respiration - increases, causing muscle soreness and fatigue. Walking allows the body more time to metabolize and clear out lactic acid, reducing the risks of muscle cramps or discomfort. 6. Recovery Time: As walking is a low-impact activity, it leads to quicker recovery times for muscles and joints compared to running or cycling. This means that muscles can recuperate faster after you've ascended the bridge, allowing you to recover and continue your journey with less strain. 7. Reduced Injury Risk: Walking reduces the risk of injury. Running and cycling, especially on an uphill climb like the Big Dam Bridge, can put increased stress on joints and muscles, leading to a higher chance of sprains, strains, or other injuries. In summary, walking up the Big Dam Bridge is easier than running or cycling due to its low impact on joints and muscles, reduced energy expenditure, better balance and traction, efficient oxygen consumption, lower lactic acid buildup, shorter recovery times, and lower injury risks. These factors combine to make walking a more comfortable and enjoyable way to experience the Big Dam Bridge."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Shoe creams polish and add color to leather, so make sure you choose a color you don’t mind wearing. Try to select a cream that matches the color of your shoes. Creams work very well on repaired cracks, but you can also use them to color the rest of the leather. Use a cotton or microfiber cloth to restore the leather back to its normal state. Starting at the top of each shoe, rub the leather with small, circular motions. Buff both shoes equally to get them to look the same. Make sure you treat all parts of the shoe the same way so the leather looks uniform all over. Check the shoes again to see how they look. With proper treatment, the cracks will no longer be visible. Use more filler, cream, or other products as needed. A great time to start conditioning is after you finish with the repairs. Use a clean cotton or microfiber cloth to avoid working dirt into the leather. Apply the conditioner in a thin, even layer by buffing the leather with small, circular motions. Work on one part of the shoe at a time until you have it completely covered. As an animal material, leather needs regular oiling to prevent it from drying out and cracking. Regular conditioning also masks old cracks and prevents them from reappearing.","output":"To polish and repair cracked leather shoes, apply a matching color cream over the filler using a shoe dauber or cotton cloth in circular motions.

Q:Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the name of the band that did not foresee \\"Under the Bridge\\" as being equally viable due to the success of \\"Give it Away\\"?  Blood Sugar Sex Magik was released on September 24, 1991, the same day as Nirvana's breakthrough album Nevermind. It was certified gold just over two months later on November 26, 1991, and certified platinum on April 1, 1992; since then it has gone seven times platinum in the United States. The album peaked at number 3 on the Billboard 200. Originally, \\"Give it Away\\" did not fare well in the mainstream; several of Warner Bros.' target radio stations refused to air it, telling the band to \\"come back to us when you have a melody in your song\\". KROQ (of Los Angeles), however, began to play the single several times daily, and that, according to Kiedis, \\"was the beginning of the infusion of 'Give It Away' into mass consciousness.\\" The single ultimately peaked at number 9 on the UK Top 40 and number 73 on the Billboard Hot 100. Blood Sugar Sex Magik has sold over 13 million copies worldwide.Due to the success of \\"Give it Away\\", the band did not foresee \\"Under the Bridge\\" as being equally viable. Warner Bros. sent representatives to a Chili Peppers' concert in order to figure out what would ultimately be the next single. When Frusciante began playing \\"Under the Bridge\\", Kiedis missed his cue; the entire audience began singing the song, instead.

People spend maybe an hour or so to wandering around the town square, and buy a drink before hopping back on their transport back to the capital city of Romania. But, thanks to an epic tip-off from the travel ninja Shikha at Why Waste Annual Leave and a few other Brasov devotees, instead of following the crowds, we booked a couple of leisurely nights there. At the end of our day trip, instead of returning to Bucharest and getting stuck in the Sunday evening traffic, we checked into our hotel and waved our guide off.  Yes, you can easily ‘do’ Brasov in an afternoon – it’s a popular stop off at the end of a day trip after visiting the “home” of Dracula – Bran castle, and the beautiful Peles castle – but having the leisure to linger was exquisite. In addition to trying local dishes, we also ate lunch at McDonalds. Yes, yes, as a blogger we shouldn’t pretend to eat anything other than caviar washed down with champagne and unicorn tears, but we were hungry and couldn’t be bothered to find somewhere. (For the record, we both opted for a Big Mac and a diet coke.)

Although the city is not yet heavily damaged, the mushroom cloud from Finningley is clearly visible and chaos reigns in the streets, with Jimmy last seen running from his stalled truck in an attempt to reach Ruth. Sheffield is soon hit by a one megaton warhead launched at the Tinsley Viaduct.

The reason for this negative sentiment can be broken down into several key points: 1. Unfavorable comparison: The reviewer explicitly states their preference for Milepost, which they used extensively in Alaska. The implication here is that they were expecting a similar level of detail and quality from the Explore! guide for Montana. By expressing dissatisfaction in finding that Explore! does not come close to Milepost's level of detail, the reviewer is essentially implying that the product did not meet their expectations or needs. 2. Explicit disappointment: The reviewer voices their disappointment by stating that if Milepost were available for every state, that's what they would choose. This indicates that the reviewer would have preferred to use Milepost over Explore! had the option been available. 3. Future intentions: The reviewer concludes their review by expressing their intention to find an alternative to Explore! for their next trip out west. They do not mention any positive attributes of Explore! nor do they show any intent to recommend it to others. This further demonstrates that the reviewer's experience with the product was negative, and they would avoid using it again in the future.

This ensures that the process is completed safely and efficiently.

Write a summary based on this article: Shkreli then lied, and lied, and lied some more to hide his ongoing losses of investors' money from bad trades, including a failed short trade that left one of his funds 7 million in the red, and then continued lying as he used money and stock looted from his drug company Retrophin to repay them, Srinivasan said.      \\"All told the defendant stole more than 10 million from Retrophin and its shareholders,\\" Srinivasan said of Shkreli, who is charged with eight criminal counts of conspiracy to commit securities and wire fraud, as well as securities fraud.      But Brafman portrayed Shkreli as a self-educated scientific boy wonder who slept nights in a sleeping bag in his office as he worked to develop a cure for a deadly disease afflicting children, while at the same time making millions of dollars for his investors.      Brafman said that contrary to the government's suggestions, the investors in the MSMB funds not only got their original investment amount back, but often much more.      The attorney also depicted Shkreli as an \\"odd duck\\" prone to wearing furry bunny slippers and a stethoscope around the corporate offices while serving as CEO of Retrophin.      Brafman said Shkreli was bullied and called names behind his back by co-workers as well as Retrophin board members who eventually ousted him because he didn't look or act like a conventional CEO.      Shkreli's colleagues made fun of him among themselves, calling him \\"Rain Man\\" because they believed he was autistic, and challenging his sexuality by suggesting he was gay or bisexual, Brafman said.      \\"As Lady Gaga said, he was born this way,\\" Brafman said, referring to Shkreli's often awkward nature. \\"You wanna call him names? Call him names. Just don't call him guilty. 'Cause he's not guilty.\\"      Shkreli, sitting at the defense table, sometimes nodded in agreement with Brafman's broad defense of him and with the lawyer's attack on expected witnesses against him.      The lawyer said that all of the people who placed their money with Shkreli's funds were sophisticated investors, or had top-notch financial advisors, and were \\"high rollers\\" who wanted to exploit Shkreli's genius to make big returns.      Brafman also said that the many consulting agreements and settlement deals that Shkreli cut, which the government claims were used to cover up his looting of Retrophin, were signed off by the corporation's board and lawyers.      Brafman suggested that Retrophin board members and its current CEO would lie when they took the witness stand against Shkreli, and told jurors that they would be able to discern those lies from how the witnesses answered questions and were contradicted by documents, emails and other evidence.      The question at the end of the trial, Brafman told jurors, will be \\"not whether Martin Shkreli is nuts, but whether the case is nuts.\\" ||||| After Mr. Shkreli lost millions of dollars in a trade, draining the remaining money from MSMB Capital, a few days later he founded MSMB Healthcare, in early 2011, the prosecutor said. About the same time, he formed the pharmaceutical company Retrophin, and had MSMB Healthcare invest in Retrophin. “The defendant was on both sides of the deal,” Mr. Srinivasan said.      When his debt for the trading loss came due, “he stole money from MSMB Healthcare” to pay the debt, which the health care fund did not owe, Mr. Srinivasan said. Mr. Shkreli then told investors that he was shutting down the two funds, and told them they could have stock in Retrophin or cash for their shares.      Those who wanted cash could not get it and threatened to sue, he said, and that is when Mr. Shkreli arranged for Retrophin to “pay off” the MSMB investors.      “Retrophin owed these investors nothing — the defendant owed these debts,” Mr. Srinivasan said. When accountants told him to stop, Mr. Shkreli arranged to hire the investors as consultants, a sham, the prosecutor said.      Investors may have made their money back, Mr. Srinivasan said, but Mr. Shkreli still committed fraud.      In his opening, Mr. Brafman flipped the setup that Mr. Srinivasan had constructed in trying to portray the investors and Retrophin board as victims and Mr. Shkreli as a villain.      Actually, Mr. Brafman said, Mr. Shkreli was pushed out of Retrophin because its board thought he did “not conform to their idea of what a public company C.E.O. should look like or walk like or talk like,” he said. ||||| At start of securities fraud trial, US prosecutor accuses ex-pharmaceutical CEO of building a bogus hedge fund empire by telling ‘lies on top of lies on top of lies’      Martin Shkreli is either a con man who scammed hedge fund investors out of millions or a nerdy genius who made them even richer.            The conflicting portraits were offered Wednesday in opening statements at Shkreli’s securities fraud trial, a case colored by the ex-pharmaceutical CEO’s antics on social media which, despite the urging of his lawyers to lay low, have never subsided.      Potential Martin Shkreli jurors: we can't be impartial over 'most hated man' in US Read more      “Is he strange? Yes,” the defense attorney Benjamin Brafman told the jurors in federal court in Brooklyn. “Will you find him weird? Yes. But Martin Shkreli, despite all his flaws and dysfunctional personality, is brilliant beyond words.”      In his opening, the assistant US attorney Karthik Srinivasan accused Shkreli of building a bogus hedge fund empire by telling “lies on top of lies on top of lies”. Though he portrayed himself as a Wall Street wizard, “in reality, he was just a con man”, the prosecutor said.      Shkreli, sometimes dubbed Pharma Bro, often slumped in his chair and looked bored during jury selection but listened intently and took notes during the government’s opening. As his lawyer spoke, he beamed at times.      Shkreli, 34, became a pariah in 2015 after a drug company he founded, Turing Pharmaceuticals, spent 55m for the US rights to sell a life-saving medicine called Daraprim and promptly raised the price from 13.50 to 750 per pill.      The spotlight intensified later that year with his arrest on charges – unrelated to Daraprim – focusing on a pair of failed hedge funds he founded. After he lost investors’ money through bad trades, he secretly looted Retrophin, another pharmaceutical company where he was CEO, for 10m to pay back his disgruntled clients, Srinivasan said.      “Rather than owning up to his lies and admitting his investments were a failure, the defendant doubled down by engaging in an even bigger fraud,” he said.      The alleged victims in the case were high-rolling investors who were drawn to Shkreli’s quirky personality and ended up getting their money back – and more – because Retrophin eventually became a successful startup worth 1bn, Brafman said.      Board members of his companies who made fun of Shkreli behind his back – questioning his sexuality, wondering if he was autistic and calling him Rain Man after the movie character – misunderstood his talents, said the defense lawyer, who referred to his client as a “nerd”, “odd duck” and a “mad scientist”.      He added: “As Lady Gaga said, ‘He was Born This Way.”      Jury selection, which started Monday, dragged out until late Wednesday afternoon as the judge sought to find jurors who could ignore the negative press over the price-gouging scandal. Also hard to ignore was Skhreli’s footprint on social media, where he boasted about buying a one-of-a-kind Wu-Tang Clan album for 2m and got kicked off Twitter for trolling a female freelance journalist in creepy ways.      Questioned by the judge during sidebars, prospective jurors described Shkreli as “the face of corporate greed” and “a snake”.      “In this particular case,” another dismissed juror said Wednesday, “the only thing I’d be impartial about is what prison he goes to.”      Shkreli is free on 5m bond. If convicted, he faces up to 20 years in prison. ||||| Summary:","output":"Martin Shkreli, the controversial former pharmaceutical CEO, is either a con man who scammed hedge fund investors or a nerdy genius, lawyers in his securities fraud trial argued in their opening statements. Shkreli, the ex-CEO of Turing Pharmaceuticals, gained notoriety in 2015 after a £55m deal gave his company the rights to antiparasitic drug Daraprim, after which the price soared from 13.50 to 750 per pill overnight.

Write an article based on this summary: A project to publish every letter ever written or received by Charles Darwin is expected to be completed after a £5m funding boost. Article:","output":"Title: Charles Darwin's Complete Correspondence Collection to See the Light of Day After £5m Funding Boost Introduction A monumental project to publish every letter ever written or received by Charles Darwin, the renowned naturalist and biologist, is expected to reach completion following a substantial funding infusion of £5 million. The enterprise, spear-headed by the Darwin Correspondence Project (DCP), intends to shed light on the life and work of the scientist, offering insight into his relationships, personal thoughts, and the manner in which his scientific theories developed and evolved over time. Background on Charles Darwin Charles Darwin, born in 1809, was an English naturalist, geologist, and biologist, notable for his work on the science of evolution. His most famous contribution, the theory of natural selection, argues that species evolve over generations through a process of heritable traits that enhance an organism's ability to survive and reproduce in its given environment. Darwin's groundbreaking book, \\"On the Origin of Species,\\" published in 1859, introduced this theory and has since become the cornerstone of evolutionary biology. The Darwin Correspondence Project (DCP) Established in 1974 at the University of Cambridge, the Darwin Correspondence Project aims to publish the entire collection of Darwin's letters, providing a unique window into the private world of the influential scientist. The project's mission is to make the letters accessible for scholarly and public use, enabling researchers and enthusiasts around the globe to gain an intimate perspective on Darwin's thought process, scientific inquiries, and exchanges with acquaintances. Over the span of nearly five decades, the project has managed to transcribe and annotate more than half of the 15,000 letters in their possession. However, with the recent £5 million funding boost provided by the Oldbury Trust, DCP is expected to realize its goal of publishing all of Darwin's letters in the next ten years. The Significance of the Letters Darwin's letters encompass an extensive range of topics, covering scientific treaties, personal thoughts, and communication with fellow scientists, friends, and family members. Among these correspondences are key exchanges with colleagues such as Thomas Henry Huxley, Joseph Dalton Hooker, and Alfred Russel Wallace, who were prominent figures in the scientific community at the time.  The letters provide an unparalleled opportunity to study Darwin's philosophies, argumentations, and evolving beliefs in a way that formal scientific publications cannot capture. They offer a narrative of scientific discovery and collaboration in the 19th century, illuminating the challenges and triumphs that Darwin experienced throughout his personal and professional life. Moreover, the letters serve as a treasure trove for historians, biologists, and the general public interested in understanding the formulation of the theory of natural selection and the development of evolutionary biology. As crucial artifacts documenting the history of science, these letters have the potential to foster a deeper appreciation for Darwin's contributions and their enduring significance in various domains of human knowledge and inquiry. Conclusion The Darwin Correspondence Project's efforts to publish Charles Darwin's complete collection of letters will profoundly enrich our grasp of the great scientist's contributions to our understanding of life on Earth. With the generous £5 million funding boost, devotees of Darwin's work can anticipate a comprehensive understanding of his life and mind in the near future. This achievement not only underscores the historical importance of his discoveries but also serves as a testament to the enduring impact of his theories and ideas in shaping our comprehension of the natural world."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. \\"point and purpose \\" How would the sentiment of this sentence be perceived?","output":"The sentiment of the sentence \\"point and purpose\\" can be perceived in multiple ways. Analyzing the words in isolation, \\"point\\" and \\"purpose\\" can come across as neutral or even slightly positive expressions. However, the sentiment behind the entire phrase ultimately depends on the context in which it is used, the tone of surrounding statements, and even the individual reader's perspective. Let's delve into a detailed and long exploration of the possible interpretations. 1. Neutral sentiment: In some contexts, the phrase \\"point and purpose\\" might be perceived as a neutral statement. It may be used to emphasize the importance of having a meaningful reason behind an action or decision, without necessarily expressing a positive or negative emotion. For instance, someone could say, \\"In every project, it is crucial to understand the point and purpose before proceeding.\\" Here, the sentiment neither leans positive nor negative but is simply a reminder or assertion. 2. Positive sentiment: At times, the phrase can carry a positive sentiment, especially when it is used to describe the meaningful, focused, or goal-oriented nature of something. For example, during a review of a book or movie, a critic may mention, \\"The narrative is well-constructed, with every scene having a clear point and purpose.\\" In this context, \\"point and purpose\\" becomes a positive quality, reflecting the strength of the work in having every aspect thought out and directed towards a common goal. 3. Negative sentiment: Conversely, the phrase can also be used to express dissatisfaction or confusion with a lack of an actionable direction. An example might be a person saying, \\"I walked out of that meeting with no idea of the point and purpose behind the discussion.\\" This statement would suggest that the speaker found the conversation pointless or directionless, leading to a negative view of the meeting. 4. Questioning sentiment: In some circumstances, this phrase is used to prompt further explanation or inquiry. In this case, the sentiment might be a bit critical or challenging, as it questions the rationale behind someone's choices or actions: \\"What is the point and purpose of spending so much money on this event?\\" Here, the respondent is demanding justification for a decision, inviting a response that could either satisfy their curiosity or draw further criticism. 5. Slightly sarcastic sentiment: Depending on tone and context, the phrase \\"point and purpose\\" might carry a sarcastic or ironic undertone. In a situation where the speaker feels the subject matter is nonsensical, irrelevant, or needlessly complicated, they may use the phrase to derisively highlight its futility. For example: \\"Sure, let's keep arguing about the font size – the real point and purpose of this project.\\" In summary, the sentiment behind the phrase \\"point and purpose\\" can be neutral, positive, negative, questioning, or sarcastic, based on the context in which it is employed, the tone and intent of the speaker, and how the listener interprets it. To accurately gauge its intended impact, one should consider the surrounding conversation, intended audience, and delivery tone."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Negative Yelp Review: Title: Disappointing Experience at [Restaurant Name] I'm usually not one to write negative reviews, but in this case, I feel compelled to share my experience at [Restaurant Name], as it severely fell short of my expectations. My family and I went to this restaurant last night, looking forward to a lovely dining experience but instead, we left with a sour taste in our mouths (figuratively and literally).  Upon arrival, it took a long time for the host to seat us, even though there were several empty tables available. When we were finally seated, we observed that the tables weren't very clean, with crumbs left over from the previous guests. This should have been an indication of what to expect, but we decided to give it a chance and stay. The interior of the restaurant was quite noisy, and the music was playing excessively loud, making it difficult to maintain a conversation. This severely undercut the ambiance and affected the enjoyment of our meal. Our server seemed overwhelmed and uninterested in providing us with attentive customer service. It took a while before someone came to take our order, and even then, the server didn't seem knowledgeable enough to offer recommendations or answer questions about the menu items. We had to call the server's attention multiple times to refill our water glasses and bring condiments, which made us feel neglected. The food itself left a lot to be desired. We ordered a variety of dishes, hoping to sample the best that [Restaurant Name] had to offer, but sadly, everything we tried lacked flavor and depth. The presentation was unimpressive, and some dishes appeared as if they had been hastily thrown together. My steak was overcooked and tough to chew, while the accompanying vegetables were under-seasoned and almost tasteless. My wife's pasta dish was drowning in sauce, yet somehow still dry. Our daughter's meal was equally disappointing, as her chicken was dry and her side dish seemed like it had been sitting under the heating lamp for too long. The final straw came when we received the bill. The prices were steep, and considering the poor quality of food, lack of ambiance, and subpar service, we felt it was not worth the cost. I really wanted to enjoy our visit to [Restaurant Name], but unfortunately, this experience has deterred us from returning. In conclusion, I cannot recommend dining at [Restaurant Name] due to the lack of cleanliness, poor customer service, unimpressive food quality, and high prices. We had hoped for a memorable evening out, but instead, we were left extremely disappointed and regretful of our decision to eat at this establishment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","output":"Title: Extremely Disappointing and Inefficient Application Review: I am extremely disappointed with my experience using the com.google.android.gms app, and I regret to say that I am compelled to give it a 1-star rating. The overall performance of this app has been consistently poor, and it has become more of a source of inconvenience rather than a helpful tool. To begin with, the app's installation process was unintuitive and filled with unnecessary steps. I was hopeful that, once installed, the app would be more user-friendly, but my optimism was short-lived. It is evident that the developers put little thought into an efficient user experience, as the app's interface is cluttered, disorganized, and hard to navigate. Frequent crashes and unresponsive features have only worsened my experience with the com.google.android.gms app. Oftentimes, a simple attempt to access a menu or an in-app setting would lead to an unresponsive screen, followed by a complete app crash. This level of instability has proven to be extremely frustrating and time-consuming, as I have had to relaunch the app multiple times just to complete a simple task. Additionally, the app proved to be a significant drain on my device's battery life and performance. Even when running in the background, it consumed a considerable amount of battery, causing my device's battery to deplete much faster than usual. Furthermore, the app's impact on my device's performance was highly noticeable, causing it to lag and freeze repeatedly. Lastly, I cannot overlook the lack of effective customer support for this app. When I encountered issues and sought assistance, I was greeted by unhelpful and unresponsive support channels. It was as if the developers had no interest in resolving issues for their users, which made me feel even more undervalued as a customer. In conclusion, I cannot recommend the com.google.android.gms app to anyone in its current state. The app's poor performance, instability, high battery consumption, and unresponsive customer support make it severely lacking in all aspects. Users would be better off seeking alternative solutions, as this app fails to deliver a competent and positive experience."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

As Harvey's interests shifted to the Pyramid, Monte Ne's resort days effectively ended and the number of visitors slowly dwindled. Activities and events at Monte Ne continued, supported by locals who still visited in large numbers. Harvey sold the Hotel Monte Ne. The hotel went through several name changes and owners, becoming the White Hotel circa 1912, the Randola Inn in 1918, the Hotel Frances in 1925, and in 1930 the Sleepy Valley Hotel. Monte Ne's larger hotels continued to be active after they, along with the dance pavilion and Elixir Spring, were foreclosed and sold at public auction. From 1927 to 1932, Missouri Row and Oklahoma Row (often called the Club House Hotels at this point) were home to the Ozark Industrial College and School of Theology, a nonsectarian school run by Dan W. Evans. The hotels housed pupils—Missouri Row for boys, Oklahoma Row for girls—and Oklahoma Row also provided classroom and dining spaces. Evans and his family lived in the tower. The dance pavilion was enclosed and served as the school chapel. In May 1932, following a mortgage foreclosure against the school, school officials were evicted and the property was sold.After he announced the building of the Pyramid, at age 69, Harvey began suffering a series of serious health problems, but continued to work tirelessly. In 1926, blood poisoning in his foot put him in a coma that lasted several days resulting in surgery, and three months of recuperation. In 1929 he and Anna were finally divorced. Three days later Harvey married his long-time personal secretary May Leake. In 1930, he came down with double pneumonia.

Question: Information:  - The Haplogynae are a clade of araneomorph spiders, one of the two main groups into which the araneomorphs are divided.  - The Prodidomidae are a spider family with about 300 species in 31 genera. They are sometimes called long-spinneret ground spiders.  - Mesothelae is a suborder of spiders (order Araneae) that includes a single living (extant) family, Liphistiidae, and a number of extinct families. This suborder is thought to form the sister group to all other living spiders, and retain ancestral characters, such as a segmented abdomen with spinnerets in the middle and two pairs of book lungs. Members of Liphistiidae are medium to large spiders with eight eyes grouped on a tubercle. They are only found in China, Japan, and southeast Asia.  - The Thomisidae are a family of spiders, including about 175 genera and over 2,100 species. The common name crab spider is often applied to species in this family, but is also applied loosely to many other species of spiders. Among the Thomisidae, \\"crab spider\\" refers most often to the familiar species of \\"flower crab spiders\\", though not all members of the family are limited to ambush hunting in flowers.  - The Entelegynae or entelegynes are a subgroup of araneomorph spiders, one of the two main groups into which the araneomorphs are divided. Almost all members of this group, unlike most members of Haplogynae (the other main group), have eight eyes, and females have a genital plate. However, some entelegyne species have no (or reduced) eyes, and six-eyed spiders do occur, for example in the genus \\"Lygromma\\" (Prodidomidae, Gnaphosoidea).  - The Mygalomorphae or mygalomorphs are an infraorder of spiders. The name is derived from the Greek \\"mugal\\", meaning \\"shrew\\", plus \\"morph\\" meaning form or shape. An older name for the group is Orthognatha, derived from the orientation of the fangs which point straight down and do not cross each other (as they do in the araneomorphs).  - The Dionycha are a phylogenetic group of spiders ( Araneomorphae : Entelegynae ) with about 10,000 species . 17 families belong to this group , amongst others : Salticidae ( jumping spiders ) , Gnaphosoidea , Thomisidae ( crab spiders ) , and the Clubionidae . Spiders in this group have better senses ( sight , hearing ) than others , some even show courtship dances and songs . The Dionycha probably evolved from the web - building Trionycha . Unlike these , the Dionycha have only two instead of three tarsal claws . The central third claw of the Trionycha is responsible for tracking the silk thread . Instead of this claw , Dionycha have dense tufts of scupula hairs that produce strong adhesion , enabling some species to climb glass . Most species hunt their prey instead of building webs , although some species of Trionycha ( members of Lycosoidea ) also hunt . There are no cribellate members in the Dionycha . The monophyly of the Dionycha has been disputed . Today it is thought that the reduction of the third claw evolved several times independently .  - Lygromma is a spider genus of Central and South America. There are species with eight, six (e.g. \\"L. senoculatum\\", \\"L. valencianum\\") and no eyes. The eyeless \\"L. anops\\" is endemic to Galapagos, while the not closely related blind \\"L. gertschi\\" is found only on Jamaica.  - Tarantulas comprise a group of large and often hairy arachnids belonging to the Theraphosidae family of spiders, of which approximately 900 species have been identified. This article only describes members of Theraphosidae, although some other members of the same suborder are commonly referred to as \\"tarantulas\\". Except in cases of anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction) no species of tarantula are dangerous to humans, and some species have become popular in the exotic pet trade.  - Opisthothelae is a taxon within Order Araneae, consisting of the Mygalomorphae and the Araneomorphae, but excluding the Mesothelae. Opisthothelae is sometimes presented as an unranked clade and sometimes as a suborder of the Araneae. In the latter case, Mygalomorphae and Araneomorphae are treated as infraorders.  - Araneomorphae (sometimes referred to as Labidognatha) is an infraorder of spiders. They are distinguished by having fangs that oppose each other and cross in a pinching action, in contrast to the Mygalomorphae (tarantulas and their close kin), which have fangs that are nearly parallel in alignment. Both Araneomorphae and Mygalomorphae belong to the suborder Opisthothelae, which comprises nearly all extant species of spider. Mesothelae, the only other suborder in Aranea, includes only about 100 living species.   - The Gnaphosoidea or gnaphosoids are a superfamily of araneomorph spiders with seven families. A 2014 study did not find the group to be monophyletic.    What object entity has the relation of 'instance of' with the subject 'dionycha'?

Throughout its eight seasons, the show garnered numerous awards and nominations, some of which include the Australian Film Institute Awards, the Logie Awards (Australia's television industry awards), and the Australian Writers' Guild Awards. McLeod's Daughters focused on the lives of two sisters who reunite after several years apart and decide to take over their father's cattle farm in the Australian Outback. The show's prominent themes of family, friendship, romance, and rural life certainly appealed to a wide audience, both in Australia and internationally. The relatable storylines and engaging characters resonated with viewers, making McLeod's Daughters a beloved and successful series.

Please answer the following question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Is it possible that the sinking of the Titanic was caused by a ghost? A plot of the story below is true ... but did it really happen quite like this? Our story begins not in the icy cold waters of the North Atlantic, but rather thousands of miles away in Egypt. It is here, perhaps, that we can find the start of the mystery   of the Titanic, in the year 1910, in the great city of Cairo. One day, a famous professor of Egyptian history called Douglas Murray was staying in Cairo, when he was contacted by an American adventurer. The American had something unusual to offer Murray, something that was certain to thrill him: a beautiful ancient Egyptian mummy case, containing the mummy of an Egyptian queen. It was over 3,000 years old, but in beautiful condition -- gold, with bright paintings on it. Murray was delighted with both the object and the askingprice. He gave the man a cheque immediately. The cheque was never cashed. That evening the American adventurer died. For his part, Murray arranged to have the treasure sent back to Britain. However, it was not long before he learnt more about the beautiful mummy case: On the walls of the tomb in which it had been discovered, there were messages which warned of terrible consequences to anyone who broke into the tomb. Murray was disbelieving of these warnings until a few days later, when a gun he was holding exploded in his hand, shattering his arm. The arm had to be cut off. After the accident, Murray decided to return to his homeland. On the return journey, two of his companions died mysteriously, and two servants who had handled the mummy also passed away. The nowterrified Murray decided he would get rid of the _ case as soon as he arrived in London. A lady he knew named Janet Jones said she would like it, so he gave it to her. Shortly afterwards, Jones' mother died, and she herself caught a strange disease. She tried returning the mummy, but naturally Murray refused it. In the end, it was presented to the British Museum. Even in the museum, the mummy apparently... Question: What is the main purpose of this passage? Options: A: To entertain readers with a story of mystery.

Question: suppose there is no kidney's in the body happens, how will it affect less chemical compounds produced.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect The answer is:","output":"C: no effect The question seems to combine two different concepts: acid rain and the role of kidneys in the human body. Let's discuss these concepts separately to better understand the answer. 1. The process described in the question refers to acid rain - a consequence of air pollution. When human industry produces chemical compounds like sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx), they are released into the air and mix with other natural substances in the atmosphere. These compounds then dissolve in water droplets within clouds, forming acidic solutions. When it rains, the affected (acidic) rain falls to the earth, potentially harming natural ecosystems and man-made structures. 2. Kidneys are essential organs in the human body responsible for filtering waste products from the blood, regulating blood pressure, electrolyte balance, and red blood cell production. They have no direct influence on the chemical compounds produced by human industry related to acid rain. Therefore, the absence of kidneys in the human body would not affect the production of industrial chemical compounds related to acid rain.

This would be a human characteristic when preparing lobsters for eating. +Produce light: While some marine organisms have the ability to produce light (bioluminescence), lobsters are not known to have special structures specifically for producing light. +Staying warm: Lobsters, being cold-blooded animals, do not have any special structures for staying warm. +Butter: This answer does not make sense as lobsters are not involved in butter production or connection with their biological structures. +Maine: This answer refers to a geographical location, not a specific biological structure of lobsters. +Layers of fat: Lobsters do not have layers of fat as mammals do. They store energy in different ways, such as glycogen and lipoproteins in their hepatopancreas. +Tastiness: While lobsters are often considered a delicacy, \\"tastiness\\" is not a special structure.

Background: Namdev, also transliterated as Namdeo and Namadeva, (traditionally, c. 1270 - c. 1350) was a poet-saint from Maharashtra, India who is significant to the Varkari sect of Hinduism. He is also venerated in Sikhism, as well as Hindu warrior-ascetic traditions such as the Dadupanthis and the Niranjani Sampraday that emerged in north India during the Islamic rule. The details of Namdev's life are unclear. He is the subject of many miracle-filled hagiographies composed centuries after he died. Context: Namdev's padas are not mere poems, according to Callewaert and Lath. Like other Bhakti movement sants, Namdev composed bhajans, that is songs meant to be sung to music. A Bhajan literally means \\"a thing enjoyed or shared\\". Namdev's songs were composed to be melodious and carry a spiritual message. They built on one among the many ancient Indian traditions for making music and singing. Namdev's bhajans, note Callewaert and Lath, deployed particular species of Raag, used Bhanita (or Chhap, a stamp of the composer's name inside the poem, in his case Nama), applied a Tek (or dhruva, repeated refrain) and a meter than helps harmonise the wording with the musical instrument, all according to Sangita manuals refined from the 8th to 13th centuries.  The musical genre of Namdev's literary works was a form of Prabandha - itself a very large and rich genre that includes dhrupad, thumri, tappa, geet, bhajan and other species. In some species of Indian music, it is the music that dominates while words and their meaning are secondary. In contrast, in Namdev's bhajan the spiritual message in the words has a central role, and the structure resonates with the singing and music. The songs and music that went with Namdev's works, were usually transmitted verbally across generations, in a guru-sisya-parampara (teacher-student tradition), within singing gharanas (family-like musical units).  Callewaert and Lath state that, \\"each single song of Namdev is a musical and textual unit and this unit is the basis for textual considerations\\". The unit contained Antaras, which are the smallest independent unit within that can be shifted around, dropped or added, without affecting the harmony or meaning, when a bhajan is being sung with music. In Namdev's songs, the dominant pattern is Caturasra, or an avarta with the 4x4 square pattern of musical matras (beat). Question: What is Bhajans?. Whats the answer?","output":"Bhajans are special songs that people sing to show their love and devotion to God. They are like happy and enjoyable songs that make people feel closer to God. People usually sing Bhajans in groups, with music and lots of instruments, making them sound beautiful and fun. These songs often have a deep and meaningful message about being a good person and loving God. Just like you enjoy singing happy songs, people sing Bhajans to feel happy and connected to God."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you're shown a three-part story, with a beginning, middle, and ending.

The prison officials arrange these fights and place large side-bets to make a personal profit, often at the expense of the fighters.Once inside, the warden and legal adviser for Chambers state that if he fights Yuri in the ring, he will likely get an expedited appeal and early release.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. PUT THE CAMERA ON ME is a deceptively cute film. It is actually a complex glimpse at the psychology of children and offers interesting insights into the development of adults and an artist. On the surface this is a nostalgic look at some home movies made in the 80's by a group of upper class neighborhood kids. One of the film's directors, Darren Stein, had access to a video camera and quickly took over as the artistic leader for all of the movies. Sure, these are just some cute kids having fun. But, this is also much more. This is a look into some moments in time as children grapple with a number of confusing issues that all of us face in life --- fear, sexual awakening, unrequited love, loneliness and just trying to make sense of the adult world which seems to explode all around us. As we get older we tend to forget how overwhlelming the realities of life were when we were little.  What makes this film all the more valid is to watch a young Darren Stein turn into a little general of a filmmaker. It is clear that Darren is running this show and these little movies are his vision but they are all informed by his friends, their problems, the interpersonal dynamics and the general confusion regarding the horrors of adult life. A lot of children make home movies, but I've never heard of or seen children create \\"little\\" movies about the holocaust, homosexuality, nuclear war and the inability to fit in and make friends. These kids are confronting and dealing with some heavy stuff!  The power of this film is the way Stein and Shell pull various scenes together so tightly with running interviews with the kids --- all now adults and all still friends. This adds a new angle to the film. How many of us have stayed in touch with our childhood friends? These guys have. And, many of the issues with which they were dealing are still running between them two decades later.  Among the conflicts -- a confession of a crush reveals a heart still broken, a very normal childhood sexual experience continues to be a \\"sticky\\" subject between two of the men, some ongoing resentments over the dynamics of relationships and there is still a member of this team who remains very much in charge and in center stage! Which makes perfect sense as one watches these home movies progress over the course of a couple of years. Darren Stein is a director. No doubt about it.  Stein and Shell take turns chatting with each other from time to time and one can't help but imagine the awkwardness of allowing us to peek into the young lives of these people. This is particularly true for Stein who has gone on to a great deal of success in the entertainment industry as a film producer, writer and director. From the first moment of PUT THE CAMERA ON ME we can see the emergence of a gay little boy trying to figure it all out. We also see sides of the artistic mind and personality that are not always \\"nice\\" or \\"caring\\" --- and, this is a bold move for any artist to share with an audience.  There are so many revealing moments, but the most disturbing and complex moments involve a movie in which we see a Jewish concentration camp victim being tortured and killed by a Nazi. We discover thru interviews and narration that the Nazi is played by a Jewish child and the part of the victim is played by a gentile child. It is a painfully disturbing moment that glimpses into the darker side of fear and the way children work thru the horrors of the adult world that are beyond adult understanding much less that of a child.  This is much more than some home movies. This documentary captures the pain, beauty, joy and sadness of growing up.

Davis said the book is well written which helps kids get involved in the story. \\"The book talks about what all children go through,like 'I was naughty but my mommy still loves me'\\" Davis said. The book also encourages children to face their fears.\\"I think it's really good to show that Max is friends with the monsters,\\" Davis said.\\"Kids can find out monsters aren't always the thing under the bed that's going to scare them.I think this is good because it shows that the children can go to scary places but still have a positive experience.\\" Since the book has been successful throughout the years,a movie was recently made and many people are excited to see it.Davis said she thinks the movie will be wonderful but it might be a little scary for younger children.\\"You don't want bad dreams over a book that's extremely wonderful'\\" Davis said.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Answer the following question: Information:  - Murder is the unlawful killing of another human without justification or valid excuse, especially the unlawful killing of another human being with malice aforethought. This state of mind may, depending upon the jurisdiction, distinguish murder from other forms of unlawful homicide, such as manslaughter. Manslaughter is a killing committed in the absence of \\"malice\\", brought about by reasonable provocation, or diminished capacity. \\"Involuntary\\" manslaughter, where it is recognized, is a killing that lacks all but the most attenuated guilty intent (\\"mens rea\\"), recklessness.  - William Palmer ( 6 August 1824 -- 14 June 1856 ) , also known as the Rugeley Poisoner or the Prince of Poisoners , was an English doctor found guilty of murder in one of the most notorious cases of the 19th century . Charles Dickens called Palmer \`\` the greatest villain that ever stood in the Old Bailey '' . Palmer was convicted for the 1855 murder of his friend John Cook , and was executed in public by hanging the following year . He had poisoned Cook with strychnine , and was suspected of poisoning several other people including his brother and his mother - in - law , as well as four of his children who died of \`\` convulsions '' before their first birthdays . Palmer made large sums of money from the deaths of his wife and brother after collecting on life insurance , and by defrauding his wealthy mother out of thousands of pounds , all of which he lost through gambling on horses .  - Charles John Huffam Dickens (7 February 1812  9 June 1870) was an English writer and social critic. He created some of the world's best-known fictional characters and is regarded by many as the greatest novelist of the Victorian era. His works enjoyed unprecedented popularity during his lifetime, and by the twentieth century critics and scholars had recognised him as a literary genius. His novels and short stories enjoy lasting popularity.  - Homicide refers to one human being killing another. Homicides can be divided into many overlapping types, including murder, manslaughter, justifiable homicide, killing in war, euthanasia, and capital punishment and abortion, depending on the circumstances of the death. These different types of homicides are often treated very differently in human societies; some are considered crimes, while others are permitted or even ordered by the legal system.    Given the information, choose the subject and object entities that have the relation of 'penalty'. Answer:","output":"The subject entity in relation to 'penalty' is William Palmer, and the object entity is the public hanging as his punishment for the crime of murder."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It curls up, feeds and grows stronger when its host is afraid, effectively crushing the person's spine if curled up long enough. The host can weaken the creature and stop its curling by screaming. Movie theater owner Oliver Higgins (Coolidge), who shows exclusively silent films, is an acquaintance of Dr. Chapin. Higgins's wife Martha (Evelyn), who is deaf and mute, dies of fright after weird, apparently supernatural events have occurred in her room. During her autopsy, Chapin removes the Tingler from her spine. After they have contained the Tingler and return to Higgins' house, it is revealed that Higgins is the murderer; he frightened his wife to death knowing that she could not scream because she was mute. The centipede-like creature eventually breaks free from the container that held it in and is released into the theater where the deaf mute woman ran before she died. Chapin wishes not to tell anyone, knowing it would start a panic. The Tingler latches onto a woman's leg, and she screams until it releases its grip. Chapin controls the situation by shutting off the lights and telling everyone in the theater to scream. When the Tingler has left the showing room, they resume the movie and go to the projection room where they find the Tingler and capture it. Guessing that the only way to neutralize the Tingler is to reinsert it inside Martha's body, Chapin does so. After he leaves, Higgins, who has admitted his guilt to Chapin, is alone in the room. As if by supernatural forces, the door slams shut and locks itself and the window closes, echoing what happened just before Martha was frightened to death. The Tingler causes the body of Martha to rise from the bed, staring at her husband. Higgins is so terrified that he is unable to scream. The screen fades, and there is the...

Question: What would use an account book?  Choices:  - desk drawer - purse - bank - keep accounts - keep track of emails  The rationale to choose \\"bank\\" as the answer is that: Answer:","output":"The most appropriate answer to the question \\"What would use an account book?\\" is \\"bank.\\" The rationale for choosing \\"bank\\" as the answer in comparison to the other options is based on the primary function and purpose of account books and their relevance to banking processes. The detailed reasoning behind this choice can be broken down into several aspects: 1. Relevance to Banking Activities: Banks handle various financial transactions and maintain records of all the account activities of their customers. An account book serves as a tool to record and keep track of these transactions systematically. Usage of account books has deep historical roots in banking activities, dating back to early banking systems. 2. Account Management: Within the context of banks, account books are used to keep accounts. This choice refers to the act of maintaining precise records of financial transactions in individual customer accounts, ensuring accuracy and completeness. Account books provide a systematic approach to record debits and credits, along with noting the details of each transaction. 3. Auditing and Compliance: Banks are required to adhere to various regulatory guidelines and must be able to provide accurate and reliable financial records for auditing purposes. Account books serve as essential tools for maintaining records that can be audited and used as documentation by regulatory bodies for ensuring compliance of banks with the necessary financial laws and regulations. 4. Historical Progression: Although modern banks have mostly transitioned to digital record-keeping, account books were once a ubiquitous tool for maintaining records of various financial transactions and events. Account books hold historical significance in the field of banking and remain relevant to the understanding of the evolution of banking practices. 5. Inadequacy of Alternative Choices:     a. Desk Drawer: This choice is irrelevant to the question since a desk drawer is merely a physical storage space and does not utilize an account book.     b. Purse: A purse is a personal item used for carrying money and small belongings, and it is not an appropriate choice for utilizing an account book. Accounting records are typically maintained in more formal settings such as ledgers and digital databases, rather than purses.     c. Keep accounts: Although this choice reflects the actual usage of an account book, it lacks a specific subject to associate it with. Within the context of the question, \\"bank\\" is the most relevant subject that keeps accounts.     d. Keep track of emails: This option is unrelated to the purpose of an account book, which deals primarily with financial transactions and not electronic communication. Thus, based on the most fitting application and relevance of account books in relation to banking, it is reasonable to choose \\"bank\\" as the answer to the given question."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

What is the answer?","output":"Scott McKenzie sang about San Francisco in his 1967 hit song \\"San Francisco (Be Sure to Wear Flowers in Your Hair).\\" The song was written by John Phillips, a member of The Mamas and the Papas, and it became an iconic anthem for the 1967 Summer of Love. During the mid to late 1960s, the Haight-Ashbury district in San Francisco became a gathering place for thousands of counterculture youth who identified themselves as \\"hippies.\\" They were attracted to the area's unique blend of art, music, and progressive political thought at the time. The Summer of Love was a social phenomenon that took place in San Francisco during the summer of 1967, and it was characterized by the sharp increase in the number of young people who traveled to the city to experience this burgeoning countercultural movement. \\"San Francisco (Be Sure to Wear Flowers in Your Hair)\\" ultimately became a symbol and reflection of that time, capturing the spirit and essence of the movement. The song's lyrics encouraged people to come to San Francisco in search of peace, love, and a sense of unity that had come to define the city during the 1960s. As a result, it served as a rallying cry for the young, artistic, and politically impassioned individuals who sought to change the world during that iconic summer. The song was a huge success upon its release, reaching the top 10 in the United States, the United Kingdom, and several other countries around the world. Although it was McKenzie's only major hit, the song has continued to resonate and has been featured in various films, television programs, and advertisements that have sought to evoke the atmosphere of the 1960s counterculture over the ensuing decades. To sum up, \\"San Francisco (Be Sure to Wear Flowers in Your Hair)\\", the 1967 song sung by Scott McKenzie, was about the city of San Francisco in California. It became a symbol of the Summer of Love and played a significant role in the countercultural movement, making it an important artistic piece from that era."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Fred, the son of Scrooge's deceased sister Fan, has kindly invited his uncle to join them for Christmas dinner in the beginning of the story. However, Scrooge refuses the invitation with disdain, showing his disinterest and contempt for the festivity. Despite this, Fred holds no grudge against Scrooge and genuinely wishes him a Merry Christmas. In Charles Dickens' \\"A Christmas Carol,\\" when the Ghost of Christmas Present brings Scrooge to Fred's home, they witness a warm and festive scene where a group of family members and friends have gathered to share in the Christmas cheer. They are engaging in fun games, eating delicious food, and enjoying each other's company. There is laughter, joy, and lively banter, and even Scrooge's cold-heartedness becomes a subject of light-hearted mockery. During their time observing Fred's household, Scrooge begins to notice the infectious happiness of his nephew and the people around him. He begins to realize how isolating and joyless his life has been, rejecting the warmth, fellowship, and love that could have been a part of his life as well. This visit evokes a sense of regret in Scrooge for not accepting his nephew's invitation and serves as a pivotal moment in his transformation towards understanding the true meaning of Christmas. The visit to Fred's home becomes crucial for Scrooge as it teaches him the value of family and social connections, the importance of kindness and generosity, and the impact that these positive values can have on a person's life. This encounter is one of the many experiences with the three spirits that ultimately lead to Scrooge's redemption and transformation into a kinder, more compassionate, and charitable individual who learns to embrace the spirit of Christmas throughout the year."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer: Videophone calls (also: videocalls, video chat as well as Skype and Skyping in verb form), differ from videoconferencing in that they expect to serve individuals, not groups.  A single-select problem: Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion? pick from the following. a). yes. b). no.","output":"b). no. An example of a videophone call program is Skype, which is a widely popular and free communication software that allows users to make video and voice calls, send instant messages, and share files with other Skype users, as long as they have an internet connection. Skype was first released in 2003 by the founders of the popular file-sharing service Kazaa, and it quickly gained popularity for its ease of use, stable performance, and high-quality audio and video. Skype utilizes Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) technology to transmit calls, data, and multimedia content over the internet. This enables users to communicate with their contacts without the need for traditional telephone lines or cell phone service plans. Instead, users can simply connect their devices, such as computers, smartphones, tablets, or dedicated Skype-compatible hardware, to a stable internet connection. One key feature that differentiates Skype from other messaging and call services is the ability to conduct video calls, which allow people to see each other while they communicate. To do this, Skype users need compatible devices with built-in cameras and microphones. By combining high-quality audio and video in real-time, Skype allows users to experience a more personal way of communication than traditional telephone calls or text-based online messaging. Aside from one-on-one video calls, Skype also offers group video calls, which allows multiple people to join a video call simultaneously. This feature is particularly useful for remote meetings, online classrooms, or social gatherings with friends and family who are far away. In addition to voice and video calls, Skype also supports instant messaging and file sharing, which enhance the communication experience by allowing users to exchange information and documents quickly and easily. Moreover, Skype offers integrations with other software and platforms like Microsoft Office, allowing for seamless collaboration and increased productivity. Over the years, Skype has faced competition from other video call services like Google Hangouts, Apple's FaceTime, and Facebook Messenger. However, with its wide range of features, user-friendly interface, and a ubiquitous presence across different devices and operating systems, Skype continues to be a popular choice for personal and professional videophone call programs."},{"instruction":"The answer to the question: Who falls for the real estate agent? is inside the article: Jordan Sands is an awkward and nerdy 17-year-old girl with a bad case of allergies, who just became the woman of the house after the recent death of her mother.

Miskatonic University Answer:","output":"Title: \\"The Whispering Halls\\" Genre: Horror, Mystery, Thriller Logline: Dr. Albert Wilmarth, a renowned professor at Miskatonic University, stumbles upon an ancient and dangerous secret while researching the university's cryptic past. With the help of his students, he must navigate a web of supernatural conspiracies, deceit, and terror to unveil the horrifying truth that threatens mankind's very existence. Plot: Act 1: Dr. Albert Wilmarth, a dedicated professor of folklore and ancient civilizations, teaches at the prestigious Miskatonic University in Arkham, Massachusetts. He is known for his passion for unraveling mysteries and has a close-knit group of senior students who work closely with him on his various research projects. Late one night, after giving a captivating lecture on the ancient origins of Miskatonic University, Dr. Wilmarth discovers a cryptic and forgotten manuscript in the university's vast underground library, a relic of its past. The manuscript contains mentions of secret societies, otherworldly entities, and rituals performed deep within the university's mysterious history. Fascinated by this revelation, Dr. Wilmarth enlists the help of his most trusted students: the curious and resourceful Jane; the skeptical and analytical Richard; and the perceptive and gifted artist, Olivia. Together, they embark on a mission to investigate the dark and foreboding passages of Miskatonic University’s history. Act 2: As their investigation deepens, the team slowly begins to uncover the truth behind the university's founding members, who were heavily involved with secretive and blasphemous rituals drawn from the Necronomicon, a fabled book said to contain the darkest knowledge of the universe. These men, the founders of the university, sought to harness the power of ancient gods in order to obtain limitless knowledge, but inevitably lost control, leaving behind a hidden legacy of horror that still lurks behind the veneer of academia. As they dig further, Dr. Wilmarth and his students start to experience unexplained occurrences - whispering voices in the night, ghostly apparitions, and haunting nightmares. The closer they get to the truth, the more ominous the events become, and they soon realize they are in grave danger. Act 3: Despite mixed feelings of fear and disbelief, Dr. Wilmarth and his students persist in their investigation. They discover a hidden passage leading from the heart of the university to a cavernous chamber below, where the founders once performed their eldritch rituals. Here they find a horrifying secret - the summoning of an ancient and malevolent god, which has been lying dormant for centuries. Realizing the danger they have awakened, Dr. Wilmarth and his team race against time to uncover a way to banish the entity once and for all. As the ancient god grows stronger, the team faces numerous obstacles - betrayal from within their ranks, opposition from the university's administration, and the temptation of the god's promise of boundless knowledge. In a thrilling climax, Dr. Wilmarth and his remaining students retrieve the stolen missing pages of the Necronomicon, decipher the banishment ritual, and confront the ancient god. In a final battle of wits and courage, they manage to successfully banish the entity back to its dark dimension, potentially preventing an apocalypse. Act 4: In the aftermath of their harrowing ordeal, Dr. Wilmarth and his students are left shaken but ultimately wiser. Though their experiences have forever changed them, they continue to carry the burden of the knowledge they obtained. Miskatonic University hails them as heroes who saved the world from unknown danger, but they remain forever haunted by the unspeakable things they encountered in the whispering halls. And as Albert Wilmarth continues his teaching, he now better understands the true meaning of knowledge and responsibility, warning future generations of the unseen terrors lingering beyond the boundaries of human perception. With themes of knowledge, power, and humanity's predisposition for secrecy and ambition, this film explores our fascination with the unknown and the consequences that come with delving into the darkest corners of our history and ourselves. \\"The Whispering Halls\\" is a chilling, gripping tale that will leave viewers on the edge of their seats, questioning their own desire to seek out the forbidden."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Is Unicode has the explicit aim of transcending the limitations of traditional character encodings, such as those defined by the ISO 8859 standard, which find wide usage in various countries of the world but remain largely incompatible with each other. a good answer to this question?","output":"Multilingual computer processing refers to the ability of a computer system to process, analyze, and manipulate text, data, and communication in multiple languages. It involves the use of various techniques, algorithms, and tools to handle different character sets, language rules, and cultural nuances, thus enabling the exchange of information between people and systems across diverse language barriers. The given statement about Unicode as an answer to the question is partly correct as it addresses only one component of multilingual computer processing. To provide a more comprehensive answer, the focus should be on broader aspects of multilingual processing, which includes but is not limited to character encodings like Unicode. Multilingual computer processing comprises various levels of language processing, such as: 1. Character encoding: This is the first level of multilingual processing, which deals with representing characters from multiple languages in computer systems. Unicode is an essential milestone in this regard, as it aims to standardize character encoding and provide a unique code point for every character in use worldwide. By transcending the limitations of traditional character encoding schemes like the ISO 8859 standard, Unicode allows computer systems to handle text from diverse languages consistently and efficiently. 2. Text processing: At this level, multilingual computer processing involves handling different writing systems, word segmentation, normalization, text directionality, and other language-specific features. For example, certain languages don't have spaces between words, and some have right-to-left writing systems. Computer systems need to be able to identify and process these variations to support multilingual text processing. 3. Natural language processing (NLP): This is a higher level of multilingual processing, which deals with understanding, interpreting, and generating human language in a form that computers can understand. It involves tasks like language detection, translation, information extraction, sentiment analysis, and text generation. NLP algorithms need to be designed and trained to work effectively with multiple languages, considering their grammar, syntax, and semantics. 4. Localization and internationalization: Localization refers to the process of adapting a software application's user interface and content for different languages, cultures, and locales. Internationalization involves designing software applications to support multiple languages and cultural conventions without modifications. To achieve this, developers follow programming practices and standards that ensure easy adaptation for diverse languages and regions. In conclusion, Unicode is an essential aspect of multilingual computer processing as it facilitates the representation of characters and symbols from multiple languages. However, it is only one aspect of the broader field of multilingual computer processing, which encompasses text processing, natural language processing, localization, and internationalization. To provide a comprehensive answer to the question, it's crucial to widen the discussion to include these additional elements and demonstrate how they collectively contribute to effective multilingual processing in computer systems."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: In 1966,Allen and Beatrice Garden, two professors at the University of Nevada in Reno, had a bright idea.They were interested in the evolution of language and the language abilities of great apes  . Previous attempts to teach chimpanzees  to talk had ended in failure and the matter was considered by most people to be closed. But the Gardens realized that speech and the language are not the same thing. Many deaf people, for example, are unable to speak but are perfectly able to communicate by gestures that have all the features of spoken language. The Garders suspected that previous experiments had failed because chimpanzees are physically unable to speak.    They therefore decided to try teaching a chimpanzee to sign in the way that deaf people do. And their chosen  _ , a female chimpanzee named Washoe after the country in which the university is, proved to be a skillful pupil. Though there is still debate about whether what Washoe learned was really equal to human language, there is no doubt that she learned a lot of words. All of this, however, raises a second question. If Washoe can learn a complex vocabulary of gestures from people, do they have such vocabularies naturally ? To examine that possibility, Amy Pollick and Frans de Waal of Emory University have looked at gestures and expressions in chimpanzees,    Signaling by facial and oral expressions is common among primates  . Signaling by gestures is limited to great apes. The researchers supposed that the meaning of expressions has been fixed by evolution while the meaning of gestures is learnt. If that were true, particular sorts of facial and oral expressions would occur only in particular circumstances, and this would be the same across groups and even species. The same gestures, on the contrary, would be used in different circumstances. The researchers found exactly what they expected. Expressions almost always occurred in the same circumstances in different groups and different species. Gestures seemed to have completely different meanings.... Question: According to Pollick and Waal gestures are different from facial and oral expressions in that   _  . - the meaning of facial and oral expressions can vary with circumstances. - particular gestures occur only in particular circumstances. - facial and oral gestures are not born but learnt. - gestures are limited to a certain type of primates. Answer:","output":"According to Pollick and Waal, gestures are different from facial and oral expressions in that gestures are limited to a certain type of primates - great apes.

Article:","output":"Title: Eastbourne Council Develops Plans to Upgrade Facilities for Renowned Tennis Tournament Plans are in the works to enhance the facilities used in one of the world's most prestigious grass court tennis tournaments, right in the heart of Eastbourne. The Eastbourne council has undertaken the responsibility of drafting proposals to improve the location and amenities, aiming to make the tournament more attractive to potential visitors and further elevate the significance of the event on a global stage. The annual tournament held in Eastbourne, which has become an essential fixture on the grass court tennis calendar, has a long history of attracting world-class players and boasts a solid reputation for competitive gameplay and the highest standard of sportsmanship. However, with the continuous growth of the tennis industry and the rising level of competition between events, it has become necessary to ensure that the hosting facilities remain up-to-date and can effectively accommodate the needs of participants and spectators alike. An essential element of enhancing Eastbourne's tennis facilities is to focus on the overall visitor experience. Ideas are being considered to create a more inviting atmosphere for both new and returning attendees, as well as to develop additional features that will specifically cater to the needs of visiting professional players. Additionally, the council is looking into the possibility of implementing more technologically advanced solutions to streamline various aspects of the event, such as entry, seating, and on-site entertainment options. Upgrades to on-site accommodation, parking and public transportation services will also be vital in ensuring the tournament's continued success. Providing convenient and accessible facilities is likely to draw in more visitors and encourage repeat attendance, in turn, strengthening Eastbourne's reputation as a must-visit event for tennis enthusiasts around the world. Concerns about the environmental impact of large-scale events are gaining attention, and the Eastbourne council recognizes the importance of addressing these issues.

He is in a healthy relationship with his girlfriend Grace Connelly (Jennifer Aniston), but also has a mild crush on his co-worker, Susan Ortega (Catherine Bell), who barely seems to notice him. Bruce, however, suffers from constant bad luck, and reaches breaking point when he is passed over for promotion by his rival, Evan Baxter (Steve Carell), who then steals dialogue from Bruce's segment while accepting the promotion on-air. Furious, Bruce aggressively and profanely criticizes the station during his first live report, and is promptly fired.

God offers to give Bruce His powers, to prove that He is doing His job correctly. God gives Bruce two rules that he must follow: firstly, Bruce cannot tell anyone else that he has God's powers; and secondly, Bruce cannot use the powers to interfere with free will. Bruce ignores God and is initially jubilant with the powers, using them for personal gain such as potty-training his dog, exposing a woman by blowing up her dress, transforming his beat-up car into a Saleen S7, and sexually impressing Grace. Bruce also finds ways of using the powers to cause miraculous events to occur at otherwise mundane events that he covers, such as discovering Jimmy Hoffa's body or causing a meteor to harmlessly land near a cook-off, earning him his job back. Bruce then uses his powers to cause Evan to humiliate himself on-air, causing Evan to be fired in favor of Bruce as the new anchor.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. John is an automotive enthusiast. He was visiting the auto show in his city. Two cars caught his attention, car A and car B. Car A was newer and it had catalytic converter. On the contrary, car B was older and didn't have catalytic converter. But he found the design of older car more attractive.  Which car would contribute to less cleaner atmosphere, car A or car B?  Hint: Catalytic converters in cars increase the rates of several important reactions. Unburned hydrocarbons can more easily be converted to carbon dioxide and water in the presence of a catalyst. Additionally, carbon monoxide (a harmful gas produced by incomplete combustion of fuel) is further oxidized to carbon dioxide, and nitrous oxide compounds (which contribute to smog and acid rain) are transformed back into nitrogen and oxygen gases. By passing car exhaust over these catalysts before their release into the air, the emissions from a combustion engine are made into much less harmful substances, resulting in a much cleaner atmosphere.","output":"Based on the information provided, car B (the older car without a catalytic converter) would contribute to a less clean atmosphere. This is because car A has a catalytic converter installed, which helps to reduce the harmful emissions produced by the exhaust system. Catalytic converters facilitate the conversion of unburned hydrocarbons to carbon dioxide and water, oxidize carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide, and transform nitrous oxide compounds back into nitrogen and oxygen gases. These reactions make the emissions from car A's engine less harmful to the atmosphere. On the other hand, car B lacks a catalytic converter, so its exhaust gases do not undergo these cleaning processes. As a result, it releases a higher amount of harmful substances, such as carbon monoxide and nitrous oxide compounds, which contribute to air pollution, smog, and acid rain. Therefore, car B would contribute to a less clean atmosphere compared to car A."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Answer the following question: Question: \\"Where is it?\\"  Context: \\"The archipelago is formed by high points on the rim of the caldera of a submarine volcano that forms a seamount. The volcano is one part of a range that was formed as part of the same process that formed the floor of the Atlantic, and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The top of the seamount has gone through periods of complete submergence, during which its limestone cap was formed by marine organisms, and during the Ice Ages the entire caldera was above sea level, forming an island of approximately two hundred square miles.\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"Based on the context provided, it is clear that the archipelago in question is associated with a seamount, the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, and the formation of the floor of the Atlantic Ocean. Although the exact location of this particular archipelago is not specifically mentioned in the context, the information provided allows us to infer that it must be somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean, along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The Mid-Atlantic Ridge is a massive underwater mountain range running down the center of the Atlantic Ocean, stretching over a distance of 10,000 miles, from the Arctic Ocean to the Southern Atlantic Ocean, near Antarctica. It is formed by tectonic plates separating and creating new ocean floor as molten rock rises from the Earth's mantle. This process results in the formation of submarine volcanoes and seamounts, contributing to the development of various seamounts and archipelagos along the ridge. The description of this archipelago being formed by the high points on the rim of a caldera of a submarine volcano, which is part of the same process that formed the floor of the Atlantic and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, situates it most likely within the Atlantic Ocean, although the precise location cannot be determined without further information. Furthermore, it is mentioned that during the Ice Ages, the entire caldera was above sea level, forming an island of approximately 200 square miles. This suggests that the archipelago could have been substantially larger and more prominent in the past than it is now. This gives us another clue that this archipelago is located in the Atlantic Ocean since the sea level changes during the Ice Ages affected various landmasses and islands across the globe. In conclusion, while the exact location of the archipelago cannot be pinpointed without additional context, it can be inferred that it is situated somewhere within the Atlantic Ocean, along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, and it has experienced significant geological changes over time due to tectonic activity and fluctuations in global sea levels."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The portrait, which was acquired by an anonymous buyer, highlights the continuous global demand for Bacon's work and cements him further as one of the most important artists of the 20th century. Moreover, this exceptional sale shines a new light on George Dyer, who played a major role in Bacon's personal life and creative output. This article delves into the background of this phenomenal portrait sale, Francis Bacon's relationship with George Dyer, and its significance in the art world. Background of the Portrait Sale The iconic portrait of George Dyer was part of a larger auction by a prestigious international auction house.

As the bidding war escalated, the portrait ultimately sold for a staggering £42.2 million, marking a historic moment in the world of art sales. Francis Bacon and George Dyer's Relationship The story of Francis Bacon and George Dyer began in a serendipitous encounter back in 1963 when Dyer, a small-time criminal, broke into the painter's London studio. Rather than turning Dyer into the authorities, Bacon offered him a substantial sum of money to return later that evening. This initial meeting led to a turbulent six-year love affair, which was both passionate and volatile. Their relationship was marked by tumultuous exchanges, periodic breakups and reunions, emotional turmoil, and even violence. Consequently, George Dyer became one of the principal subjects of Francis Bacon's work, featuring in over 40 of his paintings. The impact of their relationship is evident in several of Bacon's most celebrated triptychs which showcase the trajectory of their relationship, from courtship to discord. Bacon's Artistic Vision and Painting Style Known for his distinctive and dark style, Francis Bacon captured the complexity of human emotions and showcased them through his powerful figurative paintings. His daring and innovative approach to the depiction of the human body and psyche marked him as one of the most important British artists in the post-World War II era. The portrait of George Dyer only serves to reaffirm the boldness and strength of the artist's vision. The portrait possesses a haunting beauty as it conveys the torment and vulnerability of Dyer, a man who faced the consequences of his troubled past and struggled with substance abuse. The image encapsulates Bacon's signature style—raw in emotion and unsettling in its display of intimacy. The unique blend of vulnerability and power within the portrait adds to its value, both monetarily and artistically. Significance and Impact on the Art World The outstanding sale of George Dyer's portrait serves as a testament to the enduring legacy and influence of Francis Bacon in the art world. As the demand for his works continues to grow, the sale not only highlights the investment value of his artwork but also underscores the significance of his creative contributions to modern art. Furthermore, the story behind the portrait of George Dyer provides insight into Francis Bacon's personal life and creative process, offering a unique window into the tumultuous relationship that profoundly impacted his art. In conclusion, the historic sale of Francis Bacon's portrait of George Dyer has broken new ground in the art world. As the anonymous collector now revels in owning this piece of art history, the tremendous enthusiasm for Bacon's work remains unstoppable. The poignant portrait of Dyer not only serves as an emblem of the artist's unrivaled skill and vision but also offers an intimate look at the complexity and vulnerability of the human condition—a reason why his art continues to captivate art enthusiasts globally."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the missing first step of the following process:  -  As the plates move, they exert a great force - When the force is large enough, the crust breaks - The stress is released as energy - The energy moves through the Earth in the form of waves - We feel the earthquake - Answer:","output":"The missing first step in the process of the formation and occurrence of an earthquake is the gradual accumulation of stress and strain along the boundaries of tectonic plates.  To provide a more detailed and comprehensive explanation, let's consider the following steps: 1. Gradual accumulation of stress and strain: The Earth's lithosphere is broken into enormous slabs known as tectonic plates. These plates are constantly moving, gradually shifting against one another due to the convection currents in the Earth's mantle. The boundaries between these plates are areas of intense geological activity, where stress and strain build up over time due to their relative motion. 2. As the plates move, they exert a great force: The constant movement of tectonic plates creates significant forces that push, pull, and grind against one another along the plate boundaries. This force can lead to the deformation of the Earth's crust and the formation of various geological features such as mountains, volcanoes, and rift valleys, as the crust is slowly compressed, stretched, or sheared. 3. When the force is large enough, the crust breaks: Eventually, the stress accumulated along the plate boundaries exceeds the strength of the rocks forming the Earth's crust. This causes the crust to fracture or slip along pre-existing faults, which are zones of weakness in the Earth's crust created by previous geological activity. 4. The stress is released as energy: When the crust breaks, it releases the accumulated stress and strain in the form of seismic energy. This energy is then converted into seismic waves, which are generated at the focus of the earthquake, which is the point within the Earth where the initial breaking or slipping occurs. 5. The energy moves through the Earth in the form of waves: Seismic waves travel through the Earth's interior and along its surface in the form of two main wave types: body waves (P and S waves) and surface waves (Love and Rayleigh waves). The body waves can travel through the Earth's interior, while surface waves are restricted to the Earth's surface, causing the ground to shake. 6. We feel the earthquake: As the seismic waves travel through the Earth and reach the surface, the ground shakes, causing the motion we perceive as an earthquake. The intensity of the shaking and the potential damage caused by an earthquake depend on factors such as the magnitude of the seismic event, the depth of the focus, the distance from the epicenter (the point on the Earth's surface directly above the focus), local geological conditions, and the built environment."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Told by Max, he explains that anyone that says his name will awaken him and have him get that person. Richie, a cocky teenager, awakens Marz by shouting his name and throws a rock into his old home. Annoyed, Max then ends the campfire session and sends everyone to their cabins while he goes into town to stock up on supplies.

After the kids have gone to sleep, the rest of the counselors go to the rec room to relax; T.P. and Betsy kiss in a hot tub, unbeknownst that Marz is watching them from outside. Meanwhile, Dave finds out that Richie didn't follow them back, and informs the counselors about this. T.P. searches out into the woods for Richie, and is hung by Marz with a noose up on a tree; he is killed when Marz pulls down his legs and the noose snaps his neck. Marz later returns to the camp and grabs the axe out of the log. While Richie tries looking for a way back to camp, Dave ventures out into the woods due to Betsy worrying about T.P.'s disapperance, and is decapitated by Marz.

Please answer the following question: Jan prolonged their time with Lee because they really liked spending time with them.  Given the context: How would you describe Jan?  Possible answers: they needed more time, As someone who's sneaky, As someone who talks about Lees company A:","output":"In this context, Jan can be described as someone who truly values and appreciates Lee's company. Jan's decision to prolong their time with Lee indicates that they genuinely enjoy spending time with Lee and connect with them on a personal level. This demonstrates that Jan may be a warm, caring, and attentive person who cherishes meaningful bonds and seeks to nurture them. The fact that Jan actively extends their time together also suggests that they are proactive in pursuing and nurturing friendships, highlighting their strong interpersonal skills and emotional intelligence. However, it is essential to acknowledge that one's perception of Jan may vary, considering the limited information available. From another perspective, someone might perceive Jan as someone who needed more time with Lee to accomplish a specific goal or deepen their connection, rather than solely being sneaky or manipulative. In this case, the emphasis would be placed on Jan's determination and assertiveness, which are praiseworthy qualities. Alternatively, one could describe Jan as someone who talks about Lee's company in a positive light, indicating their satisfaction and admiration for the time spent together. This aspect highlights Jan's ability to recognize and appreciate the valuable experiences they share with others, which can be an essential quality for building long-lasting and fulfilling relationships. In short, while multiple interpretations could be drawn from the context provided, Jan appears to be someone who values Lee's company and actively seeks to spend more time with them, emphasizing their positive character traits such as warmth, attentiveness, and emotional intelligence.

Write a title for this article: Champion sailors have been known to learn their craft on Lake Travis, just outside Austin. The hills and topography surrounding the body of water whip up challenging winds, making it a sublime place for budding athletes to refine their tacking and jibbing skills ahead of a lifetime of competition. SailPoint, a digital-identity-management firm with headquarters two miles from the lake, is preparing for a race of its own. Like many companies, SailPoint has contemplated an initial public offering. But global economic headwinds have given the company pause. “The markets are certainly uncertain,” says Mark McClain, CEO and founder of the firm, which has more than 100 million in annual revenue. At presstime, just two U.S. tech companies had gone public this year: SecureWorks scwx , a cybersecurity unit spun off from Dell, and Acacia Communications acia , a fiber-optics purveyor. Dell shoved SecureWorks out the door in April on its way to a 67 billion mega-merger with EMC emc , only to watch the fledgling company’s share price sag. Acacia made a far stronger debut in May. In June the Bain Capital–backed Blue Coat filed for a public offering before reversing course and selling out to Symantec symc , the lumbering antivirus software firm, for 4.6 billion. Line, Twilio, and AppDynamics appear most likely to go public next. The biggest IPO drought in years has put a damper on an otherwise vibrant cybersecurity sector. Not long ago investors plowed funds into the firms at lofty valuations. Now there is a backlog of companies waiting for an exit, among them Veracode, Carbon Black, ForeScout, Okta, Zscaler, and Optiv. For more on tech IPOs, watch this Fortune video: “Financially, SecureWorks is making us all sit back and reevaluate,” says Mike DeCesare, CEO of ForeScout, a network security company with 125 million in annual revenue and a billion-dollar valuation. “The question is, Why would you go public right now? If you don’t need the money, what is it about the current environment that you find attractive?” The clock is ticking. In the business of digital defense, the race to stay ahead of hackers’ attacks means that innovative strategies steadily depreciate. “One of the risks of delaying an IPO is that you could miss your window,” cautions David Cowan, an investor at Bessemer Venture Partners. “You don’t want to be an old private cybersecurity company.” Furthermore, many cybersecurity firms aren’t well suited for public markets, says Asheem Chandna, an investor at Greylock Partners. “We’ll see over the coming couple of years a steady clip of M&A,” he says. SailPoint’s McClain continues to hold his breath. “To use a silly sailing analogy,” he says, “why would you launch your boat in this storm?” A version of this article appears in the July 1, 2016 issue of Fortune with the headline “Fish or Cut Bait.”","output":"Navigating Uncertain Waters: How Cybersecurity Firms Wrestle with the IPO Drought"},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Problem:CONTEXT: Estilo e influencia en bandas posteriores  Led Zeppelin ha sido una de las más influyentes formaciones dentro del desarrollo del hard rock, sentando a su vez las bases de lo que después sería conocido como heavy metal junto con grupos como Black Sabbath o Deep Purple durante la década de 1970. Esto último vino dado con la publicación del disco debut de la banda, Led Zeppelin I, en 1969, el cual incluía un sonido mucho más duro y contundente que el de muchas bandas de la época sin abandonar el sonido orientado hacia el blues presente en el anterior grupo de Jimmy Page, The Yardbirds, en el que se explotaba más dicha tendencia. Durante toda su discografía también se puede observar trazos de música psicodélica heredada de músicos como Jimi Hendrix. El sonido presente en el siguiente trabajo de la formación, Led Zeppelin II, continúa con el sonido de su antecesor mezclando blues, hard rock y psicodelia a partes iguales. El primer cambio de rumbo dentro de la discografía de la banda se da en Led Zeppelin III, en el que el estilo más acústico y folk predomina a lo largo de gran parte de las canciones incluidas en el trabajo, aunque sin abandonar el hard rock presente en los dos anteriores discos del grupo. Sin embargo, el trabajo más importante en la carrera del grupo es para muchos el cuarto álbum, el cual no tiene nombre, pero es conocido como Led Zeppelin IV. Dicha observación viene respaldada por el número de ventas del disco, hasta la fecha el más exitoso de Led Zeppelin en este campo, gracias en gran medida a la inclusión de Stairway to Heaven, la canción más famosa de la banda. El álbum está considerado como pieza clave en la posterior evolución del rock. Después de la publicación del cuarto trabajo del grupo, estos editan Houses of the Holy, en el que se fusiona el hard rock y el blues con elementos tomados del reggae o del funk. De vuelta de nuevo a sus raíces, la banda publica Physical Graffiti bajo la constante estilística de los trabajos de debut, así como Presence y In Through the Out Door.

Write an article based on this summary: – Just three months after welcoming a child together, Janet Jackson and husband Wissam Al Mana are splitting up, according to multiple sources including People and Page Six. The singer and the billionaire Qatari businessman wed in 2012, and TMZ notes that the separation appears to have come exactly at the five-year mark of the marriage—which could have financial implications if the pair had a prenup. Al Mana, 41, is worth significantly more than Jackson, 50, and prenups typically allot more money to the spouse the longer the marriage goes on; they usually include 5- and 10-year marks at which more money is doled out. Their new son, Eissa, could also have prenup implications, TMZ notes. Why the split? Page Six's sources are conflicted, with one claiming the split is amicable and the other saying Jackson thought Al Mana \\"had become too controlling during the pregnancy and she had already allowed him to dictate her appearance and even the way she performed at concerts.\\" She also moved to London at his request—and her mother, Katherine Jackson, recently spent two months there with the family, which the source says is a factor in the split. Janet is worried about her mom, who alleges elder abuse at the hands of her nephew Trent, and the source says she's frustrated that her husband doesn't seem to share her concerns. The split news was reported soon after Katherine Jackson returned to LA. But TMZ says she may not actually have gone to London in the first place to get away from Trent, but rather because of the looming separation.","output":"Once upon a time, a lady named Janet Jackson and a man named Wissam Al Mana got married in 2012. They were very happy and had a baby named Eissa just three months ago. But now, Janet and Wissam have decided to split up, which means they won't be living together as husband and wife anymore. This news has been talked about by many people, like those from the websites People and Page Six. Since Wissam has a lot of money, more than Janet, they might have made an agreement before getting married called a \\"prenup.\\" A prenup usually says that one person will give the other more money if they are married for a certain amount of time, like 5 or 10 years. The reason why Janet and Wissam are splitting up is still not very clear. Some people say it's a friendly decision, which means they are still friends. Others say that Wissam was too controlling during Janet's pregnancy, telling her how to dress and perform on stage. Janet even moved to London because Wissam wanted her to. Another important thing is that Janet's mom, Katherine, was staying with them in London for two months. She is also having a problem with her nephew, Trent, who she says is mean to her. Janet is worried about her mom and feels her husband doesn't care enough. So, it looks like Janet Jackson and Wissam Al Mana aren't going to be together anymore. Sometimes, grown-ups have problems and decide it's better for them to be apart. We hope that they continue to love and take care of their little baby, Eissa."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

As the massive wall of water towered above the vessel, it became apparent that the combination of size, force, and angle of the incoming tidal wave made it a significant threat to the survival and integrity of the small nautical structure.  As the ocean churned, the waves grew taller and more imposing, casting ominous shadows on the surrounding waters. The crew aboard the ship worked frantically to secure all hatches, equipment, and sails, understanding the urgent nature of the situation. The ship's captain, a weathered and seasoned sailor, began barking out orders, ensuring that each task was carried out with precision and haste. Despite the size difference between his ship and the waves, he was determined to see them through this perilous event. Understanding the physics of waves and boat stability, the captain knew that smaller ships generally have a higher likelihood of being capsized, inundated, or crushed in the grip of such colossal waves. As the wave approached the tiny ship, it became essential to adopt a course of action that would maximize the chances of making it through the wall of water without succumbing to its overwhelming power. As the distance between the ship and the wave closed in, the captain turned the ship into the wind, ensuring that it was properly aligned to take on the wave head-on. This maneuver, called \\"pointing into the wind,\\" allowed the ship to strategically use its bow to slice through the wave's surface and minimize the amount of surface area exposed to the wave's force. All crew members braced themselves as the ship lunged forward into the towering mass. With a deafening roar, the wave crashed onto the deck of the ship, sending torrents of water gushing across the vessel. Though the ship shuddered and threatened to break under the immense pressure, it persevered, taking the brunt of the wave's impact on the fortified bow. As they emerged on the other side of the wave, the shaken but intact crew let out a sigh of relief. Despite the ship's minuscule size in comparison to the colossal wave, its crew's knowledge, skill, and determination had seen them through the terrifying ordeal. The waves subsided, and the ocean's temperament eased as the storm weakened. As the ship sailed past the remnants of the behemoth waves, each member of the crew was filled with gratitude and respect for the power of Mother Nature and the tenacity of the human spirit. In that moment, they were a living testament to the ability for even the smallest vessel to overcome the mightiest challenges when backed by the knowledge, skill, and determination of its crew."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Substantial coal deposits in the northeast Sinai are mined at the rate of about 600,000 tonnes (590,000 long tons; 660,000 short tons) per year. Oil and gas are produced in the western desert regions, the Gulf of Suez, and the Nile Delta. Egypt has huge reserves of gas, estimated at 2,180 cubic kilometres (520 cu mi), and LNG up to 2012 exported to many countries.

Please answer the following question: SEOUL — North Korea shut down its Punggye-ri nuclear test site on Thursday to demonstrate its commitment to denuclearization in advance of the planned U.S.-North Korea summit. The development came hours before President Donald Trump called off the highly anticipated meeting. The South Korean government welcomed the North's unilateral nuclear concession to help facilitate a broader agreement with the United States to completely end its nuclear weapons program in exchange for ending punishing sanctions and security guarantees. \\"We are hoping that this action will become the opportunity for complete denuclearization in the future,\\" South Korea Foreign Ministry spokesman Noh Kyu-duk said. However, while the closure of the nuclear test complex is a significant symbolic gesture, analysts are skeptical it will seriously inhibit the Kim Jong Un government's ability to carry out further nuclear tests in the future. \\"That renders the test site unusable, but not forever and it's not like North Korea has a shortage of mountains or people to make new tunnels,\\" said Jeffrey Lewis, the director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies in California, during an interview with Vice News. North Korea conducted all six of its nuclear tests at the Punggye-ri underground site that includes at least two extensive tunnel systems, according the 38 North website that monitors the North's nuclear activities. Each nuclear test conducted at the site was progressively more powerful, with the first bomb detonated in 2006 producing an estimated 1-2 kiloton yield, much less powerful than the 16-kiloton bomb the United States used on Hiroshima during World War II, and the last test in 2017 producing close to a 250-kiloton yield.

She'll be taking it on the 7 PM train to Edinburgh. At Euston Station, Roland Carstairs (Geoffrey Steele) meets Holmes (Basil Rathbone), whom he has hired to guard his mother Lady Margaret (Mary Forbes), who has already boarded the train back home to Scotland. Actually, he's there to guard the Star of Rhodesia, which she has owned for many years, but was the object of an attempted theft when Lady Margaret wore it at a royal function. Holmes is certain the thieves will try again. Apparently, Scotland Yard agrees, as Inspector Lestrade (Dennis Hoey) is also taking the trip. The train begins to pull out, and Watson (Nigel Bruce) and his old army friend Major Duncan-Bleek (Alan Mowbray) barely manage to board. They had bumped into each other, and forgotten the time as they reminisced. Carstairs brings Holmes to his compartment, where his mother is skeptical about the aid of a \\"policeman\\", but she lets Holmes examine the Star.While Holmes, Watson, Duncan-Bleek, and Lady Margaret are in the dining car, Carstairs falls onto the floor of his compartment. Lestrade hears the thud, but finds the door to the Carstairs compartment locked. Holmes arrives and has the attendant (Billy Bevan) open it. They find Carstairs dead and the box that had contained the Star empty. The body shows no wounds aside from a tiny spot of blood, but Holmes declares it's murder, since a thief arriving right after Carstairs died of natural causes is too improbable. Watson, unimpressed with Lestrade's plodding, decides to try questioning suspects himself.

Q: A ploynomial equation is a sum of terms. Here each term is either a constant number, or consists of the variable x raised to a certain power and multiplied by a number. These numbers are called weights. For example, in the polynomial: 2x^2+3x+4, the weights are: 2,3,4. You can present a polynomial with the list of its weights, for example, equation weights = [6, 4] represent the equation 6x + 4 and equation weights = [1, 3, 4] represent the equation 1x^2 + 3x + 4.

Decent fight scenes or not, the acting is REALLY bad, like you can tell they're reading their lines from a card. With painful line delivery by everyone in the cast. Think watching a high school play and cringing at the obvious lack of smoothness in the actor's interactions (weird pauses between different character's lines, combined with hurried line delivery by others). If the movie were all action, this might be forgivable, but a lot of the movie includes plot set-up and Family Guy style, irreverent cut aways (Oh, wow, are they badly done). I'm assuming they were attempting to be funny with these, but it again came off as a bunch of high-schoolers/ college entry students goofing off for the afternoon trying to set up a funny Youtube clip.  Now to the fight scenes. They're not too bad, considering the level of quality seen everywhere else in the film. Nothing great either, certainly not anywhere near the same level as other posters have stated (Nothing like Drunken Master).

Plot title: Revolutionary Road Movie plot: The movie begins at a house party, where Frank Wheeler (Leonardo DiCaprio) eyes April (Kate Winslet) from across the room. They go to the corner, introduce themselves and chat. She says she is learning to be an actress.Next scene we jump immediately to the end of a play, as the curtain is about to come down. We see April on stage upset, and Frank in the audience with a huge frown on his face. Some people clap and cheer and some are really disappointed with the play, walking by Frank as they go on about how terrible it was. Mrs. Helen Givings (Kathy Bates) walks by and compliments Frank that his wife was terrific in the play. Frank smiles and walks away.Frank goes backstage looking for April. On the way he sees Milly Campbell (Kathryn Hahn), who was also in the play. She tells Frank that she and her husband Shep (David Harbour) are ready for a drink. Frank agrees and goes to the private dressing room where he finds a devastated April changing. She asks Frank to tell Milly and Shep they cannot go out for a drink, using their nanny as an excuse. Frank and April argue a bit but Frank obliges. We then see a far shot of Frank and April leaving in the hallway of a high school with obvious distance between the two of them, not saying a word, even when they are in the car.While driving, Frank turns and tells April that it wasn't her fault that the play was bad, it was because it was unprofessional with lousy scripts and amateur actors and actresses around her. Not only does April not appreciate his comments, she asks Frank not to talk about it. They argue some more and Frank pulls the car over. Frank tells April that it's not his fault the play sucked -he is being very supportive and he is not going to put up with anymore of the bullshit she is giving him. April gets out of the car and Frank follows angrily.

A:","output":"Frank starts screaming at April because he believes he has been nothing but supportive of her and doesn't deserve the treatment he's receiving from her. Upon receiving negative feedback about the play, April emotes her disappointment and frustration by withdrawing and lashing out at Frank. He tries to console her by reassuring her it wasn't her fault but the fault of the unprofessional production, but April does not appreciate this and asks him not to discuss it. This dismissal of his support results in Frank's frustration building up, which eventually leads to him pulling the car over and vehemently defending himself, insisting that he's been supportive and does not deserve the hostile treatment she's giving him.

Briarcliff Manor is home to seven Christian churches and two synagogues; three churches (Holy Innocents Anglican Church, Saint Mary's Church and Scarborough Presbyterian Church) are in Scarborough. Other churches in the village are All Saints' Episcopal Church, St. Theresa's Catholic Church, Faith Lutheran Brethren Church, and Briarcliff Congregational Church (United Church of Christ). Jewish synagogues Congregation Sons of Israel and Chabad Lubavitch of Briarcliff Manor & Ossining are in Chilmark.Saint Mary's Episcopal Church, founded in 1839 by William Creighton as Saint Mary's Church, Beechwood, is Briarcliff Manor's oldest church; it was reincorporated in 1945 as Saint Mary's Church of Scarborough. The granite church was built by local stonemasons and paid for by Creighton's wealthy neighbors, including Commodore Matthew Perry, James Watson Webb, William Aspinwall, and Ambrose Kingsland. The church is in near-original condition, with a design based on the 14th-century Gothic St. Mary's parish church in Scarborough, England and the only church with a complete set of William Jay Bolton stained-glass windows. The church, built in 1851, is a contributing property to the National Register-listed Scarborough Historic District. The 338-acre (137 ha) Sleepy Hollow Country Club surrounds the church grounds on three sides. Notable parishioners included Commodore Matthew C. Perry and Washington Irving. Irving, author of \\"Rip Van Winkle\\" and \\"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\\", brought the ivy surrounding the church from Abbotsford (home of Walter Scott).

In July 2006, LL Cool J announced details about his final album with Def Jam Recordings, the only label he has ever been signed to. The album is titled Exit 13. The album was originally scheduled to be executively produced by fellow Queens rapper 50 Cent. Exit 13 was originally slated for a fall 2006 release, however, after a 2-year delay, it was released September 9, 2008 without 50 Cent as the executive producer.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. A boy racer who killed his 19-year-old girlfriend while driving at 'ludicrous' speeds was jailed for six years today. Reckless Paul Reddan, 21, was racing another car when he lost control of his silver Vauxhall Corsa SRi at 70mph in a 50mph zone, hit a war memorial and crashed into a wall. The car burst into flames and Leanne Davies, a trainee hairdresser who was in the front passenger seat, died at the scene from severe head injuries. Leanne Davies, a trainee hairdresser, had sneaked away from her parents on the night of the fatal tragedy because they disapproved of her on-and-off relationship with her boyfriend Paul Reddan, an engineer. A number of witnesses said Paul Reddan had been driving on the wrong side of the road while he had been allegedly racing with Matthew Creed on a stretch of road for at least two miles before the fatal crash. Reddan, an engineer, was found guilty of death by dangerous driving and jailed for six years and banned from driving for five years at Gloucester Crown Court today. Sentencing, Judge Jamie Tabor said: 'Leanne was by all accounts a lovely young girl. 'She had the world before her – then her life was taken away by this absolutely ludicrous driving.' He told Reddan, who turned 21 today: 'I have no doubt at all that you were racing that night. From the moment you got in the car you were driving too fast. 'You were racing in such a way that one witness thought someone would get killed. 'You had been racing for a very long part of your journey in a very dangerous manner. You lost control of your vehicle and you killed Leanne – that is the long and short of it.' The crumpled Vauxhall Corsa which Reddan had bought just three months before the crash in Gloucester. The court heard how Leanne, of Lydbrook, Glos., secretly met up with Reddan on the night of May 31 last year because her parents did not approve of their on-off relationship. She told them she was going to meet her grandmother, but actually went for food at McDonald's with Reddan before getting into his car at around 9pm. But while travelling along the A4136 near Longhope, Glos., he lost control on a bend, hit a war memorial and crashed into a wall. Matthew Creed, 19, was cleared of causing death by dangerous driving in the six-day trial which ended today. It was alleged he was racing Matthew Creed, 19, who was also charged with causing death by dangerous driving but was cleared after a six-day trial. A number of witnesses described how Reddan's Corsa had been very close to Mr Creed's Renault Clio and at one point it was even being driven on the wrong side of the road. The prosecution alleged that the two men had been racing each other for at least two miles before the fatal crash which left Reddan hospitalised for three weeks. One witness, Andrew Barnes, who saw the two cars flash past less than a car length apart, only a few hundred metres before the collision, said 'someone is going to die', the court heard. Leanne's parents, Paul and Heather, said their whole family had been affected by the loss of the hairdresser. An examination of Reddan's car following the incident showed the speedometer stuck at 60mph, the back tyres under-inflated and a defect in the brake pipe. It was concluded that the car's faults, in combination with the 'manner of driving', could have caused the vehicle to become unstable. In a victim impact statement read in court, Leanne's father Paul Davies said: 'The hardest thing to come to terms with is to think about all the things we can no longer do as a family. 'We recently attended a family wedding and I could not stop thinking about the fact I will never get to walk my only daughter down the aisle. Father Paul Davies said in a victim impact statement read in court today that the 'the hardest thing to come to terms with is to think about all the things we can no longer do as a family' and that he was 'angry' over the loss. 'Whatever the outcome of this case and whatever the sentence, Paul will always have his life and future, but Leanne will never have that.' Mr Davies said the loss of his daughter had affected 'every single aspect of my life' and he was angry he would never be able to walk her down the aisle for her wedding one day. His two sons Luke and Mitch had been badly affected, too and the whole family had received counselling and support, he said. 'The biggest surprise after this incident is that there has been absolutely no remorse shown by Paul Reddan whatsoever. 'We received one letter from him but he didn't even say he was sorry. He did say 'I am sorry you lost Leanne' but there was no hint of sorrow or regret about what had happened. Leanne Davies' parents Paul and Heather (pictured left) with the family liaison officer PC Steve Martin and one of Leanne's brothers Luke Davies, outside  Gloucester Crown Court following the sentencing of Paul Reddan. 'It appears to have had no effect on him whatsoever.' Heather Davies, Leanne's mother, said: 'At just 19 she had her whole life ahead of her. Her dreams and ambitions will now be unfulfilled because of the events of that night.' She said Leanne had an argument with her dad that night about a forthcoming family holiday and whether Reddan would be joining them because of the on-off nature of their relationship at that time. Mr Davies had regretted the row ever since because it had been the last time he saw his daughter. The couple were asleep on the sofa in front of the TV at midnight when police arrived to tell them Leanne had been killed, said Mrs Davies. 'I will never be able to forgive Paul Reddan for what happened that night,' she said. The crumpled Corsa after the fatal crash which claimed the life of trainee hairdresser Leanne Davies, 19. 'My only hope is that one day life will become easier and I can remember Leanne for who she was: my beautiful loving daughter.' Jason Coulter, acting for Reddan, said he had led an honest and industrious life and had no previous convictions - and was never likely to offend again. He accepted, however, that not long before the tragedy Reddan had been driving at 120mph, when a passenger took a picture of his speedometer. Mr Coulter said that although Reddan had not appeared remorseful in public his mother had seen him in tears at home and he 'very much mourns the passing of Leanne.' The solicitor also handed the judge a letter written by Reddan expressing his sorrow. Reddan had worked for his employers for two and a half years, had completed an engineering apprenticeship, and was earning £25,000 as a buyer of equipment for industrial pipework, he added. The court heard that the back tyres of Reddan's Corsa were under-inflated and there was a defect in the brake pipe and, in combination with the 'manner of driving', could have caused the vehicle to become unstable. Reddan, of Broadwell, Glos., had passed his test in January 2012 and had got the 1.8 litre car less than three months before the smash, the court heard. Passing sentence Judge Tabor told Reddan he had not seen any remorse from him and he had 'cut an arrogant figure in the witness box' showing a lack of sensitivity to Leanne's parents. The judge said he was satisfied Reddan had been 'racing for a very prolonged period in a very dangerous manner.' Reddan was told he will have to take an extended test before driving again and he will have to pay a £120 surcharge in addition to the jail term and ban. Leanne's family released a statement after today's sentencing in which they said 'We, the family of Leanne Davies, welcome the verdict handed down by the court today. 'We wish to thank the court, Mr Tully and his team at the CPS, and the police for their meticulous investigation into the truth of what happened that tragic evening. 'Our lives have been on hold since that night, whilst Mr Reddan has been able to carry on with his, showing no remorse whatsoever for his actions. 'We hope that with this trial now over we can start to move on with our lives and focus on our many fond memories of Leanne. 'And finally we would like to thank all of our friends and family for their continued support.' The officer in charge of the case, PC Tim Griffiths, said: 'It is nearly 18 months since the collision and during that time the family of Leanne Davies have been supported by one of the Constabulary's Family Liaison Officers. 'Leanne's family have remained dignified throughout the investigation and court process. 'It has been a long, painstaking investigation which has been reliant on the local community from Longhope and across the Forest of Dean who have supported our investigation. 'During this period my thoughts have remained with the family whilst focused on establishing one thing, what happened to Leanne. 'I remember one thing, a promise that I made to them: on behalf of the investigation team, that we would do our utmost to find out what happened to their daughter. 'This investigation and trial I hope has done just that, and though they will never ever get over the loss of their much loved and well-liked daughter, I hope that in some small way it helps them to move forward in their lives and to put this terrible tragedy behind them. 'My thoughts and condolences are with all of Leanne's family and friends at this very difficult time. 'The investigation team and I take no pleasure in this guilty conviction, as clearly we would prefer never to have had to conduct this investigation into what is clearly a very sad matter. 'It serves as a reminder to us all that cars, particularly when they are driven in such a manner, are killers in the wrong hands. 'Therefore, we must all strive to not only continue to improve the way in which we drive every day, but also accept the responsibility that we all have when we take to the road. He added: 'During the course of this trial this young man has not taken responsibility for his actions or the part he played in Leanne's death.'

Throughout the semester, Maria committed herself to studying diligently and engaging in class discussions, whereas Angela neglected her academic responsibilities and struggled to stay focused on her coursework. From the very beginning of the semester, Maria recognized the importance of effective time management and organization in her pursuit of academic success. Each week, Maria created a detailed study schedule which carved out specific blocks of time for reading, writing, grammar exercises, and reviewing the lessons learned in class. Maria also made a conscious effort to participate actively in class, taking extensive notes, asking questions, and offering insightful commentary during group discussions. By doing so, Maria gained a deeper understanding of the material and reinforced her knowledge, allowing her to excel in quizzes, essay assignments, and class discussions. Conversely, Angela faced difficulties in prioritizing her schoolwork and maintaining a regular study routine. She often procrastinated on assignments, waited until the last minute to study for exams, and seldom completed her reading assignments on time. Although Angela had the intellectual capacity to succeed in the course, she struggled to stay motivated due to her poor organizational skills. Furthermore, Angela's participation in class was minimal, and she frequently missed classes due to her lack of schedule management. Another factor in Maria's success was her willingness to seek help when needed. Whenever Maria encountered a challenging concept or had difficulty with an assignment, she would approach her instructor or fellow classmates for guidance. Maria also utilized online resources and supplemental reading material, which helped her improve her academic performance. Angela, on the other hand, was reluctant to ask for assistance and often felt embarrassed to admit that she was struggling with the course material. This reluctance further hindered her academic progress and led to a decline in her English class performance. As the semester progressed, the gap between Maria and Angela's academic achievements widened. Maria continued to embrace her work ethic and consistently kept up with the course requirements. She made a conscious effort to improve her essay writing skills, which greatly contributed to her earning top marks in the subject. Moreover, Maria's active participation in class discussions had a positive impact on her critical thinking and comprehension skills, enabling her to effectively analyze and interpret texts. Meanwhile, Angela's situation deteriorated, as her lack of diligence and commitment to the course material resulted in the F grade. Her poor time management and irregular study habits took their toll on her academic standing, and she frequently struggled with the class material. Additionally, Angela's inability to seek assistance further isolated her from possible sources of support, such as her classmates and instructor. In conclusion, Maria's A and Angela's F in English class served as a reflection of their contrasting approaches to academics, personal organization, and time management. Maria's success resulted from her dedication, active engagement, and willingness to seek help when needed. Conversely, Angela's poor performance could be attributed to her disorganization, lack of focus, and reluctance to ask for assistance. Ultimately, their differing academic experiences reveal that achieving success in any subject requires dedication, perseverance, and an openness to both giving and receiving support from others."},{"instruction":"Question: Question: what two empires fought to control afghanistan I found the following answer on Google: Following the 1919 Anglo-Afghan War , King Amanullah began a European style modernization of the country but was stopped by the ultra-conservatives.

As the minutes ticked by, Maria and Megan continued to test their limits, feeling the adrenaline surge through their bodies as they pushed themselves to new heights. Finally, after an impressive chase, Maria saw her opportunity and lunged at Megan, managing to tag her just as her friend attempted another evasive maneuver. Both girls, slightly out of breath and red-faced, came to a stop as they reveled in the glory of the moment. Exhausted but elated, Maria and Megan congratulated each other on their impressive display of athleticism and sportsmanship. They knew that one day they would look back fondly on this seemingly simple afternoon of chasing each other around the park, grateful for the memories created and the friendships formed during these long summer days. For now, though, they took a moment to catch their breath and embraced the joys of being young and carefree, eagerly planning their next fun-filled adventure."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This will be the 5th annual ribfest, and John Mee has his work cut out for him to defend the title he won last year (for the second time). I believe he will have a tough time, as the competition looks increasingly focused on unseating the former Bostonian from his Throne. For those of you who haven't been to a ribfest in the past, it's a barbeque competition where 5 to 7 cooks compete to see who can produce the best Baby Back Ribs (if you want those Fred Flintstone beef ribs, you ain't getting them here).

Every year, my wife asks the following: \\t\\"So, besides Ribs, beer and margaritas, what else will be served?\\" I reply:\\t\\"Nothing comes to mind.\\" She replies:\\t\\"No.\\" As you might expect, she wins this discussion year in, year out.

The United Nations (U.N.) is similar to this situation. It's like a big club where countries come together to make big decisions and solve problems.

Given the question: SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear agreement is not expected to derail diplomatic momentum to reach a deal to end North Korea’s nuclear weapons program, but it could complicate the negotiation process, analysts say. Trump on Tuesday announced that the United States is ending its participation in the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) that lifted sanctions on Iran in exchange for Tehran limiting its nuclear program, and would re-impose U.S. economic sanctions on Iran. The agreement was negotiated by the administration of Trump’s predecessor, President Barack Obama, and involved five other world powers; Great Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia. Trump’s National Security Adviser John Bolton said the U.S. decision to re-impose sanctions on Iran will set a higher standard for North Korea nuclear talks by sending, “a very clear signal that the United States will not accept inadequate deals.” The U.S. policy reversal on Iran should not seriously impede diplomatic progress underway with North Korea, said Victor Cha, a noted Korea scholar with the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “In terms of how the North Koreans would take it, I don’t think they’d take it one way or the other. I don’t think they’d see it as negative or positive because they think they’re different from anybody else anyway. They think they’re a very special case,” Cha said at a CSIS conference this week. While the Iran deal limited that country’s efforts to develop a nuclear bomb, North Korea already possesses 20 to 60 nuclear warheads, according assessments by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency, and between 40 to 100 nuclear development facilities, according a report from the RAND Corporation security research organization.

Surveyors are looking for specific types of people, and while you won't qualify for every survey (if you're a 25-year-old healthy hipster and they're looking for a 60-year-old couch potato, you're just not going to make the cut). Many survey companies offer screener surveys when you register, which usually don't pay.  However, it's an important first step, and worth the little extra time it takes to fill these screening surveys out because the more demographic information the market research companies have on you, the more surveys they can send you. Remember, you will only be matched with surveys that you can actually contribute to, so if you leave all your screener information blank to get through it more quickly, you will receive fewer survey opportunities. Keep an eye out on both the site and your email regularly for survey opportunities. Some companies offer surveys more often than others—and you certainly don’t want to miss any of them!  Any individual survey site may only offer a couple of surveys to you in a given month. The more companies you sign up with, the more surveys you'll be able to complete. Set up a rule for your email so that any survey emails that come in are flagged, make noise when they arrive, and appear at the top of your list. Everything you do to make them stand out will help. Once you have lots of surveys available, you can be more selective and pick the ones that seem like the best use of your time. If time isn’t an issue, on the other hand, you can do them all. You're under no obligation to complete any surveys if you don't want to. Summary:","output":"To increase your chances of qualifying for and receiving survey opportunities, follow these steps: 1.

В данном контексте речь идёт об обязательстве Великобритании, в рамках которого страна обязана тратить указанный процент своего ВВП на финансирование различных программ и проектов, направленных на содействие развитию международных проектов.  Это делается с целью интеграции стран развивающегося мира в мировую экономику, создания устойчивых условий для роста и развития местной экономики и инфраструктуры.

Принятие обязательства по расходованию определенной доли ВВП на международную развивающуюся помощь подчеркивает ответственность и лидерскую роль Великобритании на мировой арене.

Answer: oxygen A:","output":"Supporting Fact 1: The functional groups of aldehydes and ketones both contain a carbonyl group (C=O), in which an oxygen atom forms a double bond with a carbon atom. Supporting Fact 2: Carboxylic acids have a carboxyl group (COOH) in their structure, which consists of a carbonyl group (C=O) and a hydroxyl group (OH) bonded to the same carbon atom. In this functional group, there are two oxygen atoms. Supporting Fact 3: Esters have a functional group called an ester group (R-COO-R'), which is formed by the combination of a carbonyl group (C=O) and an ether group (R'-O). In this structure, one oxygen atom forms a double bond with a carbon atom, and another oxygen atom forms a single bond with another carbon atom. Supporting Fact 4: Ethers possess an ether group (R-O-R'), where an oxygen atom is bonded to two carbon-containing groups. This functional group exemplifies the unique ability of oxygen to create a strong bridge between two carbon atoms, facilitating its presence in the ethers' structure.

What is the solution?","output":"To find the solution for f, we will follow these steps: 1. Write down the given equation. 2. Isolate the variable f on one side of the equation. 3. Simplify the equation. 4. Solve the equation. Step 1: Write down the given equation 12 * f + 704 = 76 * f Step 2: Isolate the variable f To do this, we need to move all terms containing f to one side of the equation. Let's move the term 12*f to the right side of the equation by subtracting 12*f from both sides. 12 * f + 704 - 12 * f = 76 * f - 12 * f Step 3: Simplify the equation On the left side, the term 12*f and -12*f cancel each other out. On the right side, we can simplify by combining like terms. 704 = 64 * f Step 4: Solve the equation for f Now, we need to get f by itself on the right side of the equation. To do that, we will divide both sides by 64. 704 / 64 = 64 * f / 64 11 = f So, f = 11 is the solution to the equation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Question: The answer to the question: What were the first names of the people who compiled their tunebook both for public worship and revivals? is inside the article: When originally used in Olney, it is unknown what music, if any, accompanied the verses written by John Newton. Contemporary hymnbooks did not contain music and were simply small books of religious poetry. The first known instance of Newton's lines joined to music was in A Companion to the Countess of Huntingdon's Hymns (London, 1808), where it is set to the tune \\"Hephzibah\\" by English composer John Husband. Common meter hymns were interchangeable with a variety of tunes; more than twenty musical settings of \\"Amazing Grace\\" circulated with varying popularity until 1835 when William Walker assigned Newton's words to a traditional song named \\"New Britain\\", which was itself an amalgamation of two melodies (\\"Gallaher\\" and \\"St. Mary\\") first published in the Columbian Harmony by Charles H. Spilman and Benjamin Shaw (Cincinnati, 1829). Spilman and Shaw, both students at Kentucky's Centre College, compiled their tunebook both for public worship and revivals, to satisfy \\"the wants of the Church in her triumphal march\\". Most of the tunes had been previously published, but \\"Gallaher\\" and \\"St. Mary\\" had not. As neither tune is attributed and both show elements of oral transmission, scholars can only speculate that they are possibly of British origin. A manuscript from 1828 by Lucius Chapin, a famous hymn writer of that time, contains a tune very close to \\"St. Mary\\", but that does not mean that he wrote it.\\"Amazing Grace\\", with the words written by Newton and joined with \\"New Britain\\", the melody most currently associated with it, appeared for the first time in Walker's shape note tunebook Southern Harmony in 1847. It was, according to author Steve Turner, a \\"marriage made in heaven ... The music behind 'amazing' had a sense of awe to it. The music behind 'grace' sounded graceful. There was a rise at the point of confession, as though the author was stepping out into the open and making a bold declaration, but a corresponding fall when admitting his blindness.\\" Walker's collection was enormously popular, selling about..., can you guess it ?

A subplot in the film involves an American couple who encounter difficulties in their relationship because of the ongoing war. Inchon begins with North Korean soldiers moving past the 38th parallel north into South Korea in June 1950. People flee into the country's capital, Seoul. One of the displaced people is Barbara Hallsworth (Jacqueline Bisset), a U.S. Army major's wife who lives in a village on the 38th Parallel. She is chauffered to Seoul in a limousine, picking up five South Korean children along the way. After her chauffeur is killed, she drives them to a safe location called the Inn of the Sixth Happiness. Along the way, she shoots a North Korean soldier. Meanwhile, her husband, Frank Hallsworth (Ben Gazzara), is attempting to break off an affair with a young South Korean woman (Karen Kahn). Her father (Toshiro Mifune) is aware of his daughter's affair with Hallsworth and does not disapprove. Hallsworth receives word of the invasion by the North Koreans, and he travels north in an attempt to locate his wife with the assistance of army sergeant August Henderson (Richard Roundtree). Henderson encounters Hallsworth's wife and fixes her vehicle's battery, and then reunites her with her husband. Journalists David Feld Park (David Janssen) and Longfellow (Rex Reed) are attending a press conference held by MacArthur in Tokyo. MacArthur, however, does not show.

Answer the following question given this paragraph:   Introduction Plants are as essential to human existence as land, water, and air. Without plants, our day-to-day lives would be impossible because without oxygen from photosynthesis, aerobic life cannot be sustained. From providing food and shelter to serving as a source of medicines, oils, perfumes, and industrial products, plants provide humans with numerous valuable resources. When you think of plants, most of the organisms that come to mind are vascular plants. These plants have tissues that conduct food and water, and they have seeds. Seed plants are divided into gymnosperms and angiosperms. Gymnosperms include the needle-leaved conifers—spruce, fir, and pine—as well as less familiar plants, such as ginkgos and cycads. Their seeds are not enclosed by a fleshy fruit. Angiosperms, also called flowering plants, constitute the majority of seed plants. They include broadleaved trees (such as maple, oak, and elm), vegetables (such as potatoes, lettuce, and carrots), grasses, and plants known for the beauty of their flowers (roses, irises, and daffodils, for example). While individual plant species are unique, all share a common structure: a plant body consisting of stems, roots, and leaves. They all transport water, minerals, and sugars produced through photosynthesis through the plant body in a similar manner. All plant species also respond to environmental factors, such as light, gravity, competition, temperature, and predation.   Q: Angiosperms are also known as what?

For example, the body temperature of most organisms is too low for reactions to occur quickly enough to carry out life processes. Reactants may also be present in such low concentrations that it is unlikely they will meet and collide. Therefore, the rate of most biochemical reactions must be increased by a catalyst. A catalyst is a chemical that speeds up chemical reactions. In organisms, catalysts are called enzymes . A:","output":"Based on the information provided, it is apparent that enzymes play a crucial role in facilitating biochemical reactions within organisms. These enzymes function as catalysts, which significantly increase the rate of chemical reactions, enabling organisms to carry out life processes effectively and efficiently. Since organism A possesses enzymes, the chemical reactions within its cells would be noticeably faster compared to organism B, which lacks enzymes. This difference in reaction speeds can be attributed to the catalytic properties of enzymes present in organism A. Enzymes work by lowering the activation energy required for a reaction to occur, which results in a higher likelihood of reactants colliding and forming products. In essence, enzymes optimize the biochemical reactions occurring within cells, making it possible for these reactions to proceed at a rapid pace. On the other hand, organism B, which does not contain enzymes, would have a much slower rate of chemical reactions. The slower reactions are due to the fact that non-catalyzed reactions tend to require higher activation energy. Moreover, as the hint suggests, the body temperature of most organisms is not conducive to rapid reaction rates, so the absence of enzymes in organism B would further hinder the progress of chemical reactions. Furthermore, the low concentration of reactants in the absence of a catalyst makes collisions among them rarer, reducing the overall reaction rate in organism B. This, combined with suboptimal environmental conditions for chemical reactions, would likely hinder organism B's ability to efficiently carry out life-sustaining processes. In summary, organism A, which contains enzymes, would experience speedier chemical reactions compared to organism B, which lacks these essential catalysts. The presence of enzymes in organism A permits biochemical reactions to proceed at a much faster pace, enabling the organism to effectively maintain its physiological processes and overall functionality. Conversely, organism B would likely struggle to support its life processes efficiently due to the slower reaction rates associated with the absence of enzymes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who has a hallucination that they are buried alive?  After a textual montage summarizing Edgar Allan Poe's life, the film begins in late September 1849 with Poe awakening from a hallucination where he is buried alive.  He prepares to take a trip to New York City via a ferry steamboat from Richmond, Virginia, to Baltimore, and from there, another ferry to New York City itself.  He discusses his plans to marry his childhood sweetheart Sarah Elmira Royster with a stranger taking the same steamboat, who suggests that he meet with a few potential investors for his planned magazine The Stylus.  Though Poe had intended only to pass through Baltimore, he agrees to meet the investors who, one by one, turn down his request for funding.  Poe is depicted as having some type of memory loss, which is first evident when he offers to pay his boat fare twice after forgetting he had already paid. In Baltimore, he more than once forgets the arrangements he has made at his hotel as his stay in the city is extended.  One night, he chooses to dine in a local tavern rather than at the hotel.  There, he meets an old friend from his days at West Point.  In desperation, he asks his former classmate and the classmate's companion for money to help start a magazine, saying proudly he has already raised 1,000.  Poe leaves the tavern to retrieve his prospectus for the magazine.  His classmate follows him and beats him up to steal the 1,000 he had collected. An injured and delirious Poe is then found by organizers of a cooping ring.  The author, along with several others, are forced to multiple polling locations around Baltimore to place multiple votes for the candidate for mayor.  A couple of victims of the scam die amidst the brutality of their captors. Answer:","output":"The last name of the person who has a hallucination that they are buried alive is Poe."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the question: Information:  - In epistemology, rationalism is the view that \\"regards reason as the chief source and test of knowledge\\" or \\"any view appealing to reason as a source of knowledge or justification\\". More formally, rationalism is defined as a methodology or a theory \\"in which the criterion of the truth is not sensory but intellectual and deductive\\".  - A capital market is a financial market in which long-term debt or equity-backed securities are bought and sold. Capital markets are defined as markets in which money is provided for periods longer than a year. Capital markets channel the wealth of savers to those who can put it to long-term productive use, such as companies or governments making long-term investments.  Financial regulators, such as the Bank of England (BoE) or the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), oversee the capital markets in their jurisdictions to protect investors against fraud, among other duties.  - Medicine (British English ; American English ) is the science and practice of the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of disease. The word \\"medicine\\" is derived from Latin \\"medicus\\", meaning \\"a physician\\". Medicine encompasses a variety of health care practices evolved to maintain and restore health by the prevention and treatment of illness. Contemporary medicine applies biomedical sciences, biomedical research, genetics, and medical technology to diagnose, treat, and prevent injury and disease, typically through pharmaceuticals or surgery, but also through therapies as diverse as psychotherapy, external splints and traction, medical devices, biologics, and ionizing radiation, amongst others.  - The University of Siena (abbreviation: UNISI) in Siena, Tuscany is one of the oldest and first publicly funded universities in Italy. Originally called \\"Studium Senese\\", the institution was founded in 1240. It had around 20,000 students in 2006, nearly half of Siena's total population of around 54,000. Today, the University of Siena is best known for its Schools of Law and Medicine.  - Latium is the region of central western Italy in which the city of Rome was founded and grew to be the capital city of the Roman Empire. Latium was originally a small triangle of fertile, volcanic soil on which resided the tribe of the Latins or Latians. It was located on the left bank (east and south) of the Tiber river, extending northward to the Anio river (a left-bank tributary of the Tiber) and southeastward to the Pomptina Palus (Pontine Marshes, now the Pontine Fields) as far south as the Circeian promontory. The right bank of the Tiber was occupied by the Etruscan city of Veii, and the other borders were occupied by Italic tribes. Subsequently, Rome defeated Veii and then its Italic neighbors, expanding Latium to the Apennine Mountains in the northeast and to the opposite end of the marsh in the southeast. The modern descendant, the Italian \\"Regione\\" of Lazio, also called \\"Latium\\" in Latin, and occasionally in modern English, is somewhat larger still, but not as much as double the original Latium.  - Rome is a city and special \\"comune\\" (named \\"Roma Capitale\\") in Italy. Rome is the capital of Italy and of the Lazio region. With 2,870,336 residents in , it is also the country's largest and most populated \\"comune\\" and fourth-most populous city in the European Union by population within city limits. The Metropolitan City of Rome has a population of 4.3 million residents. The city is located in the central-western portion of the Italian Peninsula, within Lazio (Latium), along the shores of Tiber river. The Vatican City is an independent country geographically located within the city boundaries of Rome, the only existing example of a country within a city: for this reason Rome has been often defined as capital of two states.   - Marxism is a method of socioeconomic analysis that analyzes class relations and societal conflict using a materialist interpretation of historical development and a dialectical view of social transformation. It originates from the mid-to-late 19th century works of German philosophers Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels.  - Kantian ethics refers to a deontological ethical theory ascribed to the German philosopher Immanuel Kant. The theory, developed as a result of Enlightenment rationalism, is based on the view that the only intrinsically good thing is a good will; an action can only be good if its maximthe principle behind itis duty to the moral law. Central to Kant's construction of the moral law is the categorical imperative, which acts on all people, regardless of their interests or desires. Kant formulated the categorical imperative in various ways. His principle of universalizability requires that, for an action to be permissible, it must be possible to apply it to all people without a contradiction occurring. His formulation of humanity as an end in itself requires that humans are never treated merely as a means to an end, but always also as ends in themselves. The formulation of autonomy concludes that rational agents are bound to the moral law by their own will, while Kant's concept of the Kingdom of Ends requires that people act as if the principles of their actions establish a law for a hypothetical kingdom. Kant also distinguished between perfect and imperfect duties. A perfect duty, such as the duty not to lie, always holds true; an imperfect duty, such as the duty to give to charity, can be made flexible and applied in particular time and place.  - Vatican City , officially Vatican City State or the State of Vatican City, is a walled enclave within the city of Rome. With an area of approximately 44 hectares (110 acres), and a population of 842, it is the smallest State in the world by both area and population, but formally it is not sovereign, sovereignty being held by the Holy See, the only entity of public international law that has diplomatic relations with almost every country in the world.  - Friedrich Engels (or  28 November 1820  5 August 1895) was a German philosopher, social scientist, journalist, and businessman. He founded Marxist theory together with Karl Marx. In 1845, he published \\"The Condition of the Working Class in England\\", based on personal observations and research in Manchester.  - Karl Marx (5 May 1818  14 March 1883) was a German-born scientist, philosopher, economist, sociologist, journalist, and revolutionary socialist. Born in Trier to a middle-class family, he later studied political economy and Hegelian philosophy. As an adult, Marx became stateless and spent much of his life in London, England, where he continued to develop his thought in collaboration with German thinker Friedrich Engels and published various works, the most well-known being the 1848 pamphlet \\"The Communist Manifesto\\". His work has since influenced subsequent intellectual, economic, and political history.  - Capitalism is an economic system based on private ownership of the means of production and their operation for profit. Characteristics central to capitalism include private property, capital accumulation, wage labor, voluntary exchange, a price system, and competitive markets. In a capitalist market economy, decision-making and investment is determined by the owners of the factors of production in financial and capital markets, and prices and the distribution of goods are mainly determined by competition in the market.  - Economic determinism is a theory that economic relationships (such as being an owner or capitalist, or being a worker or proletarian) are the foundation upon which all other social and political arrangements in society are based. The theory stresses that societies are divided into competing economic classes whose relative political power is determined by the nature of the economic system. In the version associated with Karl Marx, the emphasis is on the proletariat who are considered to be locked in a class struggle with the capitalist class, which will eventually end with the revolutionary overthrow of the capitalist system and the gradual development of socialism. Marxist thinkers have dismissed plain and unilateral economic determinism as a form of \\"vulgar Marxism\\", or \\"economism\\", nowhere included in Marx's works.  - Economism is reduction of all social facts to economic dimensions. The term is often used to criticize economics as an ideology, in which supply and demand are the only important factors in decisions, and outstrip or permit ignoring all other factors. It is believed to be a side effect of neoclassical economics and blind faith in an \\"invisible hand\\" or \\"laissez-faire\\" means of making decisions, extended far beyond controlled and regulated markets, and used to make political and military decisions. Conventional ethics would play no role in decisions under pure economism, except insofar as supply would be withheld, demand curtailed, by moral choices of individuals. Thus, critics of economism insist on political and other cultural dimensions in society.  - Law is a system of rules that are created and enforced through social or governmental institutions to regulate behavior. State-enforced laws can be made by a collective legislature or by a single legislator, resulting in statutes, by the executive through decrees and regulations, or established by judges through precedent, normally in common law jurisdictions. Private individuals can create legally binding contracts, including arbitration agreements that may elect to accept alternative arbitration to the normal court process. The formation of laws themselves may be influenced by a constitution, written or tacit, and the rights encoded therein. The law shapes politics, economics, history and society in various ways and serves as a mediator of relations between people.  - Italy, officially the Italian Republic, is a unitary parliamentary republic in Europe. Located in the heart of the Mediterranean Sea, Italy shares open land borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, San Marino and Vatican City. Italy covers an area of and has a largely temperate seasonal climate and Mediterranean climate; due to its shape, it is often referred to in Italy as \\"lo Stivale\\" (the Boot). With 61 million inhabitants, it is the fourth most populous EU member state.  - Determinism is the philosophical position that for every event there exist conditions that could cause no other event. \\"There are many determinisms, depending on what pre-conditions are considered to be determinative of an event or action.\\" Deterministic theories throughout the history of philosophy have sprung from diverse and sometimes overlapping motives and considerations. Some forms of determinism can be empirically tested with ideas from physics and the philosophy of physics. The opposite of determinism is some kind of indeterminism (otherwise called \\"nondeterminism\\"). Determinism is often contrasted with free will.  - Competition is, in general, a contest or rivalry between two or more organisms, animals, individuals, economic groups or social groups, etc., for territory, a niche, for resources, goods, for mates, for prestige, recognition, for awards, for group or social status, or for leadership and profit. It arises whenever at least two parties strive for a goal which cannot be shared, where one's gain is the other's loss (a zero-sum game).  - The concept of universalizability was set out by the 18th-century German philosopher Immanuel Kant as part of his work \\"Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals\\". It is part of the first formulation of his categorical imperative, which states that the only morally acceptable maxims of our actions are those that could rationally be willed to be universal law.   - A market economy is an economic system where decisions regarding investment, production, and distribution are based on the interplay of supply and demand, which determines the prices of goods and services. The major defining characteristic of a market economy is that investment decisions, or the allocation of producer good, are primarily made through capital and financial markets. This is contrasted with a planned economy, where investment and production decisions are embodied in an integrated plan of production established by a state or other organizational body that controls the factors of production.  - A revolution (from the Latin \\"revolutio\\", \\"a turn around\\") is a fundamental change in political power or organizational structures that takes place in a relatively short period of time when the population rises up in revolt against the current authorities. Aristotle described two types of political revolution: Revolutions have occurred through human history and vary widely in terms of methods, duration, and motivating ideology. Their results include major changes in culture, economy, and socio-political institutions.  - The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of member states that are located primarily in Europe. It has an area of , and an estimated population of over 510 million. The EU has developed an internal single market through a standardised system of laws that apply in all member states. EU policies aim to ensure the free movement of people, goods, services, and capital within the internal market, enact legislation in justice and home affairs, and maintain common policies on trade, agriculture, fisheries, and regional development. Within the Schengen Area, passport controls have been abolished. A monetary union was established in 1999 and came into full force in 2002, and is composed of 19 EU member states which use the euro currency.  - Ernesto Screpanti ( born 1948 , Rome ) is a professor of Political Economy at the University of Siena .

The nostalgia associated with the sound of a CD spinning up and the familiar tones resounding from its grooves cannot be denied. However, as with any technology, there's always the possibility of encountering some issues. One of the most common problems is getting a CD stuck inside the player. Fear not, for in this article, we will guide you through a simple process to safely remove that stuck CD using nothing more than another blank or useless CD in a few easy steps. Step 1: Prepare Your Materials For this method, you will need: 1. A blank or useless CD - This could be an old data CD that has no more use or a blank CD that you're willing to part with. 2. Your CD player - We will be focusing on slot-loading CD players in this article. Step 2: Power Off The Device To avoid causing any further damage to the CD player or harming yourself, it is essential to turn off the device before attempting to remove the stuck CD. For car CD players, ensure that the engine is off and that the key is removed from the ignition. Step 3: Insert The Second CD Hold the blank or useless CD with its shiny side facing up. Gently place it into the CD player slot, about 1 inch (2.5 cm) deep. This will help you to make contact with the edge of the stuck CD inside the player. Step 4: Press the \\"Eject\\" Button While keeping the second CD in place, press the \\"Eject\\" button on your CD player. It may require a few tries, but you should eventually hear the familiar sound of the CD player attempting to eject the stuck CD. Step 5: Gently Wiggle The CD As the CD player attempts to eject the stuck CD, gently wiggle the second CD (that you've inserted) from side to side and apply slight upward or downward pressure on the CD player slot itself. This will aim to help dislodge the stuck CD and guide it out of the slot. Step 6: Remove The CDs Upon successful ejection, carefully remove both CDs from the player. It is possible that the stuck CD may be slightly scratched or damaged during the process. Inspect both CDs for any visible damage before attempting to use them in any other device. Conclusion: Even with advancing technology, it doesn't mean that we should leave behind the days of CDs. The simple method detailed in this article will breathe life back into your CD player, enabling you to reminisce with your favorite albums or enjoy your audiobooks in your car. In addition, this method prevents you from the expenses of bringing the unit to a professional or replacing it altogether.

I belong to a very humble and conservative family, from Indore. @I never had a lot of exposure to guys, until we went to attend a marriage of one of our wealthy relatives in Delhi.. it was one of the best times I had, as we had a group of 4–5 similar aged cousins, though most of them were very distant relatives. One of them was a 19 year old dude, and he was kind of cute. But I never thought I would have this urge to you know… it was teenage and everything seemed new and exciting.

I asked him if he wants to come in as my parents were involved in the late night Sangeet rehearsals. He nodded gently and before I could know, we were cuddling and watching TV. I felt like a rebel, though it was the strangest and least expected thing I had done. Then he kissed me. Before I knew it I let him in my mouth …and he kept rolling his tongue on mine. It was my first kiss, and I don't regret it. The warmth of his mouth, the wetness of his lips and his breath felt like the only thing I ever wanted. I was a teen so please not judge.

Article: Many people rely on a cup of coffee or two to wake them up in the morning or refresh them during the working day, but now a chemist has come up with a speedy alternative to drinking coffee. U.S. biochemist Ben Yu has created 'Sprayable Energy', which claims to be the world's first caffeine - based topical energy spray. He said tired workers can spray a 'shot' of caffeine onto their skin without experiencing a strong noise, taking in unnecessary calories or being stuck with a nasty aftertaste like they might get from drinking energy drinks or coffee. The tasteless caffeine spray is absorbed through the skin and spread through the body over a number of hours to deliver a caffeine hit that lasts longer than drinking a cup of coffee. The only active ingredient in the spray is caffeine, which is very similar to nicotine in structure. Each spray 'Sprayable Energy' contains around a quarter of the amount of caffeine found in a cup of coffee, but apparently has the same effect as a full cup. The website said: \\"The reason for this is our product isn't entirely metabolized  by the liver before entering your system and becoming available to your body.\\" Sprayable Energy's website recommends that users apply the spray in places where they normally spritz perfume, such as wrists, the neck or behind the ears, but warns users not to exceed 20 times a day. It claims that after spraying the product on the skin, users will feel awake and focus without being over-excited, which is common with coffee and energy drinks.

Context: The rate of incarceration in the U.S. is the world’s highest, leading to what many lawmakers and policy analysts say is a nationwide imprisonment epidemic. But the beginning of the end of that epidemic started Tuesday, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, a Democrat from New York, told VOA. A bipartisan prison reform bill that passed the U.S. House of Representatives by a 360-59 vote “strikes an opening blow against the overcriminalization of the nation,” Jeffries, one of the bill's co-sponsors, said. U.S. President Donald Trump said “the strong bipartisan vote paces the way for action by the Senate.” Last week, Trump endorsed the bill at a White House summit on prison reform, saying, “Our whole nation benefits if former inmates are able to reenter society as productive, law-abiding citizens.” If the bill reaches the president's desk for a signature, it would provide 50 million in funding for five years to provide job training, education and substance abuse treatment for prisoners as well as a number of quality-of-life measures aimed at reducing chronically high rates of recidivism among former inmates. But the contentious issue of criminal justice reform has split Democrats and Republicans within their own parties, possibly jeopardizing the bill’s chances of passage as it heads to the U.S. Senate. In a letter to colleagues last week, Democratic Senators Kamala Harris, Dick Durbin and Cory Booker joined two House Democratic colleagues, Representatives John Lewis and Sheila Jackson Lee, in saying the bill could not be implemented effectively and could possibly lead to prison privatization. Jeffries told VOA many of the arguments against the First Step Act “were anchored in falsehoods.” He added the legislation passed today “is a first step towards eradicating the cancer of mass incarceration” a move also welcomed by many House Republicans. “Rather than allowing the cycle of crime to continue, this legislation takes a practical, intelligent approach to rehabilitation,” House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte, a Republican...

Ellie Zolfagharifard. Take a look at a map today, and you’re likely to see that North America is larger than Africa, Alaska is larger than Mexico and China is smaller than Greenland. But in reality China is four times bigger than Greenland, Africa is three times bigger than North America and Mexico is larger than Alaska. The distortion is the result of the Mercator projection, the map most commonly seen hanging in classrooms and in text books, which was created in 1596 to help sailors navigate the world. The Mercator projection, the map most commonly seen hanging in classrooms and in text books, was created in 1596 to help sailors navigate the world. The familiar map gives the right shapes of land masses, but at the cost of distorting their sizes in favour of the wealthy lands to the north. You might think that the advent of satellite imagery and tools such as Google maps has improved our view of the world, but this isn’t necessarily the case, according to James Wan writing in the Guardian. Much of this is due to technical reasons, said Mr Wan, while others inconsistences are caused by ideological assumptions that can change the way we see the world. The biggest challenge is that it is impossible to portray the reality of the spherical world on a flat map – a problem that has haunted cartographers for centuries. One of the best alternatives to the Mercator projection was presented in 1974 by D. Arno Peters (pictured). The Gall-Peters projection makes seeing the relative size of places much easier. However it also has its flaws as certain places appear stretched, horizontally near the poles and vertically near the Equator. A depiction of the world by Henricus Martellus. It's said that Columbus used this map or one like it to persuade Ferdinand of Aragon and Isabella of Castile to support him in the early 1490s. The map was made by a German cartographer living in Florence and reflects the latest theories about the form of the world and the most accurate ways of portraying it on a flat surface. Africa is around 14 times larger than Greenland and yet on the map both are almost same size. Brazil is more than five times larger than Alaska, yet Alaska is larger than Brazil on the map. The map suggests that Scandinavian countries are larger than India, whereas in reality India is three times the size of all Scandinavian countries put together. While it looks like Europe is larger than North America on this map, in reality the reverse is true. Russia also isn't as large as it is depicted, with Africa larger than Russia in reality. As a result, shapes of world maps have typically been diverse, ranging from hearts to cones. But the diversity gradually faded away with one model, invented by Gerardus Mercator, surpassing the others. The familiar 'Mercator' projection gives the right shapes of land masses, but at the cost of distorting their sizes in favour of the wealthy lands to the north. For instance, in the Mercator projection, north America looks at least as big, if not slightly larger, than Africa. And Greenland also looks of comparable size. But in reality Africa is larger than both. In fact, you can fit north America into Africa and still have space for India, Argentina, Tunisia and some left over, notes Mr Wan. Greenland, meanwhile, is 1/14th the size of the continent as can be seen in Gall-Peters equal projection, which provides the correct proportion of land mass to the continents. The map suggests that Scandinavian countries are larger than India, whereas in reality India is three times the size of all Scandinavian countries put together. As well, as this, it seems the fact that our maps typically put north at the top is a mere convention but has been accepted as correct in most of the world. Looking back, the diversity of maps can reveal a history of the world. The Chinese Globe which was made for the Chinese Emperor in 1623. The creators exaggerated the size of China and placed it in the middle of a world that otherwise consisted mainly of small offshore islands. The Werner heart-shaped project of the world (left) The fact that our maps typically put north at the top is a mere convention but has been accepted as correct in most of the world. Pictured on the right is a Mercator map turned on its head. For instance, The ‘Be On Guard!’ map was. created in 1921 when infant USSR was threatened with invasion, famine. and social unrest. To counter this, designers such as Dimitri Moor were employed to create pro-Bolshevik propaganda. Using a map of European Russia and its neighbours, Moor's image of a heroic Bolshevik guard defeating the invading 'Whites' helped define the Soviet Union in the Russian popular imagination. An earlier map, called the Hinese Globe, created in 1623 reveals the ancient Chinese view of the world. Made for the Chinese Emperor, this is the earliest known Chinese terrestrial globe, and a fusion of East and Western cultures. The creators exaggerated the size of China and placed it in the middle of a world that otherwise consisted mainly of small off¬shore islands. A century earlier, the 1507 Waldseemuller map named and envisaged America as a separate continent for the first time. Photo of a genuine hand drawn world map, it was drawn in 1844 and therefore the countries are named as they were in that period. The biggest challenge is that it is impossible to portray the reality of the spherical world on a flat map. Perhaps to emphasise the independent existence of the Americas, the map shows what we now know is the Pacific lapping the western coast of South America, though its existence was only confirmed years late. In 2005, Google Earth presented a world in which the area of most concern to the used could be at the centre, and which - with mapped content overlaid - can contain whatever you think is important. Almost for the first time, the ability to create an accurate map has been placed in the hands of everyone, and it has transformed the way we view the world. But it comes at a price. There are few, if any, agreed standards about what should be included, and the less populated and 'less important' regions get ignored. The infant USSR was threatened with invasion, famine and social unrest. To counter this, brilliant designers such as Dimitri Moor were employed to create pro-Bolshevik propaganda. Using a map of European Russia and its neighbours, Moor's image of a heroic Bolshevik guard defeating the invading 'Whites' helped define the Soviet Union in the Russian popular imagination. Google Maps claims that it is on a 'never-ending quest for the perfect map', but Jerry Brotton, historian of cartography and the author of A History of the World in Twelve Maps, isn't so sure. A Mercator map created in 1569. In the Mercator projection, north America looks at least as big, if not slightly larger, than Africa. And Greenland also looks of comparable size. Today, billions of searches are made on Google Maps each day, helping people navigate their way around, streets, towns and countries. Google Maps claims that it is on a ‘never-ending quest for the perfect map’, but Jerry Brotton, historian of cartography and the author of A History of the World in Twelve Maps, isn’t so sure. He argues that all maps are of their time, their place and serve certain purposes. ‘No world map is, or can be, a definitive, transparent depiction of its subject that offers a disembodied eye onto the world,’ he writes. ‘Each one is a continual negotiation between its makers and users, as their understanding of the world changes.’ This map was used in 1782 by British diplomats negotiating an end to the American War of Independence in Paris. Richard Oswald, secretary to the delegation, annotated it with coloured lines to show where it was thought past treaties established the U.S./Canada border.","output":"This article highlights the distortions and inaccuracies of the Mercator projection, a map created in 1596, which is commonly seen in classrooms and textbooks. While the map accurately shows the shapes of land masses, it distorts their true size. For example, on the Mercator projection, North America appears larger than Africa, Alaska appears larger than Mexico, and Greenland appears larger than China. In reality, Africa is three times larger than North America, Mexico is larger than Alaska, and China is four times larger than Greenland. Due to the impossibility of depicting the true spherical world on flat maps, cartographers have sought alternatives. One of the most well-known alternatives is the Gall-Peters projection, created in 1974, which makes it easier to see the relative sizes of different places. However, it still has some flaws, such as making certain places appear horizontally stretched near the poles or vertically stretched near the Equator. Maps tend to exaggerate the size of wealthy northern countries, including North America and Europe, while diminishing the size of large and powerful Southern Hemisphere nations such as Africa and India. This distortion has led some to question the objectivity and reliability of maps in general. While satellite imagery and tools like Google Maps have improved our view of the world, the article argues that this hasn't necessarily corrected the flaws in traditional maps. Technological advances, as well as ideological assumptions, have changed the way we view the world, but have not eliminated the inherent challenges of representing a spherical planet on two-dimensional maps. In conclusion, maps are never perfect; they are always a negotiation between their creators and users, made using certain perspectives and ideologies.

Rose, an autodidact with a dominating presence, supervised his music and literature studies and engaged other tutors for languages, art and drama. From his earliest lessons, Percy developed a lifelong fascination with Nordic culture; writing late in life, he said that the Icelandic Saga of Grettir the Strong was \\"the strongest single artistic influence on my life\\". As well as showing precocious musical talents, he displayed considerable early gifts as an artist, to the extent that his tutors thought his future might lie in art rather than music. At the age of 10 he began studying piano under Louis Pabst, a German immigrant then considered to be Melbourne's leading piano teacher. Grainger's first known composition, \\"A Birthday Gift to Mother\\", is dated 1893. Pabst arranged Grainger's first public concert appearances, at Melbourne's Masonic Hall in July and September 1894. The boy played works by Bach, Beethoven, Schumann and Scarlatti, and was warmly complimented in the Melbourne press.After Pabst returned to Europe in the autumn of 1894, Grainger's new piano tutor, Adelaide Burkitt, arranged for his appearances at a series of concerts in October 1894, at Melbourne's Royal Exhibition Building. The size of this enormous venue horrified the young pianist; nevertheless, his performance delighted the Melbourne critics, who dubbed him \\"the flaxen-haired phenomenon who plays like a master\\". This public acclaim helped Rose to decide that her son should continue his studies at  the Hoch Conservatory in Frankfurt, Germany, an institution recommended by William Laver, head of piano studies at Melbourne's Conservatorium of music.

It 's a wonderful thing to look out from the top of a mountain and know that you just got there by your own sweat and energy . Question How was the narrator feeling the day after they were unable to move ? Possible answers: pick from the following. 1). They were exhausted from going back to the top of the mountain .. 2). None of the above choices .. 3). They were still sore but their range of movement had improved .. 4). They found themselves covered in sweat and full of energy .. The answer:","output":"3). They were still sore but their range of movement had improved. Based on the context provided, the narrator mentions being exhausted for the rest of the day when they came down from the mountain, and they couldn't move at all the next day. Although the exact feelings of the narrator are not explicitly mentioned for the day after they were unable to move, it can be inferred that they were still sore from the physical exertion, as their body needed time to recover from the mountain climbing adventure.  Likely, their range of movement had improved compared to the day before, as the body gradually recovers from physical exertion in most cases. This improvement of movement and gradual recovery from soreness would be a natural progression after such an intense activity. So, despite the absence of an explicit description of their feelings on that particular day, it can be reasonably inferred that the narrator was still sore but had made some progress in regaining their mobility."},{"instruction":"Q:Process:  - Rock begins as magma from a volcano - The magma cools - Crystals form and the magma become igneous rocks - The igneous rocks break down into sediment - Become sedimentary rocks - If subjected to heat and/or pressure from plate-tectonic activity the sedimentary rocks become metamorphic rock - The metamorphic rocks melt - Become magma again.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more magma cools happens, how will it affect more magma become igneous rocks.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation does have a direct effect on the process. If more magma cools, it will lead to an increase in the formation of igneous rocks. As a larger quantity of magma cools and solidifies, additional crystals will form, resulting in a greater number of igneous rocks being created. This increase in igneous rock formation can also have indirect effects on the later stages of the process, leading to more sedimentary and metamorphic rocks as well."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. How do you do this: How can I line a wooden box for a DIY dog pool?","output":"To line a wooden box for a DIY dog pool, follow these simple steps: 1. Measure the wooden box: Use a measuring tape to measure the length, width, and height of the wooden box. This will help you determine the right size of the liner you need. 2. Choose a liner: Pick a waterproof liner, such as a heavy-duty plastic sheet, pond liner, or a tarp, that is big enough to cover the entire box including the sides and add a little extra for overlapping at the edges. 3. Cut the liner: Spread the liner on a flat surface and use your measurements to cut it according to the wooden box's dimensions, adding a few extra inches on each side to cover the edges of the box. 4. Attach the liner: Place the liner inside the wooden box, making sure it covers the whole box including the sides. You may fold the corners of the liner to make it fit better. Use a stable adhesive, like waterproof tape or glue, to attach the liner to the inside edges of the box. This will help the liner stay in place when your dog is playing in the pool. 5. Fill the pool with water: Make sure the liner is secure, and then fill the dog pool with water. The water should not go above the edges of the liner. 6. Add some fun: Place some toys and floats in the pool for your dog to play with, and watch your furry friend enjoy splashing around! Remember, always supervise your dog when it's in the pool to make sure it's safe and having fun."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: What are the names of the people that Zeke catches up to?

Victoria drew a picture of a brave pirate, while Katrina painted a beautiful princess. At lunchtime, Victoria and Katrina sat together under the big shady tree in their school's playground. They opened their lunch boxes and found yummy sandwiches made by their moms. They happily munched on their food, talking about the things they learned that morning.

Budget cutbacks at the school jeopardize the continuation of its music program, which would result in its teacher, Marty Streb, being laid off.  Concerned for both his colleague and his students, Scott attempts to raise the 48,000 necessary to keep the music program alive.

When Scott arrives at Niko's apartment, he learns that Niko was a former mixed martial arts fighter.  While watching the UFC at Niko's apartment, Scott learns that the loser of a fight receives 10,000, which gives him the idea of raising the money by fighting and losing in MMA. Scott, helped by Niko and Marty, begins with small unsanctioned bouts paying only 750 to the loser.  Niko begins training him in defense, later adding trainer Mark to teach offense, after Scott knocks out an opponent and realizes that wins give larger payouts, needing fewer fights to achieve his 48,000 goal. While Mark trains with Scott, Malia De La Cruz, one of Scott's students and a band member, helps Niko study for his citizenship test by putting the information into songs.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - Christian democracy is a political ideology which emerged in nineteenth-century Europe under the influence of conservatism and Catholic social teaching, as well as Neo-Calvinism. It was originally conceived as a combination of traditional Catholic beliefs and modern democratic ideas, and it grew to incorporate the social teaching of other Christian denominations, such as the Lutheran Church and the Reformed Church. After World War II, the Protestant and Catholic movements of the Social Gospel and Neo-Thomism, respectively, played a role in shaping Christian democracy. Christian democracy continues to be influential in Europe and Latin America, although it is present in other parts of the world too.  - The Centrist Democrat International is Christian Democrat political international. Until 2001 it was known as the Christian Democrat International (CDI) and before that the \\"Christian Democrat and People's Parties International\\" (until 1999) (this earlier name is, since October 2000, still sometimes used colloquially). It was formed in 1961 in Santiago, Chile as the \\"Christian Democrat World Union\\", building on the legacy of other Christian Democrat internationals who tried to create a Christian-inspired third way alternative to the socialist internationals; in 1982 it was renamed for the first time Christian Democrat International. The name officially changed due to the participation of groups of various faiths. It is the global international political group dedicated to the promotion of Christian democracy. Although it gathers parties from around the globe, its members are drawn principally from Europe and Latin America. Some of them are also members of the International Democrat Union (IDU), although the CDI is closer to the political centre and more communitarian than the IDU.  - A European political party (formally, a political party at European level; informally a Europarty) is a type of political party organisation operating transnationally in Europe and in the institutions of the European Union. They are regulated and funded by the European Union and are usually made up of national parties, not individuals. Europarties have the exclusive right to campaign during the European elections and express themselves within the European Parliament by their affiliated political groups and their MEPs. Europarties, through coordination meetings with their affiliated heads of state and government, influence the decision-making process of the European Council. Europarties also work closely and co-ordinate with their affiliated members of the European Commission and, according to the Lisbon Treaty the Europarty that wins the European elections has the right to nominate to the European Council its candidate for President of the European Commission.  - The Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU) is a global inter-parliamentary institution established in 1889 by Frédéric Passy (France) and William Randal Cremer (United Kingdom). It was the first permanent forum for political multilateral negotiations. Initially, the organization was for individual parliamentarians, but has since transformed into an international organization of the parliaments of sovereign states. The national parliaments of 170 countries are members of the IPU, and 11 regional parliamentary assemblies are associate members. The IPU has permanent observer status at the United Nations General Assembly and general consultative status with the Economic and Social Council.  - Santiago de Chile is the capital and largest city of Chile. It is also the center of its largest conurbation. Santiago is located in the country's central valley, at an elevation of above mean sea level.  - The European People's Party (EPP) is a European political party. A transnational organisation, it is composed of other political parties, not individuals. Founded by primarily Christian democratic parties in 1976, it has since broadened its membership to include liberal-conservative parties and parties with other centre-right political perspectives.  - Lorenzo Cesa (born 16 August 1951 in Arcinazzo Romano, Rome) is an Italian politician, and was elected to the Italian Chamber of Deputies in the 2006 General election representing the Union of Christian and Centre Democrats. He was elected on October 27, 2005 as new party leader, replacing resigning secretary Marco Follini.  - The Union of the Centre ( Italian : Unione di Centro , UdC ) is a Christian democratic political party in Italy . Its secretary is Lorenzo Cesa , but its most popular figure and actual leader is Pier Ferdinando Casini . The party is a member of the European People 's Party and the Centrist Democrat International , of which Casini is president . The party was formed in December 2002 as the Union of Christian and Centre Democrats ( Unione dei Democratici Cristiani e di Centro , UDC ) as the merger of the Christian Democratic Centre , the United Christian Democrats and European Democracy . In 2008 the party was the driving force behind the UdC , an alliance comprising , among others , The Rose for Italy , the Populars for the Constituent Assembly of the Centre , the Liberal Clubs , the Party of Christian Democracy , Christian Democratic Party , Veneto for the European People 's Party , the Democratic Populars and the Autonomist Democrats . Since then , the party 's official name was neglected in favour of \`\` Union of the Centre '' and , since most of the UdC member parties have joined the UDC too , the UDC and the UdC started to overlap almost completely to the point that they are now undistinguishable . The UDC was part of the Pole / House of Freedoms from its establishment through 2008 . Later it has been affiliated neither to the centre - right nor the centre - left at the national level . Despite this , the party takes part in several regional , provincial and municipal governments with Forza Italia , the largest force of the Italian centre - right ( notably in Campania and Calabria ) , but recently formed alliances also with the centre - left Democratic Party in other regions ( notably in Marche ) and at the very local level . In the 2013 general election the UdC was part of With Monti for Italy , the coalition formed around Mario Monti 's Civic Choice .

If things went as planned, there was no limit to what she could have. She smiled to herself as a crowd of sunburned, middle-aged men broke ranks to let her pass on her way toward Mallory Square. They had no idea who she was, but she liked to think that they could sense her strength and that it intimidated them. Not enough to stop them from staring openly at her chest of course, but what did she expect? They were still men. Duval Street, Key West's main tourist drag, buzzed with early evening activity. The sun had set less than an hour ago, and the throngs moving up from the nightly sunset ritual in Mallory Square now wandered about, trying to choose between the dozens of bars and restaurants vying for their attention. She moved against the general flow and seemed to know exactly where she was going. She knew these streets well and had planned out her route ahead of time. But something bothered her. That nagging feeling in the back of her brain that she'd long ago learned to heed even though it was wrong as often as it was right. You couldn't survive in her world without learning to pay attention to such feelings, and she'd more than survived - she'd prospered beyond the dreams of any young hacker or con artist.

Question 1: Why in Japan is subway free Wi-Fi only for tourists? Question 2: Is free Wi-Fi really required in the whole of Delhi? Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","output":"No, Questions 1 and 2 are not asking the same thing. They are asking about different aspects of free Wi-Fi services in different locations. Let's analyze them separately and provide detailed answers for each. Question 1: Why in Japan is subway free Wi-Fi only for tourists? One possible reason for offering subway free Wi-Fi specifically to tourists in Japan might be to support and promote tourism in the country. By providing this service only for tourists, Japan wants to ensure that visitors to the country have a seamless and convenient experience while traveling on public transportation. Foreigners can access free Wi-Fi on the subway by entering their passports to register for the service. Tourists often rely on internet access to navigate, look up information about the area, and stay connected with friends, family, and work when they are traveling. Providing free Wi-Fi on subways allows Japan to cater to the needs of tourists who would appreciate these features. This can be seen as a way of welcoming and acknowledging the importance of international visitors to the country's economy. In addition, subway free Wi-Fi may incentivize more travelers to use public transportation, which could help in managing traffic congestion and environmental concerns. It is important to note that besides free Wi-Fi in subway stations for tourists, there are other free Wi-Fi options for residents in Japan, such as in cafes, libraries, and some public spaces. Question 2: Is free Wi-Fi really required in the whole of Delhi? Whether free Wi-Fi is required across the entire city of Delhi depends on various factors. Each city has its own set of unique circumstances, opportunities, and challenges. Implementing free Wi-Fi across the whole of Delhi could have multiple advantages and drawbacks that must be considered. Some of the potential advantages include: 1. Digital accessibility: Providing free Wi-Fi could help bridge the digital divide and improve access to information and resources for those who cannot afford an internet connection. 2. Economic growth: Easy access to the internet can contribute to the economy by facilitating business activities, attracting start-ups, and fostering innovation. 3. Quality of life: Free Wi-Fi in public spaces might encourage citizens to spend more time outdoors, promoting a sense of community and social engagement. 4. Educational opportunities: Students and researchers could benefit from increased access to online resources, which may improve learning outcomes. 5. Government services: Digitalization of various governmental services can be facilitated with the availability of free Wi-Fi, leading to increased efficiency and reduced corruption. However, there are also potential drawbacks or challenges associated with implementing free Wi-Fi across Delhi: 1. Costs: Investing in the infrastructure necessary to provide free and reliable Wi-Fi access can be expensive for the government. 2. Privacy and security concerns: Public Wi-Fi networks may expose users to privacy and security risks, such as identity theft, data breaches, or hacking. 3. Maintenance and management: Ensuring consistent quality, connectivity, and coverage can be challenging, particularly in densely populated areas or during peak usage hours. 4. Digital addiction: Proliferation of free Wi-Fi may exacerbate issues related to digital addiction and an imbalanced work-life balance. 5. Sustainability: Expanding Wi-Fi coverage might increase energy consumption, posing concerns about sustainability and environmental impact. In conclusion, whether free Wi-Fi is required in the whole of Delhi depends on weighing the potential benefits against the challenges and costs. It is a decision that must factor in the city's specific needs, budget limitations, infrastructure capabilities, and social and environmental priorities."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the fact that:  The voice becomes deeper as the larynx in the throat grows larger.  Answer the question:   Eric underwent surgery to increase the size of his larynx. His voice is now higher or deeper? The answer to this question is:","output":"Eric's voice is now deeper. The larynx, also known as the voice box, is an organ in the throat responsible for vocal production. The size and shape of the larynx determine many qualities of the voice that it produces. One fundamental principle is that a larger larynx produces a deeper voice, while a smaller larynx produces a higher voice. This principle is reflective of the way physical properties contribute to the generation of sound. In general, larger objects or spaces tend to resonate at lower frequencies, creating deeper sounds, while smaller objects or spaces resonate at higher frequencies, creating higher sounds. This is true for musical instruments, rooms in a building, geological features like canyons or caves, and also biological structures like the larynx. The vocal cords, housed within the larynx, are a pair of flexible muscular structures that vibrate to produce sound when air passes over them. Their length, tension, and mass can all affect the pitch of the sound they produce. A larger larynx typically accommodates longer, thicker vocal cords that vibrate at a lower frequency, resulting in a deeper voice. On the basis of the given information that Eric underwent surgery to increase the size of his larynx, it is reasonable to infer that his voice is now deeper. This is because the larger larynx, most likely housing larger vocal cords, would produce lower-frequency, deeper vocal sounds. However, it's important to note that this conclusion is genuinely indicative and while generally true, individual differences and surgical factors might influence the final outcome. Hence, for a comprehensive and concrete understanding of Eric's voice change, specific details of his surgical procedure and individual physiological differences would need to be taken into consideration."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

SEOUL South Korea's military on Monday threatened retaliation against North Korea after accusing the North of planting land mines inside the Demilitarised Zone border that wounded two soldiers last week, in what it called a cowardly act of provocation.      There was evidence to conclude that soldiers from the North crossed the Military Demarcation Line recently to plant the mines, and Pyongyang would be made to \\"pay a severe price\\", the South's military told a news briefing.      \\"We strongly condemn this cowardly act, which would be unthinkable for a normal military,\\" Major General Ku Hong-mo of South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said, calling it a violation of the armistice agreement that ended the 1950-53 Korean War.      The denunciation is likely to provoke an angry response from the North and further raise tensions on the Korean peninsula.      Later on Monday, as part of its countermeasures, the South Korean military used loudspeakers to blare anti-Pyongyang rhetoric across the border, a defense ministry official said, resuming broadcasts that had been suspended since 2004.      The United Nations Command, headed by the U.S. military and which oversees the armistice, also condemned what it called the North's violation of the truce. It said it would call for a meeting with North Korea's military.      The area around last Tuesday's blast had been swept for mines and the terrain made it impossible for mines planted elsewhere to have drifted due to rain or shifting soil, South Korea's military said.      Fragments from the exploded mines also had paint typically used by the North, it said.      Two soldiers who were part of a team conducting a routine search operation inside the heavily fortified DMZ near the town of Paju, about 50 km (30 miles) north of Seoul, were seriously wounded in the blast.      (Reporting by Ju-min Park; Editing by Jack Kim and Clarence Fernandez) ||||| Seoul, South Korea (CNN) South Korea says it will resume broadcasting propaganda messages over its heavily armed border with North Korea in retaliation for landmine blasts that wounded two of its soldiers.      The use of loudspeakers to blare government messages into North Korean territory is a form of psychological warfare that the South Korean Defense Ministry stopped more than a decade ago during a thaw in relations between the two sides.      Restarting the broadcasts is all but certain to infuriate North Korea, which has threatened in the past to destroy the groups of huge speakers that the South set up at the demilitarized zone that separates the two countries.      But the South Korean government is upset over the serious leg injuries suffered by two soldiers who stepped on landmines last week in the demilitarized zone, which is considered to be the most heavily fortified border in the world.      South Korea and the U.S.-led United Nations Command in Korea said Monday that the North Korean military planted the mines in the southern half of the zone along a route patrolled by South Korean troops.      Wounded soldiers forced to have amputations      One of the soldiers had to have part of each leg amputated, and the other had to have one foot removed at the ankle, the South Korean Defense Ministry said.      Before South Korea announced the resumption of propaganda broadcasts, Maj. Gen. Koo Hong-mo, director of operations of the South's Joint Chiefs of Staff, warned that North Korea would \\"pay a harsh price\\" for laying the mines. He demanded that Pyongyang apologize for planting the landmines and severely punish whoever is responsible.      There was no immediate comment on the matter Monday in North Korean state media.      The South Korean Defense Ministry declined to specify when exactly the propaganda broadcasts would resume. It said sound from the the giant loudspeakers can travel about 24 kilometers (15 miles) at night and about 12 kilometers on weekdays.      Professor Lee Jung-hoon said we have not heard the end of the tensions.      \\"When we have the psychological warfare -- the leaflets or the loudspeakers -- basically the message is: the current leader is doing a very bad job, that their human rights are being violated, and that there's a much better world outside that they should be aware of,\\" said Lee, an associate professor of international relations at Yonsei University in Seoul.      He said North Korea will not take kindly to criticism against Kim.      \\"For them Kim Jong Un, as his father and his father's father was, is not just a political leader, he's a deity figure,\\" he said. \\"For the leadership, just the fact that there's the public condemnation and criticism of this godlike figure is just totally unacceptable.\\"      And North Korea, he said, will have some sort of reaction.      \\"Absolutely they will respond,\\" he said. \\"I can't say in what way.\\"      U.N. Command condemns truce violations      The U.S.-led United Nations Command in Korea said that its investigation into the explosions found that the North's Korean People's Army had breached several parts of the armistice on the Korean Peninsula by planting landmines along a South Korean patrol route in the southern half of the demilitarized zone.      \\"The United Nations Command condemns these violations of the Armistice Agreement, and will call for a general officer level-dialog with the Korean People's Army,\\" the U.N. Command statement said.      The U.N. Command, which monitors the armistice, said that the investigation had found that the wooden box landmines were recently planted, ruling out the possibility that they were old mines that might have been displaced by rain or other elements over the years.      Staff members from South Korea, the United States, New Zealand and Colombia took part in the investigation, the U.N. Command said.      Previous border tensions      The demilitarized zone has divided North and South Korea since the Korean War ended in 1953 with an armistice rather than a formal peace treaty. As a result, the two countries technically remain at war.      Tension has flared in the past around sensitive points on the their de facto border, including North Korea's shelling of an island in 2010 that killed two South Korean marines.      Roughly 28,000 U.S. troops are based in South Korea. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"South Korea's military has accused North Korea of planting landmines inside the Demilitarised Zone border that wounded two South Korean soldiers last week.

(AP) -- Lauren Panos was surprised when she walked into her ninth-grade English class in the fall and saw there were no boys. Her parents had not told her they had enrolled her in a new all-girls class at Arrowhead High School in Hartland. Panos still isn't sold on the idea. \\"All the girls there, they can talk out of turn,\\" the 14-year-old said. \\"We are bored of tasks and it's really upsetting.\\" More public school systems are looking at separating boys and girls, whether for certain classes or by total schools, after the federal government opened the door last fall. Supporters say separating students by sex helps them learn better and allows boys and girls to explore subjects they may not otherwise take. \\"Boys just make a bigger trouble in the class,\\" Panos' classmate, Alyson Douglas, 15, said \\"I likes not worrying about boys causing  _ .\\" Presently, nationwide, at least 253 public schools offer single-sex classes and 51 schools are entirely single sex, according to the National Association for Single Sex Public Education. In1995, just three public schools offered single-sex classes. Critics of same-sex classrooms argue that proven methods of improving education should be carried out instead of one that divides boys and girls.  \\"Too many schools feel they can carry out a social experiment with students' education with really the weakest of theories,\\" said Emily Martin, deputy director of the American Civil Liberties Union's Women's Rights Project. Single-sex schools are an \\"illusionary  silver bullet,\\" said Lisa Maatz, director of public policy and government relations for the American Association of University Women.

Select the correct sentiment of the following review: Love it or loathe it, it's hard to not find Warren Beatty's take on \\"Dick Tracy,\\" the 1990 film adaptation of Chester Gould's famous comic strip, anything short of a genre classic. Superhero films have been coming out of the woodwork in recent years, and may soon become a genre all on its own. Beatty's film liberally uses Gould's source material to full effect, shooting in all six of the strip's primary colors, and thus giving this unique yet familiar world of trigger-happy mutant gangsters and loose, seductive women a lush visual style and tone. It can be stated that the film's strong visual aesthetics drastically short-change the characters and their acting abilities, which I don't think can be any further from the truth. \\"Dick Tracy\\" relishes in its look and ghastly characters, and Beatty himself, who plays the dogged and incorruptible detective of the title, is appropriately stoic and ready to bust the bad guys at any and all costs. Other than the visual treats and Oscar-winning makeup, there is a plot, and Big Boy Caprice (Al Pacino, deliciously over-the-top in an Oscar-nominated performance), seeks to eliminate Tracy in one well-planned move, but also seeks to gain control of all criminal action in the city by uniting all the feuding gangs under him. Tracy, meanwhile, is juggling his relationship with Tess Trueheart (Glenne Headly), who as her name would have it, remains faithfully by his side and cares for The Kid (Charlie Korsmo), who eventually finds a father figure to look up to in our crime-busting hero. Tracy's fidelity to Tess is tested by the tempting advances of Breathless Mahoney (Madonna), who is also Big Boy's main squeeze. At the same time that all of this is going down, things become heated when a new criminal figure arrives in town, and decides to play both sides against the middle. The performances are good, as Beatty's focus on the strained and romantic relationships between each of the leads becomes the center of the material, as opposed to just concentrating on pointless action and special effects. Pacino freely chews up the scenery in a role that's truly standout from the rest. \\"Dick Tracy\\" is one of the best and most overlooked of the comic book movie genre.

Obama also used his power under the 1906 Antiquities Act to protect two swaths of land under the Bureau of Land Management’s control: Washington’s San Juan Islands and New Mexico’s Rio Grande del Norte.      “These sites honor the pioneering heroes, spectacular landscapes and rich history that have shaped our extraordinary country,” the president said. “By designating these national monuments today, we will ensure they will continue to inspire and be enjoyed by generations of Americans to come.”      House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Doc Hastings (R-Wash.), who has opposed the creation of new wilderness areas and national parks, questioned why the president would extend public lands protection at a time when the federal budget is under pressure.      “The Obama Administration not only sees the sequester as an opportunity to make automatic spending reductions as painful as possible on the American people,\\" Hastings said in a statement, \\"it’s also a good time for the President to dictate under a century-old law that the government spend money it doesn’t have on property it doesn’t even own.\\"      But Conservation Fund president Lawrence A. Selzer, whose group donated land to help create both the Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad National Monument and Delaware's First State National Monument, said nearly half of the nation's national parks started out as national monument designations. In the case of Delaware, the state's Mt. Cuba Center gave 20 million to the Fund so it could purchase the 1,100-acre property Woodlawn in Delaware and Pennsylvania and donate it to the National Park Service.      \\"This is by no means unusual,\\" Selzer said. \\"The fact that the president is stepping forward and using his authority is a reflection of the support at the local level.\\"            It remains unclear whether Obama will designate other national monuments in the future; last Congress marked the first one since 1966 which failed to designate a single new national park or wilderness areas. Even the three national moments Obama has designated on Park Service land will not become national parks without an act of Congress.      White House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters Monday that \\"in terms of future decisions along these lines, I don't have anything to announce at this point.\\"      He did challenge Hastings' suggestion that these new monuments would put a financial burden on taxpayers, noting that local communities often benefit from tourism once an areas has been designated. \\"And in terms of the immediate costs -- in terms of the management of the land, I think they're pretty minimal in the early stages,\\" he said.      Mike Matz, who heads the Pew Charitable Trusts' Campaign for America's Wilderness, said there are several other large landscapes that enjoy significant local and bipartisan support. These include Idaho's Boulder-White Clouds proposed wilderness area and Cedar Mesa plateau in Utah.      Since the Rio Grande del Norte is the only large wild area Obama has declared a national monument so far, Matz said, \\"We would like to see him do more on that scale.\\"      Republicans may try to repeal the Antiquities Act, though it is unclear whether they would succeed. Sen. David Vitter (R-La.) offered an amendment revoking the president's authority last week as part of the budget debate, but it didn't come up for a vote. ||||| Today, President Obama signed proclamations establishing five new national monuments that celebrate our nation’s rich history and natural heritage. The monuments, located in Delaware, Maryland, New Mexico, Ohio and Washington, help tell the story of significant people and extraordinary events in American history, and also help protect natural resources and supporting economic growth in local communities through tourism and outdoor recreation.      “These sites honor the pioneering heroes, spectacular landscapes and rich history that have shaped our extraordinary country,” President Obama said. “By designating these national monuments today, we will ensure they will continue to inspire and be enjoyed by generations of Americans to come.”      Check out images from each of the new monuments above, and read on below to find out more about these unique sites.      Charles Young Buffalo Soldiers National Monument in Ohio. The monument will preserve the home of Col. Charles Young (1864–1922), a distinguished officer in the United States Army who was the third African American to graduate from West Point and the first to achieve the rank of Colonel. Young also served as one of the early Army superintendents of Sequoia and General Grant National Parks, before the establishment of the National Park Service in 1916. The national headquarters of the Omega Psi Phi fraternity, of which Col. Young was a member, made the property available for acquisition by the federal government for the purpose of establishing the national monument commemorating Young’s life and accomplishments. The monument, located in Wilberforce, Ohio, will be managed by the Department of the Interior’s National Park Service.      First State National Monument in Delaware. The monument will tell the story of the early Dutch, Swedish, Finnish and English settlement of the colony of Delaware, as well as Delaware’s role as the first state to ratify the Constitution. The park is comprised of three historic areas related to Delaware’s rich history: the Dover Green, the New Castle Court House complex (including the courthouse, Green and Sheriff’s House), and the Woodlawn property in the Brandywine Valley. The monument will be managed by the Department of the Interior’s National Park Service.      Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad National Monument in Maryland. The monument commemorates the life of the most famous conductor on the Underground Railroad who was responsible for helping enslaved people escape from bondage to freedom. The new national park, located on Maryland’s Eastern Shore, includes large sections of landscapes that are significant to Tubman’s early life in Dorchester County and evocative of her life as a slave and conductor of the Underground Railroad. The park includes Stewart’s Canal, dug by hand by free and enslaved people between 1810 and the 1830s and where Tubman learned important outdoor skills when she worked in the nearby timbering operations with her father. Lands that are part of Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge, although part of the new national monument, will continue to be managed by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad National Monument also includes the home site of Jacob Jackson, a free black man who used coded letters to help Tubman communicate with family and others. The monument will also partner with the State of Maryland’s Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad State Park Visitor Center when it opens in 2015. The monument will be managed by the Department of the Interior’s National Park Service.      Río Grande del Norte National Monument in New Mexico. Located northwest of Taos, the Río Grande del Norte contains stretches of the Río Grande Gorge and extinct volcanoes that rise from the Taos Plateau. The area is known for its spectacular landscapes and recreational opportunities – like rafting, fishing and hiking – and serves as important habitat for many birds and wildlife. The monument is also home to a dense collection of petroglyphs and extraordinary archaeological and cultural resources dating from the Archaic Period to the more recent passage of Hispanic settlers. The monument will be managed by the Department of the Interior’s Bureau of Land Management, which currently manages the more than 240,000 acres of the monument.      San Juan Islands National Monument in Washington. Home to bald eagles, orca whales, harbor seals and other rare species, the San Juan Islands is a chain of 450 islands, rocks and pinnacles. Located in Washington State’s Puget Sound, the archipelago provides an opportunity for visitors, campers, kayakers and birdwatchers to experience the natural beauty of the undeveloped, rugged landscape. A number of historic lighthouses are located on the islands, as well as cultural resources and fossils dating back 12,000 years. The monument will be managed by the Department of the Interior’s Bureau of Land Management. ||||| What is a summary?","output":"In 2013, President Obama used his executive authority to designate five new national monuments in an effort to preserve historic sites and landscapes and protect them from development. These monuments include areas managed by the National Park Service, such as the Harriet Tubman Underground Railroad in Maryland and a collection of sites commemorating Delaware as the nation's first state. Additionally, the Antiquities Act of 1906 meant that President Obama could protect land under the Bureau of Land Management’s control, such as in Washington’s San Juan Islands and New Mexico’s Rio Grande del Norte. The move was met with some criticism due to financial pressures, but others argue that many national parks began as national monument designations, and the local tourism and outdoor recreation benefits from these protections."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: Who share a motel room in South Dakota? , can you please find it?   In Billings, Montana, a police officer arrives and discovers Woody Grant walking on the shoulder of the roadway. Woody is picked up by his son David, who learns that Woody wants to go to Lincoln, Nebraska, to collect a million dollar sweepstakes prize he believes he has won. When David sees the sweepstakes letter, he knows immediately that it is a mail scam designed to get gullible people to purchase magazine subscriptions. David brings his father home, where his mother Kate becomes increasingly annoyed by Woody's insistence on collecting the money. After Woody is picked up again trying to get to Nebraska, David and his brother Ross discuss putting Woody in a retirement home. David pays a visit with his ex-girlfriend, Noel, who returns his belongings and refuses to move back in with him. Their conversation is cut short by a call from Kate reporting that Woody has taken off once again. David retrieves Woody and decides to drive him all the way to Lincoln, much to Kate's dismay. While in Rapid City, South Dakota, Woody goes on a bender and hits his head while stumbling back to their motel room. David takes him to the hospital to get his head stitched up. David learns that they will be passing through Woody's hometown of Hawthorne, Nebraska, and suggests they spend the night with Woody's family. Woody is against the idea, but they end up going anyway. They stay with Woody's brother Ray, his wife, and their two sons, Cole and Bart. Woody and David visit a mechanic shop Woody once co-owned, followed by some beers at a bar. When David brings up Woody's alcoholism and problems within the family—with Woody implying that he did not love Kate nor really want children—they get into an argument. At another bar, they meet Ed Pegram, whom the family blames for stealing Woody's air compressor decades ago. Over David's objections, Woody mentions winning the money and the barflies toast his good fortune. The next day, they learn that the news has spread through the town like wildfire.

Dr. Donald Blake, a science professor at Dunsford University, receives delivery of a coelacanth. A student, Jimmy, asks Blake if the fish is really a million years old. Blake replies, \\"It's the species that's old. No change in millions of years. See, the coelacanth is a living fossil, immune to the forces of evolution\\". Blake lectures his students about evolution and devolution, telling them that man is the only creature that can decide whether to move forwards or backwards, and that \\"unless we learn to control the instincts we've inherited from our ape-like ancestors, the race is doomed\\". Inside the lab, Blake scratches himself on its teeth of the Partially-thawed coelacanth, accidentally sticking his bloody hand into the water-filled container which held the fish. Molly Riordan, assistant to Dr. Cole Oliver, is with Blake and offers him a ride home. When they get to Molly's car, Blake says he doesn't feel well and passes out.

Plot title: The Piano Teacher Movie plot: Erika Kohut is a piano professor at a Vienna music conservatory. Although already in her forties, she still lives in an apartment with her domineering mother. Her father is a long-standing resident in a psychiatric asylum. The audience is gradually shown truths about Erika's private life. Behind her assured faÃ§ade, she is a woman whose sexual repression is manifested in a long list of paraphilia, including (but by no means limited to) voyeurism and sadomasochistic fetishes such as sexual self-mutilation. When Erika meets Walter Klemmer, a charming 17-year-old engineering student from a middle class background, a mutual obsession develops. Even though she initially attempts to prevent consistent contact and even tries to undermine his application to the conservatory, he eventually becomes her pupil. Like her, he appreciates and is a gifted interpreter of Schumann and Schubert. Erika destroys the musical prospects of an insecure but talented girl, Anna Schober, driven by her jealousy of the girl's contact with Walterâand also, perhaps, by her fears that Anna's life will mirror her own. She does so by hiding shards of glass inside one of Anna's coat pockets, damaging her right hand and ruining her aspirations to play at the forthcoming jubilee concert. Erika then pretends to be sympathetic when Anna's mother asks for advice on her daughter's recuperation. (The sub-plot of the pupil and her mother, mirroring the main relationship in the film, is absent in Jelinek's novel.) In a moment of dramatic irony, the girl's mother rhetorically asks Erika who could do something so evil. Walter pursues Erika into a lavatory immediately after she has secretly ruined her pupil's hand. Walter passionately kisses Erika even though she is rebuffing him. Erika finally responds to his passion, but insists on repeatedly controlling, humiliating and frustrating Walter. Walter is increasingly insistent in his desire to start a sexual relationship with Erika, but Erika is only willing if he will satisfy her masochistic fantasies,...

Q:Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Alexis Pilkington was a popular 17-year-old and a well-liked athlete who had already won a soccer scholarship to college. But none of that stopped Alexis from becoming the target of online bullying  . Alexis began to receive hundreds of online unpleasant comments via the latest social networking site called www.formspring.com. In March 2010, Alexis committed suicide and although all agreed that the online bother was not the single factor that led to Alexis' death, everyone did agree that it was a contributory factor. Unfortunately, Alexis' story is not unique. A 2010 study conducted by the Cyberbullying Research Center showed that cyberbullying victims were almost twice as likely to have attempted suicide compared to youth who had not experienced cyberbullying. Suicide is obviously the extreme and no one can minimize the tragedy of it. However, there are other damages that occur as a result of aggressive bullying. It can damage self-esteem and lead to feelings of worthlessness, and also increase social isolation and make victims become withdrawn, depressed, anxious, and insecure. So what causes girls to be so unkind towards each other? A term known as relational aggression may best describe the cause of girl-on-girl bullying. It starts with a clique   usually led by a girl with a high level of social status and popularity. In order not to lose her position, she will control girls within the clique and take action if she feels threatened. At the leader's directive the girls within the clique will spread rumors and lies and annoy other girls continuously. The bullying starts at school but will quickly go to cyberbullying due to anonymity  . Girls will easily do so in the anonymity of the Internet. Ultimately the cause will be summarized as the insecurity and jealousy of one girl and the twisted loyalty of members within her clique. Underneath the confident exterior   of a female bully lie desperate insecurities. A:","output":"What was a significant factor contributing to Alexis Pilkington's suicide according to the article?

A right-handed batsman known for his back foot strokeplay, O'Neill made his state debut aged 18, before progressing to Test selection aged 21 in late 1958. Early in his career, O'Neill was one of the foremost batsmen in the Australian team, scoring three Test centuries and topping the run scoring aggregates on a 1959-60 tour of the Indian subcontinent which helped Australia win its last Test and series on Pakistani soil for 39 years, as well as another series in India. His career peaked in 1960-61 when he scored 181 in the Tied Test against the West Indies, and at the end of the series, had a career average of 58.25. Identified as a future Test prospect, he was selected in a Western Australia Combined XI for a match against the touring England cricket team at the start of the 1958-59 season in Perth. Prior to the match, O'Neill was hounded by the media. The tourists decided to test him with short-pitched bowling, especially Fred Trueman. O'Neill decided to abstain from hooking, while attacking the spin of Jim Laker with a series of sweep shots. After four and a half hours of uncharacteristic restraint, he compiled 104 with an emphasis on off side play. He took a total of 2/67, removing Fred Trueman and Arthur Milton.  He scored 85 against Western Australia and then made 84 not out for New South Wales against England. He was selected for an Australian XI, which played the tourists in a dress rehearsal before the Tests. He made one and two as Australia were crushed by 345 runs.  Nevertheless, O'Neill was selected to make his debut in the five-Test series against England, playing in all of the matches. The First Test in Brisbane was a low scoring match described by Australian captain Richie Benaud as producing \\"some of the slowest and worst cricket imaginable\\", O'Neill made 34 in Australia's first innings of 186 to help secure a lead of 52. He then top-scored with an unbeaten 71 in the second innings, guiding Australia to an eight-wicket victory. O'Neill scored 71 of the last 89 runs scored while he was at the crease, refusing to be dried up by the England's usage of leg theory. It enlivened a match plagued by time-wasting, and best remembered for a depressingly slow innings by England's Trevor Bailey, who scored 68 from 426 balls in seven and a half hours. England captain Peter May described O'Neill's innings as \\"sparkling\\" and said that it made \\"everything which had gone before look even more wretched\\". Retired English player Ian Peebles, writing in the Sunday Times, said \\"Although O'Neill is in the very early stages of his career, it is already something of an occasion when he comes to the wicket, and one can sense the expectancy of the crowd and the heightened tension of the opposition\\". Wisden opined that O'Neill had \\"saved a game that had been tortuous for days\\". For his part, O'Neill said that the dour play was \\"unbelievable\\" and that he was \\"just about falling to sleep\\" in the field.  He struck 77 in the rain-affected drawn Third Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground and followed this with 56 in the Fourth Test in Adelaide. Despite making a duck in the Fifth Test, he ended the series as the second highest runscorer with 282 at 56.40 as Australia took the series 4-0. He bowled two overs without success. Outside the Tests, O'Neill scored 155 and 128 against Victoria and Western Australia respectively as New South Wales completed their sixth successive Sheffield Shield win. Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Was he successful against England?","output":"Yes, Norman O'Neill was successful against England.

Question: Information:  - The pond slider (\\"Trachemys scripta\\") is a common, medium-sized semi-aquatic turtle. There are three subspecies of sliders. The most recognizable subspecies is the red-eared slider (\\"T. s. elegans\\"), which is popular in the pet trade and has been introduced to other parts of the world by people releasing it to the wild. Baby and juvenile pond sliders have a green shell (carapace) and yellow green skin with dark green striped markings. Markings and colors fade in adults to a muted olive green to brown or orange carapace. Some individuals become almost black with few visible markings. The carapace is oval and flattened for females, round and complex for males. The underside of the shell is yellow with dark markings in the center of each scute, making it easier to determine their sex. However, the markings underside the shell fade as the turtle age.  - A carapace is a dorsal (upper) section of the exoskeleton or shell in a number of animal groups, including arthropods, such as crustaceans and arachnids, as well as vertebrates, such as turtles and tortoises. In turtles and tortoises, the underside is called the plastron.  - Organisms of many species are specialized into male and female varieties, each known as a sex, with some falling in between being intersex. Sexual reproduction involves the combining and mixing of genetic traits: specialized cells known as gametes combine to form offspring that inherit traits from each parent. Gametes can be identical in form and function (known as isogamy), but in many cases an asymmetry has evolved such that two sex-specific types of gametes (heterogametes) exist (known as anisogamy).  - The red-eared slider (\\"Trachemys scripta elegans\\"), also known as the red-eared terrapin, is a semiaquatic turtle belonging to the family Emydidae. It is a subspecies of the pond slider. It is the most popular pet turtle in the United States and is also popular as a pet in the rest of the world. It has, therefore, become the most commonly traded turtle in the world. It is native to the southern United States and northern Mexico, but has become established in other places because of pet releases, and has become an invasive species in many areas, where it outcompetes native species. The red-eared slider is included in the list of the world's 100 most invasive species published by the IUCN.  - Puerto Rico, (Spanish for \\"Rich Port\\") officially the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico (\\"Free Associated State of Puerto Rico\\") and briefly called Porto Rico, is an unincorporated territory of the United States located in the northeast Caribbean Sea.  - The Puerto Rican slider ( Trachemys stejnegeri stejnegeri ) is found mainly in Puerto Rico and surrounding areas . It is a relative of the pond slider .  - Bean is a common name for large seeds of several genera of the flowering plant family Fabaceae (also known as Leguminosae) which are used for human or animal food.

Does \\"Thus, in classical western philosophy the gender of this one-and-only deity is most likely to be an analogical statement of how humans and God address, and relate to, each other.\\" contain the correct answer to \\"In what ways can the gender of God be viewed?\\"","output":"This statement does provide one perspective on the question of God's gender in the context of classical western philosophy. However, to provide a detailed and long answer, we should explore in-depth the various ways in which the gender of God has been viewed and debated among theologians, philosophers, and the general populace. 1. Anthropomorphic perspective: In many religious texts, including the Bible and the Qur'an, God is often described using anthropomorphic language, assigning human-like attributes such as gender, emotions, and actions. In these texts, God is frequently referred to using masculine pronouns and titles, such as \\"Father\\" and \\"Lord\\". However, this portrayal may be more a reflection of the patriarchal societies in which these texts arose, and not a definitive statement on the actual gender of God. 2. Feminist perspective: Feminist theologians have challenged the traditional masculine representation of God and called for more inclusive language, as well as exploring the historical and cultural reasons for the predominance of male imagery in religious texts. They argue that presenting God as male can lead to a belief that men are considered superior or more divine than women. The feminist perspective seeks to highlight the feminine aspects of the divine, such as the concept of wisdom in ancient philosophy (Sophia in Greek) and the many female deities found in ancient religions. 3. Gender-neutral perspective: Some thinkers advocate for recognizing God as a gender-neutral or androgynous divinity, transcending gender roles and human understanding of binaries. In this view, God can be understood as encompassing and transcending the full range of human characteristics, incorporating masculine, feminine, and gender-neutral aspects. This can be supported by scriptures that describe God as beyond human conception or categorization. 4. Metaphorical perspective: Some philosophers argue that applying human concepts of gender to God is inherently limiting and not theologically necessary. Instead, they suggest that the language used to describe God in religious texts should be seen as metaphorical or symbolic, emphasizing the deeper truth about the nature of God and the divine-human relationship rather than making literal assertions about God's gender. This would align with the quote in question, suggesting that the gender of God may be \\"an analogical statement of how humans and God address, and relate to, each other.\\" 5. Pantheon perspective: In polytheistic traditions, such as ancient Greek and Roman religions, the gender of individual gods and goddesses is often clearly defined, representing various aspects of nature, human experiences, and society. In these religions, the division of divine attributes between male and female deities does not imply a strict gender hierarchy but rather serves as a reflection of human culture and the forces at work in life. 6. Personal perspective: Finally, it is worth noting that people's experiences, sentiments, and preferences may shape their individual views on the gender of God. Some believers may feel more connected to a feminine image of the divine or more inclined to address God in gender-neutral terms. In this sense, the gender of God, and the way we talk or think about it, can be deeply personal and subjective. In conclusion, the gender of God can be viewed from multiple angles, ranging from traditional anthropomorphic portrayals, feminist reinterpretation, and gender-neutral advocacy, to metaphorical understanding, polytheistic diversity, and personal preference. Nevertheless, it is essential to recognize that our understanding of the divine is contingent on human imagination and language, and any discussion of God's gender should be approached with nuance, humility, and openness to differing perspectives."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The hypothesis, \\"The dirt biker falls off the ramp,\\" is connected to the premise as it deals with the same subject (the dirt biker and the ramp) but explores the potential outcome of the dirt biker's actions. To determine if the premise tells us whether the hypothesis is true, we need to analyze if the information provided in the premise is enough to establish a clear connection or if it leads us to conclude the hypothesis. The premise states that the dirt biker successfully lands on a ramp, which indicates that they have reached the ramp's surface, but it does not provide further details on what happens afterward. For instance, we don't know if the biker maintains control after landing, if they successfully navigate the ramp, or if any external factors like terrain, weather, or crowd distractions could affect their performance. The hypothesis, on the other hand, presents an undesirable outcome, which is the dirt biker falling off the ramp. This hypothesis is plausible because various factors could cause the dirt biker to fall off the ramp, such as losing balance or control, improper landing, equipment malfunction, or other circumstances. However, based on the given premise, we do not have enough evidence or context to support or refute the hypothesis. Therefore, the premise does not tell us whether the hypothesis is true.

Read this: Until recently, in the absence of prior agreement on a clear and precise definition, the concept was thought to mean (as a shorthand) 'a division of sovereignty between two levels of government'. New research, however, argues that this cannot be correct, as dividing sovereignty - when this concept is properly understood in its core meaning of the final and absolute source of political authority in a political community - is not possible. The descent of the United States into Civil War in the mid-nineteenth century, over disputes about unallocated competences concerning slavery and ultimately the right of secession, showed this. One or other level of government could be sovereign to decide such matters, but not both simultaneously. Therefore, it is now suggested that federalism is more appropriately conceived as 'a division of the powers flowing from sovereignty between two levels of government'. What differentiates the concept from other multi-level political forms is the characteristic of equality of standing between the two levels of government established. This clarified definition opens the way to identifying two distinct federal forms, where before only one was known, based upon whether sovereignty resides in the whole (in one people) or in the parts (in many peoples): the federal state (or federation) and the federal union of states (or federal union), respectively. Leading examples of the federal state include the United States, Germany, Canada, Switzerland, Australia and India. The leading example of the federal union of states is the European Union.

Question: what is the second to last product mentioned? Context: In 1931, RCA Victor introduced their vinyl-based Victrolac compound as a material for some unusual-format and special-purpose records. By the end of the 1930s vinyl's advantages of light weight, relative unbreakability and low surface noise had made it the material of choice for prerecorded radio programming and other critical applications. When it came to ordinary 78 rpm records, however, the much higher cost of the raw material, as well as its vulnerability to the heavy pickups and crudely mass-produced steel needles still commonly used in home record players, made its general substitution for shellac impractical at that time. During the Second World War, the United States Armed Forces produced thousands of 12-inch vinyl 78 rpm V-Discs for use by the troops overseas. After the war, the wider use of vinyl became more practical as new record players with relatively lightweight crystal pickups and precision-ground styli made of sapphire or an exotic osmium alloy proliferated. In late 1945, RCA Victor began offering special transparent red vinyl De Luxe pressings of some classical 78s, at a de luxe price. Later, Decca Records introduced vinyl Deccalite 78s, while other record companies came up with vinyl concoctions such as Metrolite, Merco Plastic and Sav-o-flex, but these were mainly used to produce \\"unbreakable\\" children's records and special thin vinyl DJ pressings for shipment to radio stations.

Harriette M. Hoyt, of Sayre, was charged with felony attempted second-degree murder, according to the Elmira Police Department. She put her daughter in a white plastic bag and abandoned her near bushes in the back yard of a residence in the 600 block of Walnut Street, court records state.      The infant girl, who was at an out-of-town hospital Tuesday, was discovered about 1 p.m. Tuesday by neighbors who heard what sounded like a cat crying outside a residence in the 600 block of Walnut Street, according to media partner WENY-TV.

After taking her out of the bag, they called the police and cleaned her up.      The infant was transported to a local hospital for evaluation and treatment. Although she was in stable condition, she was transported to another out-of-town hospital for further evaluation.

Question: Joe found that shopping  was dangerous for him.  Even though he had a great job, or maybe because of it, he found himself doing this a great deal. There were always funds left over, but not enough for his taste.  What was he doing when he was shopping?  Choices:  - overspending - loss of money - run out of money - spending money - deficit  The rationale to choose \\"overspending\\" as the answer is that: The answer to this question is:","output":"overspending. The rationale behind choosing \\"overspending\\" as the answer can be understood by closely analyzing the information given in the question and eliminating the other options systematically. Firstly, the question states that \\"Joe found that shopping was dangerous for him,\\" indicating that there is a negative aspect associated with his shopping habits. Moreover, it is mentioned that \\"he found himself doing this a great deal,\\" which suggests that the negative aspect is a repetitive, habitual behavior. Now let us examine the other choices and understand why they are not the correct answer: 1. Loss of money: The term \\"loss of money\\" suggests an unplanned expenditure or a financial loss, which might be a one-time or occasional occurrence. However, Joe's issue is with shopping, and the question emphasizes his repetitive behavior. Loss of money doesn't necessarily imply a repetitive habit tied to shopping, disqualifying it as the correct answer. 2. Run out of money: This choice is not the correct answer because the question clearly states that Joe has a great job, which implies that he has a stable income. Additionally, the question mentions that \\"there were always funds left over,\\" implying that he does not completely run out of money due to his shopping. 3. Spending money: This option does not highlight the negative aspect associated with Joe's shopping habit. It only states the obvious, which is that Joe spends money while shopping. However, it fails to address the \\"dangerous\\" aspect that the question emphasizes. 4. Deficit: The term \\"deficit\\" suggests a shortage or lack of something. Although it could imply a financial deficit due to shopping, the question states, \\"there were always funds left over.\\" Thus, Joe's situation does not align with the concept of a deficit, making this choice incorrect. Now that we have eliminated the other options, we can assert that the answer is, indeed, \\"overspending.\\" The rationale for choosing \\"overspending\\" lies in the fact that it directly addresses the negative aspect of Joe's shopping habits – spending more money than necessary on a consistent basis. This aligns with the information provided in the question, as Joe's \\"great job\\" might enable him to spend more than he should, leading to the danger associated with his shopping. Furthermore, it explains why there are still some leftover funds, but \\"not enough for his taste,\\" indicating that Joe would prefer to have more money available after his shopping sprees, but his overspending habit hinders this."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The severe allegations have prompted concerns over the upcoming FIFA World Cup in Russia, with voices like that of Collins suggesting that FIFA seriously reconsider the arrangements. The veracity and compliance of anti-doping measures that will be in place during the World Cup have been called into question, shedding doubt on Russia's overall sporting integrity. Despite Russia's Sports Ministry denying the claims, evidence suggests that the doping was state-sanctioned and systematic. The report implied that the doping system was planned and executed under the authority and support of the Russian government, thereby tainting the image of past sporting events like the London 2012 Olympic Games. One prominent figure under scrutiny is Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko, who was the sports minister during the period detailed in the McLaren report. Mutko is seeking re-election to the FIFA ruling committee, raising concerns over the role of Russian sports administrators who may be implicated in this scandal.  These revelations have called for sports bodies to scrutinize Russian athletes' participation in international events, and reconsider the roles of Russian administrators and politicians within international governing bodies, considering the scale of the state-sponsored doping scandal.

There are about 445 living Indo-European languages, according to the estimate by \\"Ethnologue\\", with over two-thirds (313) of them belonging to the Indo-Iranian branch. The most widely spoken Indo-European languages by native speakers are Spanish, English, Hindustani (Hindi and Urdu), Portuguese, Bengali, Russian, Persian and Punjabi, each with over 100 million speakers. Today, 46% of the human population speaks an Indo-European language natively, by far the highest of any language family.  - Opera (English plural: \\"operas\\"; Italian plural: \\"opere\\" ) is an art form in which singers and musicians perform a dramatic work combining text (libretto) and musical score, usually in a theatrical setting. In traditional opera, singers do two types of singing: recitative, a speech-inflected style and arias, a more melodic style. Opera incorporates many of the elements of spoken theatre, such as acting, scenery, and costumes and sometimes includes dance. The performance is typically given in an opera house, accompanied by an orchestra or smaller musical ensemble, which since the early 19th century has been led by a conductor.  - A cultural movement is a change in the way a number of different disciplines approach their work. This embodies all art forms, the sciences, and philosophies. Historically, different nations or regions of the world have gone through their own independent sequence of movements in culture, but as world communications have accelerated this geographical distinction has become less distinct. When cultural movements go through revolutions from one to the next, genres tend to get attacked and mixed up, and often new genres are generated and old ones fade. These changes are often reactions against the prior cultural form, which typically has grown stale and repetitive. An obsession emerges among the mainstream with the new movement, and the old one falls into neglect - sometimes it dies out entirely, but often it chugs along favored in a few disciplines and occasionally making reappearances (sometimes prefixed with \\"neo-\\").  - A manuscript (abbreviated MS for singular and MSS for plural) is any document written by hand or typewritten, as opposed to being mechanically printed or reproduced in some automated way. More recently, it is understood to be an author's written, typed, or word-processed copy of a work, as distinguished from the print of the same. Before the arrival of printing, all documents and books were manuscripts. Manuscripts are not defined by their contents, which may combine writing with mathematical calculations, maps, explanatory figures or illustrations. Manuscripts may be in book form, scrolls or in codex format. Illuminated manuscripts are enriched with pictures, border decorations, elaborately embossed initial letters or full-page illustrations.  - A troubadour was a composer and performer of Old Occitan lyric poetry during the High Middle Ages (11001350). Since the word \\"troubadour\\" is etymologically masculine, a female troubadour is usually called a trobairitz.  - The mass market is the largest group of end consumers for a specified product. It is the opposite of the term niche market.  - Musical theatre is a form of theatrical performance that combines songs, spoken dialogue, acting, and dance. The story and emotional content of a musical  humor, pathos, love, anger  are communicated through the words, music, movement and technical aspects of the entertainment as an integrated whole. Although musical theatre overlaps with other theatrical forms like opera and dance, it may be distinguished by the equal importance given to the music as compared with the dialogue, movement and other elements. Since the early 20th century, musical theatre stage works have generally been called, simply, musicals.  - A composer (Latin \\"compn\\"; literally \\"one who puts together\\") is a person who creates or writes music, which can be vocal music (for a singer or choir), instrumental music (e.g., for solo piano, string quartet, wind quintet or orchestra) or music which combines both instruments and voices (e.g., opera or art song, which is a singer accompanied by a pianist). The core meaning of the term refers to individuals who have contributed to the tradition of Western classical music through creation of works expressed in written musical notation (e.g., sheet music scores).  - A chansonnier (, Galician and , ) is a manuscript or printed book which contains a collection of chansons, or polyphonic and monophonic settings of songs, hence literally \\"song-books,\\" although some manuscripts are so called even though they preserve the text but not the music (for example, the Cancioneiro da Vaticana and Cancioneiro da Biblioteca Nacional, which contain the bulk of Galician-Portuguese lyric). The most important chansonniers contain lyrics, poems and songs of the troubadours and trouvères of the Middle Ages. Prior to 1420, many song-books contained both sacred and secular music, one exception being those containing the work of Guillaume de Machaut. Around 1420, sacred and secular music was segregated into separate sources, with large choirbooks containing sacred music, and smaller chansonniers for more private use by the privileged. Chansonniers were compiled primarily in France, but also in Italy, Germany and in the Iberian peninsula.  - The classical Latin alphabet, also known as the Roman alphabet, is a writing system originally used by the ancient Romans to write the Latin language. The Latin alphabet evolved from the visually similar Cumaean Greek version of the Greek alphabet, which was itself descended from the Phoenician abjad, which in turn was derived from Egyptian hieroglyphics. The Etruscans who ruled early Rome adopted the Cumaean Greek alphabet which was modified over time to become the Etruscan alphabet, which was in turn adopted and further modified by the Romans to produce the Latin alphabet.  - An art song is a vocal music composition, usually written for one voice with piano accompaniment, and usually in the classical art music tradition. By extension, the term \\"art song\\" is used to refer to the collective genre of such songs (e.g., the \\"art song repertoire\\"). An art song is most often a musical setting of an independent poem or text, \\"intended for the concert repertory\\" \\"as part of a recital or other relatively formal social occasion\\". While many pieces of vocal music are easily recognized as art songs, others are more difficult to categorize. For example, a wordless vocalise written by a classical composer is sometimes considered an art song and sometimes not.  - Latin (Latin: ) is a classical language belonging to the Italic branch of the Indo-European languages. The Latin alphabet is derived from the Etruscan and Greek alphabets.  - A classical language is a language with a literature that is \\"classical\\". According to UC Berkeley linguist George L. Hart, \\"it should be ancient, it should be an independent tradition that arose mostly on its own, not as an offshoot of another tradition, and it must have a large and extremely rich body of ancient literature.\\"  - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries.  - Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound and silence, which exist in time. The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the \\"color\\" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek  (\\"mousike\\"; \\"art of the Muses\\"). In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form include the production of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as \\"the harmony of the spheres\\" and \\"it is music to my ears\\" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, \\"There is no noise, only sound.\\"  - A song, most broadly, is a single (and often standalone) work of music that is typically intended to be sung by the human voice with distinct and fixed pitches and patterns using sound and silence and a variety of forms that often include the repetition of sections. Written words created specifically for music or for which music is specifically created, are called lyrics. If a pre-existing poem is set to composed music in classical music it is an art song. Songs that are sung on repeated pitches without distinct contours and patterns that rise and fall are called chants. Songs in a simple style that are learned informally are often referred to as folk songs. Songs that are composed for professional singers who sell their recordings or live shows to the mass market are called popular songs. These songs, which have broad appeal, are often composed by professional songwriters, composers and lyricists. Art songs are composed by trained classical composers for concert or recital performances. Songs are performed live and recorded on audio or video (or in some, cases, a song may be performed live and simultaneously recorded). Songs may also appear in plays, musical theatre, stage shows of any form, and within operas.  - France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories. The European, or metropolitan, area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean. Overseas France include French Guiana on the South American continent and several island territories in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. France spans and had a total population of almost 67 million people as of January 2017. It is a unitary semi-presidential republic with the capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre. Other major urban centres include Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Nice, Toulouse and Bordeaux.  - Trouvère, sometimes spelled trouveur , is the Northern French (langue d'oïl) form of the langue d'oc (Occitan) word \\"trobador\\". It refers to poet-composers who were roughly contemporary with and influenced by the troubadours (composers and performers of Old Occitan lyric poetry during the High Middle Ages) but who composed their works in the northern dialects of France. The first known \\"trouvère\\" was Chrétien de Troyes (\\"fl\\". 1160s-1180s) (Butterfield, 1997) and the \\"trouvères\\" continued to flourish until about 1300. Some 2130 \\"trouvère\\" poems have survived; of these, at least two-thirds have melodies.  - Classical music is art music produced or rooted in the traditions of Western music, including both liturgical (religious) and secular music. While a more accurate term is also used to refer to the period from 1750 to 1820 (the Classical period), this article is about the broad span of time from roughly the 11th century to the present day, which includes the Classical period and various other periods. The central norms of this tradition became codified between 1550 and 1900, which is known as the common-practice period. The major time divisions of Western art music are as follows:  European art music is largely distinguished from many other non-European and some popular musical forms by its system of staff notation, in use since about the 16th century. Western staff notation is used by composers to indicate to the performer the pitches (e.g., melodies, basslines, chords), tempo, meter and rhythms for a piece of music. This can leave less room for practices such as improvisation and \\"ad libitum\\" ornamentation, which are frequently heard in non-European art music and in popular-music styles such as jazz and blues. Another difference is that whereas most popular styles adopt the song (strophic) form, classical music has been noted for its development of highly sophisticated forms of instrumental music such as the concerto, symphony, sonata, and mixed vocal and instrumental styles such as opera which, since they are written down, can sustain larger forms and attain a high level of complexity.  - In the Middle Ages, the Galician-Portuguese lyric, sometimes called trovadorismo in Portugal and trobadorismo in Galicia, was a lyric poetic school or movement. All told, there are around 1680 texts in the so-called secular lyric or \\"lírica profana\\" (see Cantigas de Santa Maria for the religious lyric). At the time Galician-Portuguese was the language used in nearly all of Iberia for lyric (as opposed to epic) poetry. From this language derives both modern Galician and Portuguese. The school, which was influenced to some extent (mainly in certain formal aspects) by the Occitan troubadours, is first documented at the end of the twelfth century and lasted until the middle of the fourteenth, with its zenith coming in the middle of the thirteenth century, centered on the person of Alfonso X, \\"The Wise King\\". It is the earliest known poetic movement in Galicia or Portugal and represents not only the beginnings of but one of the high points of poetic history in both countries and in Medieval Europe. Modern Galicia has seen a revival movement called Neotrobadorismo.  - The Cancioneiro da Vaticana (, Vatican Songbook) is a compilation of troubadour lyrics in Galician-Portuguese. It was discovered c. 1840 in the holdings of the Vatican Library and was first transcribed by D. Caetano Lopes de Moura in 1847, sponsored by Viscount of Carreira, end again by Ernesto Monaci in 1875.  - A chanson ( French pronunciation :  ( s ) , \`\` song '' , from Latin cantio , gen. cantionis ) is in general any lyric - driven French song , usually polyphonic and secular . A singer specializing in chansons is known as a \`\` chanteur '' ( male ) or \`\` chanteuse '' ( female ) ; a collection of chansons , especially from the late Middle Ages and Renaissance , is also known as a chansonnier .  - Lyrics are words that make up a song usually consisting of verses and choruses. The writer of lyrics is a lyricist. The words to an extended musical composition such as an opera are, however, usually known as a \\"libretto\\" and their writer, as a \\"librettist\\". The meaning of lyrics can either be explicit or implicit. Some lyrics are abstract, almost unintelligible, and, in such cases, their explication emphasizes form, articulation, meter, and symmetry of expression. Rappers can also create lyrics with a variation of rhyming words or words that create and tell a story or song.  - The Cancioneiro da Biblioteca Nacional (, \\"The National Library Songbook\\"), commonly called Colocci-Brancuti, is a compilation of Galician-Portuguese lyrics by both troubadours and \\"jograes\\" (non-noble performers and composers) . These \\"cantigas\\" (songs) are classified, following indications in the poems themselves and in the manuscript tradition, into three main genres: \\"cantigas de amigo\\" (female-voiced love songs, about a boyfriend), \\"cantigas de amor\\" (male-voiced love songs) and \\"cantigas de escárnio e mal-dizer\\" (songs of mockery and insult).   - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world. Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin. Other major cities include Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Düsseldorf.  - The Renaissance was a period in European history, from the 14th to the 17th century, regarded as the cultural bridge between the Middle Ages and modern history. It started as a cultural movement in Italy in the Late Medieval period and later spread to the rest of Europe, marking the beginning of the Early Modern Age.  - A songwriter is an individual who writes the lyrics, melodies and chord progressions for songs, typically for a popular music genre such as rock or country music. A songwriter can also be called a composer, although the latter term tends to be used mainly for individuals from the classical music genre. The pressure from the music industry to produce popular hits means that songwriting is often an activity for which the tasks are distributed between a number of people. For example, a songwriter who excels at writing lyrics might be paired with a songwriter with a gift for creating original melodies. Pop songs may be written by group members from the band or by staff writers  songwriters directly employed by music publishers. Some songwriters serve as their own music publishers, while others have outside publishers.  - In the history of Europe, the Middle Ages or medieval period lasted from the 5th to the 15th century. It began with the fall of the Western Roman Empire and merged into the Renaissance and the Age of Discovery. The Middle Ages is the middle period of the three traditional divisions of Western history: classical antiquity, the medieval period, and the modern period. The medieval period is itself subdivided into the Early, High, and Late Middle Ages.  - History (from Greek , \\"historia\\", meaning \\"inquiry, knowledge acquired by investigation\\") is the study of the past as it is described in written documents. Events occurring before written record are considered prehistory. It is an umbrella term that relates to past events as well as the memory, discovery, collection, organization, presentation, and interpretation of information about these events. Scholars who write about history are called historians.  - The Greek alphabet has been used to write the Greek language since the late 9th century BC or early 8th century BC It was derived from the earlier Phoenician alphabet, and was the first alphabetic script to have distinct letters for vowels as well as consonants. It is the ancestor of the Latin and Cyrillic scripts. Apart from its use in writing the Greek language, in both its ancient and its modern forms, the Greek alphabet today also serves as a source of technical symbols and labels in many domains of mathematics, science and other fields.  - Italy, officially the Italian Republic, is a unitary parliamentary republic in Europe. Located in the heart of the Mediterranean Sea, Italy shares open land borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, San Marino and Vatican City. Italy covers an area of and has a largely temperate seasonal climate and Mediterranean climate; due to its shape, it is often referred to in Italy as \\"lo Stivale\\" (the Boot). With 61 million inhabitants, it is the fourth most populous EU member state.  - Guillaume de Machaut (sometimes spelled Machault; c. 1300  April 1377) was a medieval French poet and composer. He is one of the earliest composers on whom significant biographical information is available. According to Daniel Leech-Wilkinson, Machaut was \\"the last great poet who was also a composer\\". Well into the 15th century, Machaut's poetry was greatly admired and imitated by other poets, including Geoffrey Chaucer.

A chanson is a French polyphonic or secular song, usually lyric-driven, that is sometimes also referred to as a genre. In general, a chanson is any song in the French language, typically composed for a singer or choir. Chansons are often performed in a chansonnier, a collection of chansons, particularly those created during the Middle Ages and the Renaissance. The term \\"chanson\\" can also refer to an art song, which is a vocal music composition in the classical art music tradition, typically written for one voice with piano accompaniment. Chansonniers were significant repositories of the poetic and musical works of their time. They preserved the texts and melodies of troubadours and trouvères, two categories of poets and composers who were known for their lyric poetry during the High Middle Ages. While there are many surviving chansonniers, some of the most notable ones include the Cancioneiro da Vaticana, the Cancioneiro da Biblioteca Nacional, and the chansonnier of Guillaume de Machaut. These songbooks provide valuable insight into the artistic and cultural practices of their time and offer a window into the rich history of music and poetry in medieval Europe."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

They entered the Meadowlands against a New York Giants team trying to gain momentum that could lead them to a playoff spot. Hoping they could capitalize off the Saints loss, the Giants' first drive saw a 55-yard touchdown pass from Eli Manning to Plaxico Burress.  The Saints' offense opened with a three-and-out, but they successfully recovered their punt. A field goal narrowed the score to 7-3. A subsequent Saints drive ended with another field goal. With 10:30 left in the second quarter, the Saints directed a huge, time-eating drive that ended with a touchdown on fourth-down with just 1:56 left in the half. Seven minutes into the third quarter, Reggie Bush sped past the Giants' linebacker corps and scored on a one-yard touchdown, to lengthen the score to 20-7. In the middle of the third quarter, Reggie Bush returned a punt, fell onto his knees (but because nobody touched him he was not down by contact), and he then ran the ball in for a touchdown. However, a challenge revealed that the Giants' punter just barely nicked the leg of Bush, and he was ruled down by contact.  Early in the fourth quarter, Deuce McAllister ran it in for the final touchdown of the day, and John Carney sealed it with a 38-yard field goal. The Saints defense was stout throughout the game, shutting out the Giants after their opening touchdown, and never allowing the Giants to run a play in their territory. With the win, the Saints improved to 10-5.

Choices: -- install window insulation film, seal with a hair dryer -- install window insulation washer fluid, seal with a hair dryer","output":"To winterize your windows effectively, the first method, \\"install window insulation film, seal with a hair dryer,\\" makes more sense and is the more commonly used approach. Here is a detailed guide on how you can do this: 1. Gather Your Supplies: The first step to winterizing your windows with insulation film is to gather your supplies. What you'll need includes the insulation film itself (which is often sold in kits with enough material for multiple windows), a pair of scissors, a tape measure, a utility knife, and a hairdryer. 2. Measure Your Window: Before you cut your insulation film, you need to measure your window. Measure both the height and width, and then add an extra inch to each measurement. 3. Cut Insulation Film: After you've taken the measurements, unroll your film on a clean, flat surface and cut it according to the measurements you have.  4. Clean the Window Surface: Before applying the film, make sure to clean the window surface thoroughly. Dirty windows can hinder the adhesive tape from sticking properly.  5. Apply Double-Sided Tape: Once your window is clean and dry, install the double-sided tape around the outside of the window frame. It's important to apply the tape around the perimeter of the glass, ensuring that the film stays flattened against the window. 6. Attach Insulation Film: Carefully stick the edge of the film to one corner of the window, using the tape to hold it in place. Slowly unfold the film, pressing it onto the tape around the whole window. Do your best to avoid wrinkles and creases. 7. Tighten Film with Hair Dryer: Lastly, use a hair dryer on a low heat setting to \\"seal\\" the film. Move in about a two-inch distance around the edges of the window, slowly moving from the top of the window to the bottom. This will tighten the film, improving its insulating properties by creating an air pocket.  The options given do not include \\"install window insulation washer fluid\\" as it's not a recognized or effective window winterizing method. Washer fluid is typically used in vehicle maintenance and is not designed or suitable for home window insulation purposes. The principle behind window insulation film is to create an additional insulating layer of air between the window and the room, thereby reducing heat transfer and helping to maintain a more comfortable temperature in the room. Using a hair dryer to seal the film helps create this insulating layer. Therefore, the first option of installing window insulation film and sealing with a hair dryer is the best and most conventional method to winterize windows."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

But what they showed along with the songs was at times strange if not down right disturbing. The visuals presented in \\"Sons Of\\" were not at all what I would have expected. When I had heard Judy Collins sing this with her warmth and sincerity I had pictured something entirely different. I was actually quite glad that the visuals accompanying \\"If We Only Have Love\\" were relatively simple. That's a song I have always liked and I was delighted not to see it visually interpreted in some bizarre fashion as were some of the other songs.I think had they just shot this as a stage production or as an \\"in concert\\" format it would have been better.

The first night of filming at the Thornbury Bowls Club was for a test shoot with mine and Rosie’s camera, to work out which one we wanted to use for her film. The second night of filming involved us getting establishing shots of the location. The third night of filming involved us mainly shooting Rosie’s script. And the fourth night of shooting involved us mainly shooting Bell’s script and getting any other shots we needed to get. Perhaps we didn’t need an entire night of filming just to get establishing shots and filler shots, but it certainly made it a lot easier having multiple shots to choose from. For the two nights of shooting we certainly didn’t get that much coverage, which meant in the edit we were somewhat stuck using certain shots because we didn’t have other options. This was mainly because of time limitations with actors and batteries on cameras dying and such. I’m so neurotic I would have happily spent two nights shooting establishing shots and filler shots and two nights on each shoot, but not everyone wants to rearrange the rest of their life to fit around such projects. I get a tad obsessive if I’m allowed, which can often benefit me, although I do become a giant pain in everyone else’s ass. The main thing I learnt from the filming process was that you can plan out exactly what you want to do, and how your going to do it, but once you get into the location with the actors this plan often changes – however, you are still much better of having the plan than none at all! As the neurotic freak I am, I had all the shots I wanted to use storyboarded. I had originally planned to shoot all the establishing shots, stick them in a timeline and then also shoot the other shots (with fill in actors) and add them to the timeline to see how it looked.

Article: Dash cam video of Zachary Hammond shooting      On July 26, 2015, 19-year-old Zachary Hammond, of Seneca, was shot and killed by Lt. Mark Tiller of the Seneca Police Department. SLED closed its investigation of the shooting and recommended that no charges should be filed against Tiller. ||||| Lieutenant Mark Tiller, who shot and killed the 19-year-old in South Carolina in July 2015, fired from Seneca police force for unspecified reason      A police officer who was not charged in the shooting death of an unarmed South Carolina teenager is being fired from the force more than a year after the incident.      Zachary Hammond shooting: officer who killed teen avoids criminal charges Read more      The family of Zachary Hammond, who was 19 when he was shot and killed by Lieutenant Mark Tiller in July 2015, said they had “never lost hope” of such an outcome.      Seneca police chief John Covington said in a short statement that Tiller was being terminated and would stay on the payroll until Friday. He refused to give a reason, calling it a personnel matter.      A state prosecutor did not press charges against Tiller for the killing of Hammond, saying while Tiller might have made a bad decision in heading toward Hammond’s moving car, the officer had less than three seconds to react and broke no law.      Hammond was killed while driving away from a drug sting operation. A dashboard recording showed that the teen was shot from the side as he passed the officer.      The FBI and US justice department are still investigating the case.      Hammond’s family, who in March reached a 2.15m settlement with the city of Seneca, released a statement saying they were glad Tiller would no longer be a police officer.            “After Zachary’s death, the Hammonds placed their faith in the justice system and were hoping that Lieutenant Tiller was going to have to answer for his actions and the decisions he made which resulted in such a senseless death,” the statement said.      “With each passing day the Hammonds never lost hope that Lieutenant Tiller would in the future never again have the highest honor of serving the public as a police officer, wear the uniform and carry a weapon. It appears that today is such a day.” ||||| Video      A South Carolina police lieutenant who fatally shot a 19-year-old man during an attempted drug arrest in a Hardee’s parking lot last year has been fired from his job, the police chief said. The officer contended that he was acting in self-defense when the suspect drove a car toward him.      John Covington, the chief of the police in Seneca, S.C., said in an emailed statement on Monday that Lt. Mark Tiller had been terminated from his position on the force.      In the statement, which was sent over the weekend to local media including The State newspaper, Chief Covington gave no reason for the termination and declined to answer further questions on what he called a personnel matter.      The lieutenant’s final day on the payroll will be Sept. 9, he said.      Lt. Tiller had been on paid administrative leave since the shooting, which took place on July 26, 2015, during a sting operation targeting a 19-year-old man, Zachary Hammond, and a female companion. Police officers suspected a drug deal, and Lt. Tiller used his patrol car to block Mr. Hammond’s vehicle when he pulled into a Hardee’s parking lot.      According to an Oconee County coroner’s report, Lt. Tiller then “felt threatened” as Mr. Hammond drove his car toward him. The officer fired two shots through the open window on the driver’s side, striking Mr. Hammond once in the shoulder and once fatally in the chest, the report said.      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      Prosecutors declined to press charges against Lt. Tiller, saying a dashboard video of the shooting supported his contention that he believed he was going to be run over.      The officer, who had not faced any disciplinary action since he started working with the Seneca police in 2010, was put on leave while under investigation by the Justice Department for possible civil rights violations.      The video elevated the shooting in Seneca, a town of about 8,000 people in the northwest part of the state, into the national debate about police conduct that spread after the fatal shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., in August 2014. Unlike that case, in which a white policeman killed an unarmed black man, both the officer and Mr. Hammond were white.      Even so, supporters said the case was yet another example of questionable police behavior that had shaken communities around the country.      The Seneca case also rejuvenated calls for police to wear body cameras, and the department was criticized for letting the situation evolve from an effort to trap his companion into selling a small amount of marijuana.      A lawyer for Lt. Tiller, John M. Mussetto, said the department had been “very tight lipped” about the reasons for his client’s termination from the force and said it made “no sense” after the state determined there was no basis to press criminal charges.      “After many years of service in law enforcement, it is unfortunate that Lt. Tiller was given such short notice,” he said. “Lt. Tiller looks forward the day when he can share his account of the unfortunate July 2015 incident.”      Eric S. Bland, a lawyer for the Hammond family, had urged the news media to treat the killing of Mr. Hammond as they had shootings of unarmed black men.      Advertisement Continue reading the main story      On Saturday, after the termnation was first announced, Mr. Bland said Chief Covington’s decision was “admirable.”      “As one would suspect, the last year has been extremely difficult for the Hammond Family,” he said in an email.      “One of the nagging questions for the Hammond Family was how could Lt. Tiller remain employed after Chief Covington and the City Administration saw the video of Zachary’s killing,” he said. “Today, that question was answered.”      In March this year, the Hammond family agreed to a 2.15 million settlement to drop their lawsuit against the police. ||||| Rating is available when the video has been rented.

Background: The Joker is a fictional supervillain created by Bill Finger, Bob Kane, and Jerry Robinson who first appeared in the debut issue of the comic book Batman (April 25, 1940), published by DC Comics. Credit for the Joker's creation is disputed; Kane and Robinson claimed responsibility for the Joker's design, while acknowledging Finger's writing contribution. Although the Joker was planned to be killed off during his initial appearance, he was spared by editorial intervention, allowing the character to endure as the archenemy of the superhero Batman. In his comic book appearances, the Joker is portrayed as a criminal mastermind. Context: The Joker was one of the few popular villains continuing to appear regularly in Batman comics from the Golden Age into the Silver Age, as the series continued during the rise in popularity of mystery and romance comics. In 1951, Finger wrote an origin story for the Joker in Detective Comics #168, which introduced the characteristic of him formerly being the criminal Red Hood, and his disfigurement the result of a fall into a chemical vat.  By 1954, the Comics Code Authority had been established in response to increasing public disapproval of comic book content. The backlash was inspired by Frederic Wertham, who hypothesized that mass media (especially comic books) was responsible for the rise in juvenile delinquency, violence and homosexuality, particularly in young males. Parents forbade their children from reading comic books, and there were several mass burnings. The Comics Code banned gore, innuendo and excessive violence, stripping Batman of his menace and transforming the Joker into a goofy, thieving trickster without his original homicidal tendencies.  The character appeared less frequently after 1964, when Julius Schwartz (who disliked the Joker) became editor of the Batman comics. The character risked becoming an obscure figure of the preceding era until this goofy prankster version of the character was adapted into the 1966 television series Batman, in which he was played by Cesar Romero. The show's popularity compelled Schwartz to keep the comics in a similar vein. As the show's popularity waned, however, so did that of the Batman comics. After the TV series ended in 1968, the increase in public visibility had not stopped the comic's sales decline; editorial director Carmine Infantino resolved to turn things around, moving stories away from schoolboy-friendly adventures. The Silver Age introduced several of the Joker's defining character traits: lethal joy buzzers, acid-squirting flowers, trick guns, and goofy, elaborate crimes. Question: Are there any other interesting aspects about this article? Answer:","output":"Yes, there are some interesting aspects about this article! One interesting thing is the change in the Joker's character over time. In the beginning, he was a very scary and dangerous criminal. But then, because of the Comics Code Authority, he became more of a silly and harmless trickster. This change made him less scary, but also less popular. Another interesting thing is how the 1966 Batman TV series with Cesar Romero as the Joker made the character popular again. This show was very successful, and it made people like the Joker even though he was still a goofy prankster in it. Finally, it's interesting to see how the Joker's character changed again after the TV show ended. The Batman comics started making the Joker more dangerous and scary again, which brought back some of his original appeal. Some of the silly things about the Joker from the Silver Age, like his special gadgets and funny tricks, still remained part of his character. So, the Joker has had a lot of different versions over the years, but he has always been an important and interesting part of Batman's story."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He was known for his skills as a lock and had a significant rugby career during the early 20th century. Oliver played for multiple clubs, including Talywain RFC, Pill Harriers RFC, and Pontypool RFC.  He began his rugby career before 1920 and maintained a strong presence in the game until 1921. In the year 1920, he started making appearances on the international stage as a player for the Wales national team. Throughout his time playing for Wales, George Oliver had four appearances and managed to make a lasting impact on the rugby field. Despite his efforts, he did not score any tries or goals during his international matches, resulting in zero points for his career. Though he was not able to add any points to his name, Oliver's dedication and skills in the lock position were undoubtedly valuable for his team.

It’s important to note that Oliver primarily played rugby union, a sport that emphasized teamwork and endurance. After an influential and noteworthy career, George Oliver decided to retire from rugby. Although no specific date regarding his retirement is provided, it can be inferred that he retired sometime after his last international appearance in 1921.

Choose the most suitable option to answer the above question. Options: - show - in cinema - theatre - bench - martorell Answer:","output":"The play was nearly starting, everybody took their seat in the theatre. This option is the most suitable because a play is typically performed live on stage in a theatre. The term \\"theatre\\" refers to a building or structure specifically designed for the presentation of live dramatic performances, where the audience is seated in an auditorium facing the stage. The unique atmosphere and excitement of a live play make the experience more engaging and memorable for the audience. In this context, the best answer is undoubtedly the theatre. Here is a brief explanation of why the other options are less suitable: - Show: This term is too general and could refer to various types of performances, including television shows, movies, and even concerts. It does not specifically refer to a building or location where the audience would be seated, as the question suggests. - In cinema: While a cinema is a place where people take their seats to watch movies, it is not the appropriate setting for a live play. Plays are performed in theaters, whereas cinemas are designed for screening films. - Bench: Although a bench can provide seating, it is not typically found in a setting designed for the presentation of live plays. A bench would be more commonly found in a park or other outdoor setting, not within the confines of a theater where a play would be taking place. - Martorell: This term does not seem related to the question at all.

Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf.

Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","output":"The premise does not entail the hypothesis. The premise and hypothesis present two different expectations regarding the allocation of state resources. Let's break down each statement to understand why they do not entail each other. Premise: - The individual is expected to use his position as head of the National Economic Council and later as treasury secretary for a specific purpose. - The purpose mentioned is to redirect federal resources toward inner cities and the underclass. This indicates a focus on urban areas and economically disadvantaged communities or families. Hypothesis: - The individual is expected to redirect state resources in his position, presumably as head of the National Economic Council, although the role is not explicitly mentioned. - The expectation is for resources to be redirected to rural areas and the wealthy. This is a different focus than in the premise, where the emphasis was on urban areas and disadvantaged groups. The two statements present contrasting expectations regarding the allocation of resources, which belong to different areas and different social strata. In the premise, the expectation is focused on channeling resources to inner cities and the underclass, while the hypothesis is centered on redirecting resources to rural areas and the wealthy. Since the expectations stated in the premise and hypothesis are not congruent, and they involve distinctive target groups and geographical areas, the premise does not entail the hypothesis."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I have a habit of making mental errors; some funny, some not. This one just happens to be funny. We had “open critiques” in art school. The idea was A- to point out how we could do it better, and B- to toughen us up for the advertising world. It’s brutal, cruel, and cutthroat, and get ready for your stupid clients to ruin your tasteful design and fuck it all kinds of up to put a picture of their ugly-ass crotch dropping on there, or a huge starburst that says “SALE SALE SALE!”. You had to learn not to care, and do your fulfilling artwork on the side. It’s just a job; nothing personal. We were in the middle of a critique, and it was turning ugly. The only time our professor would jump in was if it turned personal. It had. He laid back and let us fight it out, until someone told the girl we were critiquing that “with your taste from growing up in a trailer park, looks like you’ll be working for the Auto Trader” (a shitty, newsprint magazine that people sell used cars in- the worst of the worst design jobs). Before our professor could comment, I blurted out “For fuck’s sake, Mom….” I was about to say “tell them to break it the fuck up!” until the laughter started. Then I realized I’d called my professor, who had an MFA and spent 20 years in advertising at Saatchi and Saatchi, “Mom”. He responded with such amazing, quick wit; “Ms. Hood, I admire your devotion to your mother; just remember she stays home while you come to class.” I caught hell for it that entire semester. Luckily, we (almost) all had pretty tough skins, so it was amusing, even to our somewhat staid professor. He wrote on my end of semester assessment “Respectfully, Not Your Mom.” I still keep that assessment to remind me to wear life like a loose garment.

At least that's the consensus of Travel + Leisure magazine's readers, who were asked to rank 35 major U.S. metropolitan areas on their snobbishness. San Francisco was voted the city that holds its nose highest in the sky, followed by New York City, Boston, Minneapolis-St. Paul and Santa Fe/Seattle, which were tied for fifth. T+L says readers were asked to consider various factors, such as the city's reputation for aloof and smarty-pants residents as well as the presence of high-end shopping, good-looking locals, trendy food trucks and highbrow cultural offerings like classical music and theater. The mag cites San Francisco's reputation for being a serious foodie city as cause of its high ranking. Here are the top 10 cities to make the OPTIONS: - Boston \\"America's snobbiest cities\\" list. - Criteria \\"America's snobbiest cities\\" list. - Minneapolis \\"America's snobbiest cities\\" list. - New York City \\"America's snobbiest cities\\" list. - San Francisco \\"America's snobbiest cities\\" list. - Santa Fe \\"America's snobbiest cities\\" list. - Seattle \\"America's snobbiest cities\\" list. - St. Paul \\"America's snobbiest cities\\" list. - T+L \\"America's snobbiest cities\\" list. - Travel + Leisure magazine \\"America's snobbiest cities\\" list. - U.S. \\"America's snobbiest cities\\" list. - Victorian \\"America's snobbiest cities\\" list.","output":"Here are the top 10 cities to make the \\"America's snobbiest cities\\" list: 1. San Francisco: As the city that holds its nose highest in the sky, San Francisco takes the top spot on the list. Known for its stunning architecture, diverse culture, and passion for gourmet cuisine, it's no wonder that it's considered a snobby city. Residents pride themselves on their city's unique character, innovative tech scene, and progressive values, which may contribute to their air of superiority. 2. New York City: As the quintessential cosmopolitan city, New York City claims second place on the list. With a gritty yet glamorous image and an unparalleled arts and fashion scene, NYC boasts an impressive array of snobbish elements. The city's innumerable high-end shopping destinations, gourmet restaurants, and exclusive events practically scream snobbery. 3. Boston: Third on the list is the historic and highbrow city of Boston. The city's intellectual atmosphere, courtesy of prestigious universities like Harvard and MIT, as well as its rich cultural offerings, makes it a haven for the upper crust. With a strong sports team following, well-manicured parks, and upscale shopping districts, Boston's snobbery is hard to deny. 4. Minneapolis-St. Paul: Sharing fourth place are the twin cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul. They boast a thriving arts scene, an icy-cool atmosphere, and a penchant for fine dining and high-end shopping. The Minneapolis-St. Paul area's growing culinary reputation is a source of pride for its residents, further contributing to its snob appeal. 5. Santa Fe/Seattle: Tied for fifth place are Santa Fe and Seattle, two cities with unique personalities. Santa Fe's rich history and strong artistic roots create an air of sophistication, while Seattle's eco-friendliness, penchant for high-quality coffee, and booming tech scene make it a popular destination for the elite. Both cities value sustainability and culture, further cementing their spots on the list. 6. Chicago: With its stunning skyline, Chicago exudes an aura of snobbery that cannot be ignored. The city's wealth of hotspots like the Magnificent Mile, charming neighborhoods, and undefeated art scene makes it a hub for the elite. Chicago's dedication to deep-dish pizza and world-class shopping elevates its position on the list. 7. Los Angeles: Home to the legendary Hollywood elite, Los Angeles stands in seventh place on the list. The city's dazzling blend of palm trees, luxury vehicles, and designer boutiques is the epitome of snob appeal. With a celebrity-driven culture and a constant competition for appearances, Los Angeles is undeniably a snobby city. 8. Austin: Eighth on the list is Austin, the quirky capital of Texas. Known for its \\"please keep Austin weird\\" slogan, the city offers an exclusive vibe with upscale neighborhoods, high-end shopping, and a thriving music and arts scene. The increasingly competitive culinary landscape also adds to Austin's snobbiness. 9. Philadelphia: As the birthplace of American democracy, it's perhaps fitting that Philadelphia ranks ninth on the list. The City of Brotherly Love boasts prestigious universities, historical sites, and a passionate loyalty to its sports teams. With numerous upscale restaurants and bars, the city is rich in cultural offerings and snob appeal. 10. Denver: Last but not least, Denver rounds out the top 10. Known for its great outdoors and affinity for craft beer, Denver attracts an elite crowd dedicated to the finer things in life. A thriving food scene, unique art districts, and the nearby Rocky Mountains add to the city's snobbish charm. This concludes the top 10 cities that made it onto Travel + Leisure magazine's \\"America's snobbiest cities\\" list. Each city has its own unique blend of highbrow culture, exclusive amenities and desirable characteristics that contribute to their position on the list."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal?","output":"If bitten by a shark in the ocean, it is crucial to act promptly and effectively to minimize damage and maximize your chances of survival. The following steps and guidance make the most sense to accomplish this goal: 1. Stay Calm: Panicking or thrashing will increase your heart rate, which may make you more vulnerable to blood loss and attract more sharks. It is essential to stay as calm as possible despite the adrenaline rush and fear. 2. Defend Yourself: If the shark is still present, prepare to defend yourself. Target the sensitive areas of the shark such as the eyes, gills, and snout. Use any available objects such as a camera, dive knife, or snorkel to strike these areas. If no objects are available, use your fists or elbows. 3. Minimize Movement: Minimizing your movement will help you conserve energy and reduce blood loss. Instead, try to slowly and steadily move towards safety while keeping an eye out for the shark. 4. Control Bleeding: Once the shark has left, immediately attend to the wound. Using any clean and available materials, apply direct pressure to the wound to minimize blood loss. Use a tourniquet if necessary to control bleeding from a limb. Remember that controlling blood loss is crucial to survival. 5. Signal for Help: If you're with a group, immediately alert them of the situation and ask for assistance. If you have a signaling device such as a flare or whistle, use it to call for help. Raising one arm above your head is a universal distress signal. 6. Make Your Way to Safety: As cautiously and quickly as possible, move towards the shore, a boat, or any nearby platform. If you are with other people, swim together as a group to appear larger to the shark, which may deter it from attacking again. 7. Stay Warm: As you make your way to safety, try to keep yourself warm. Hypothermia may occur due to blood loss, which can negatively affect your chances of survival. 8. Seek Medical Attention: Once you are safely ashore or on board a vessel, seek immediate medical attention. No matter how minor the injury may seem, a shark bite can introduce bacteria and other harmful organisms into your body, potentially resulting in infection. 9. Report the Incident: Notify local authorities about the shark attack to help protect other beachgoers and swimmers. Share any details about the shark, the location, and any warning signs that might help prevent future incidents. By following these steps and advice, you maximize your chances of survival and recovery if bitten by a shark in the ocean. Remember, the most effective way to prevent shark attacks is by being aware of your surroundings and adhering to local warnings and guidelines when swimming in the ocean."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The choice of the next Speaker was the first act of the new Parliament before newly elected MPs are sworn in. Mr Bercow told MPs that he would be the \\"champion of backbenchers\\" and ensure the Commons remained at \\"the heart of our democratic system\\". Mr Bercow has divided opinion among MPs since first being elected in 2009. Efforts by the Conservatives on the final day of the last Parliament to change the procedures for the Speaker's re-election - which would have made it easier to oust him - were defeated after rebel Tories joined forces with Labour and others to block them. Mr Bercow was re-elected without a vote on Monday, as was the case after the 2010 election. If a single MP had objected to him continuing in the role, a vote of all MPs would have been held. Mr Bercow said he had been honoured to serve as Speaker for the past six years and would be honoured to continue in that role for a \\"little longer\\". He said he would discharge his responsibilities \\"effectively, efficiently and fairly\\", holding the government \\"properly to account\\". Prime Minister David Cameron, who has clashed with the Speaker in the past, congratulated Mr Bercow and acknowledged the \\"inclusive way in which he had upheld this office - always putting backbenchers first\\". Acting Labour leader Harriet Harman paid a fulsome tribute to Mr Bercow, saying he was a \\"giant in the office\\" and, in her opinion, the best holder of the position she had known in more than 30 years in the House. His re-appointment was also welcomed by Angus Robertson, the leader of the SNP's 56 MPs in Parliament as well as by Nigel Dodds, leader of the Democratic Unionists in the Commons and Dr Alasdair McDonnell, leader of the SDLP in Parliament. Former Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael welcomed Mr Bercow's re-appointment on behalf of the Lib Dems, joking that he was speaking on behalf of the \\"elite cadre\\" of his party's representatives left in Parliament after they were reduced from 57 to eight MPs. Conservative MP Jacob Rees-Mogg, who nominated Mr Bercow, said it was vital for \\"constitutional reasons\\" that Speakers were not removed against the will of the Commons. \\"The Speaker is the champion of the House of Commons against all comers,\\" he said. \\"The champion of the Commons against the Lords, sometimes against the judges, but perhaps most particularly against the executive.\\" Many MPs have praised Mr Bercow's reforms to Commons procedure, insisting they breathed new life into Parliament and gave the opposition and backbenchers more opportunity to question ministers on urgent matters. But some Conservatives regard Mr Bercow - who used to be a Conservative MP but as Speaker is independent and non-partisan - as a polarising figure and suggest that he unduly favoured Labour and the Lib Dems in the last Parliament. Mr Bercow, who is responsible for maintaining discipline in the Commons, was first elected in the wake of the scandal over MPs' expenses, which led to the resignation of his predecessor Michael Martin. Mr Cameron and Ms Harman also paid tribute to Sir Gerald Kaufman, the Labour MP who has become the Father of the House - an honorific status denoting the longest-serving MP in the Commons. MPs will be sworn in over the next three days prior to the State Opening of Parliament on 27 May, when the Queen's Speech - the government's legislative programme for the year ahead - will be announced.

Q:Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person whose portrait is described as one of Dürer's most exact and honest portraits?  Portrait Diptych of Dürer's Parents (or Dürer's Parents with Rosaries) is the collective name for two late-15th century portrait panels by the German painter and printmaker Albrecht Dürer. They show the artist's parents, Barbara Holper (c. 1451–1514) and Albrecht Dürer the Elder (c. 1427–1502), when she was around 39 and he was 63 years. The portraits are unflinching records of the physical and emotional effects of ageing. The Dürer family was close and Dürer may have intended the panels either to display his skill to his parents or as keepsakes while he travelled soon after as a journeyman painter. They were created either as pendants, that is conceived as a pair and intended to hang alongside each other, or diptych wings. However this formation may have been a later conception; Barbara's portrait seems to have been executed some time after her husband's and it is unusual for a husband to be placed to the viewer's right in paired panels. His father's panel is considered the superior work and has been described as one of Dürer's most exact and honest portraits. They are among four paintings or drawings Dürer made of his parents, each of which unsentimentally examines the deteriorating effects of age. His later writings contain eulogies for both parents, from which the love and respect he felt toward them is evident. Each panel measured 47.5 cm x 39.5 cm (18.7 in x 15.6 in), but the left hand panel has been cut down.

The workspace should also be free from potential hazards, such as liquids, direct sunlight, or unstable surfaces. 3. Acclimate the documents: If the documents have been stored in an environment with different temperature and humidity levels, it is important for Cameron to let them acclimate to the new environment before handling them. This can take a few hours or even a day, depending on the materials. 4. Gather necessary tools: Depending on the nature of the documents, Cameron may need various tools for handling them, such as a bone folder, a soft brush, paperweights, or archival sleeves. These tools can help him handle the documents without causing damage. 5. Remove jewelry and watches: To avoid accidental scratches or tears, Cameron should remove any jewelry or watches before handling the documents. 6.

The flashbacks picks up when Lucky, born and raised on the Balkan Peninsula, tries to marry into money and goes to the U.S. to find himself a wealthy bride. He has no luck, despite his name, and instead makes an attempt to bluff his way forward, pretending to be count De Kloven, a rich aristocrat. As De Kloven, Lucky gets hired to escort the prominent socialite Mrs. Lola Morgan, but quits when she wants him to be her lover. Instead he tries a new disguise, as Rudolph Von Hertsen, and gets involved in another racket with a Dr. J.M. Randall, performing abortions and selling unwanted babies. When the racket is disclosed, Lucky moves on to the business of pimping young women  into prostitution. He goes as far as to trick naive young women into laying their lives in his hands, selling them as sex-slaves, thus entering into the business of white slavery. He soon becomes the head of such an organization. His right-arm man, Nick goes to lengths to get new merchandise for the business, and kidnaps Dorothy, a young, blonde schoolgirl. The election of a new ambitious district attorney causes Lucky problems, but he refuses to slow down. Lucky falls in love with a beautiful woman named Lois, but his affections are not returned, and she has to run for her life from his long lawless arms, with the help of one of Lucky's more goodhearted men, Harry.

Solve 46*s + 208 + 68 = 0 for s.","output":"To solve the equation 46*s + 208 + 68 = 0 for variable s, you need to follow these steps: Step 1: Simplify the equation First, you can combine the constant terms (208 and 68) together: 46*s + (208 + 68) = 0 46*s + 276 = 0 Step 2: Isolate the variable (s) on one side of the equation Now, you need to isolate the variable s on one side of the equation. To do that, subtract the constant (276) from both sides of the equation: 46*s + 276 - 276 = 0 - 276 46*s = -276 Step 3: Solve for variable s Now, to find the value of s, you will divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of the variable, which is 46: 46*s / 46 = -276 / 46 s = -6 So, the solution to the equation 46*s + 208 + 68 = 0 is s = -6."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

One particular year the corn crop fails and the people of Gatlin turn to prayer in an attempt to ensure a successful harvest.

Isaac, through his 17-year-old lieutenant Malachai, leads the children in a revolution, brutally killing all of the adults in the town. Over the ensuing years, the children take any adults passing through as sacrifices. Three years later, Vicky and her boyfriend Burt pass through Nebraska while driving cross-country to Burt's new job as a physician in Seattle, Washington.

Researchers have found that those who eat a handful of peanuts every day significantly decrease their risk of dying from all causes compared to those who do not eat nuts. A new study concludes that all types of nuts seem to be protective. Researcher Ying Bao is with the Department of Medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard University Medical School in Boston, Massachusetts. She and her colleagues looked at the impact of nut consumption by analyzing two huge studies that began in 1980 - the Nurses' Health Study, which tracks the of more than 76,000 women, and 42,000 men enrolled in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study. Among the questions asked at the beginning of the studies was, 'how frequently do you eat nuts?'  The information was updated every two to four years. Bao says the participants were followed for three decades. \\"What we observed is that people who eat more nuts are less likely to die over the next 30 years,\\" said Bao. \\"So, for example, if a person eat(s) nuts once per day, that person has a 20 percent lower risk of dying.\\" Bao says eating a handful of nuts five or more times per week was associated with a 29 percent reduced risk of dying from heart disease and an 11 percent lower risk of cancer death.  A serving size is 28 grams. Nuts contain nutrients, including high quality proteins, vitamins and minerals, all of which have anti-cancer effects and may help protect the heart. Bao says researchers are planning studies to find out how nuts are beneficial to human health. The study on the health benefits of nuts was funded by the International Tree Nut Council Research and Education Foundation. Question: The passage is most probably from a journal of    _    .

Bowie was born David Robert Jones on 8 January 1947 in Brixton, London. His mother, Margaret Mary \\"Peggy\\" (née Burns; 2 October 1913 – 2 April 2001), was born at Shorncliffe Army Camp near Cheriton, Kent. Her paternal grandparents were Irish immigrants who had settled in Manchester. She worked as a waitress at a cinema in Royal Tunbridge Wells. His father, Haywood Stenton \\"John\\" Jones (21 November 1912 – 5 August 1969), was from Doncaster, and worked as a promotions officer for the children's charity Barnardo's. The family lived at 40 Stansfield Road, on the boundary between Brixton and Stockwell in the south London borough of Lambeth. Bowie attended Stockwell Infants School until he was six years old, acquiring a reputation as a gifted and single-minded child—and a defiant brawler.In 1953, Bowie moved with his family to Bromley. Two years later, he started attending Burnt Ash Junior School. His voice was considered \\"adequate\\" by the school choir, and he demonstrated above-average abilities in playing the recorder. At the age of nine, his dancing during the newly-introduced music and movement classes was strikingly imaginative: teachers called his interpretations \\"vividly artistic\\" and his poise \\"astonishing\\" for a child. The same year, his interest in music was further stimulated when his father brought home a collection of American 45s by artists including the Teenagers, the Platters, Fats Domino, Elvis Presley, and Little Richard. Upon listening to Little Richard's song \\"Tutti Frutti\\", Bowie would later say that he had \\"heard God\\".Bowie was first impressed with Presley when he saw his cousin dance to \\"Hound Dog\\". By the end of the following year, he had taken up the ukulele and tea-chest bass, begun to participate in skiffle sessions with friends, and had started to play the piano; meanwhile, his stage presentation of numbers by both Presley and Chuck Berry—complete with gyrations in tribute to the original artists—to his local Wolf Cub group was described as \\"mesmerizing ... like someone from another...

First he saw a Leeuwenhoek microscope, which was labeled as item A, then he saw a compound microscope of Leeuwenhoek's time, which was labeled as item B. At the very end of his museum tour he saw a modern compound light microscope, which was labeled as item C.  Hint: During the 1670s, the Dutch tradesman Antony van Leeuwenhoek, shown in Figure below , used microscopes to observe many microbes and body cells. Leeuwenhoek developed an interest in microscopy and ground his own lenses to make simple microscopes. Leeuwenhoek was so good at making lenses that his simple microscopes were able to magnify much more clearly than the compound microscopes of his day. His microscope's increased ability to magnify over 200x is comparable to a modern compound light microscope. Compound microscopes , which are microscopes that use more than one lens, had been invented around 1595 by Zacharias Jansen, a Dutch spectacle-maker. Several people, including Robert Hooke, had built compound microscopes and were making important discoveries with them during Leeuwenhoek’s time.","output":"Item B, the compound microscope of Leeuwenhoek's time, would have more lenses than item A (the Leeuwenhoek microscope), because compound microscopes use more than one lens, while Leeuwenhoek's microscopes were simple microscopes with a single lens."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Article: If someone asks you, \\"What colour is the sky?\\" I think you will answer \\"blue\\". I'm afraid that you will be wrong. The sky has no colour. It looks blue because we are looking at the blue sunlight. The sunlight is shining on little bits of dust  in the air. Is the sky full of air? I'm sure that you have asked this question, too. We know that there is air all around the world, but we couldn't fly very high because as we go high, the air gets thinner. If we go far enough away from the earth, we find there is no air. Maybe we can answer some questions now. What is the sky? Where is it? It is all round the world. The sky is space . In space there is nothing, but only the sun, the moon, the earth and all the other stars. Question: We can't fly very high because   _  . Yes or no, is the answer \\"there's no air in the high enough sky\\"? Answer:","output":"Yes, the statement \\"We can't fly very high because there's no air in the high enough sky\\" is accurate. In the context of the provided article, the scenario discussed outlines humans' inability to fly significantly high due to the nature of the Earth's atmosphere.  To delve further, the Earth's atmosphere is composed of several layers, each with varied density levels. Closest to the surface is the troposphere, where we experience regular weather, birds fly, and airplanes reach typical cruising altitudes. Up to about 8 to 15 kilometers, the air is thick with oxygen necessary for human life and for supporting the combustion engines of most aircraft. Beyond the troposphere is the stratosphere. Above this, stratospheric air becomes progressively thinner in the mesosphere and thermosphere and almost non-existent in the exosphere extending out into space. The air is so thin higher up that it cannot support human life or most conventional aircraft. This is partially why we need specially designed spacecraft to travel beyond our atmosphere. Hence, the diminishing level of air, or its thinness, is an inhibitive factor for us to fly very high. If we ascend too high, the rarity of air would prevent our lungs from getting enough oxygen to sustain life. Additionally, it would make it impossible for most aircraft to generate enough lift or for their engines to function properly. Briefly said, once we are far enough away from the Earth, there is no air – a fact that confirms the reason we primarily can't fly exceedingly high is indeed the absence of air. This situation is what creates the boundary of our salient exploration being the surface of our planet and the immediate atmosphere."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Fact 2: An example of water vapor is steam.  Given the two facts above, transpiration is when steam moves from _ into the atmosphere? The answer is:","output":"Transpiration is when steam moves from plants into the atmosphere.  To provide an in-depth explanation, let's break down the process of transpiration and its role in the water cycle. Transpiration is a crucial component of the water cycle, whereby water from the Earth's surface is converted into water vapor and returns to the atmosphere. Plants play a vital role in this process, as they uptake water through their root systems and subsequently release it back into the atmosphere through their leaves.  The process of transpiration involves the transportation of water from a plant's root system, up its stems, and finally to the tiny openings located on the leaves' undersides, known as stomata. At the stomata, the water is turned into water vapor (also referred to as steam in this case) and released into the surrounding atmosphere. This process helps the plant to regulate its temperature, maintain an optimal turgor pressure within its cells, and obtain vital nutrients from the soil. Considering Fact 1, which states that transpiration is the movement of water vapor from plants into the atmosphere, and Fact 2, which identifies steam as an example of water vapor, it is clear that transpiration involves the movement of steam from plants into the surrounding atmosphere. In other words, when plants undergo transpiration, they release steam (water vapor) into the air, contributing to the water cycle and providing a way for water to travel from the Earth's surface back into the atmosphere. This process plays a crucial role in maintaining the planet's water balance and ensuring that water is distributed throughout ecosystems for the survival and growth of various life forms, including plants, animals, and humans."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The industrial average was first calculated on May 26, 1896. Currently owned by S&P Dow Jones Indices, which is majority owned by S&P Global, it is the most notable of the Dow Averages, of which the first (non-industrial) was first published on February 16, 1885. The averages are named after Dow and one of his business associates, statistician Edward Jones. It is an index that shows how 30 large publicly owned companies based in the United States have traded during a standard trading session in the stock market. It is the second-oldest U.S. market index after the Dow Jones Transportation Average, which was also created by Dow. The \\"Industrial\\" portion of the name is largely historical, as many of the modern 30 components have little or nothing to do with traditional heavy industry. The average is price-weighted, and to compensate for the effects of stock splits and other adjustments, it is currently a scaled average. The value of the Dow is not the actual average of the prices of its component stocks, but rather the sum of the component prices divided by a divisor, which changes whenever one of the component stocks has a stock split or stock dividend, so as to generate a consistent value for the index. Since the divisor is currently less than one, the value of the index is larger than the sum of the component prices. Although the Dow is compiled to gauge the performance of the industrial sector within the American economy, the index's performance continues to be influenced by not only corporate and economic reports, but also by domestic and foreign political events such as war and terrorism, as well as by natural disasters that could potentially lead to economic harm.  - West Germany is the common English name for the Federal Republic of Germany or FRG (or \\"RFA\\") in the period between its creation on 23 May 1949 to German reunification on 3 October 1990.

It occupies a total area of , and its capital and largest city is Addis Ababa.  - The German Autumn was a set of events in late 1977, associated with the kidnapping and murder of industrialist Hanns Martin Schleyer, president of the Confederation of German Employers' Associations (BDA) and the \\"Federation of German Industries\\" (BDI), by the Red Army Faction (RAF) insurgent group, and the hijacking of the Lufthansa airplane \\"Landshut\\" by the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP). They demanded the release of ten RAF members detained at the Stammheim Prison plus two Palestinian compatriots held in Turkey and US15 million in exchange for the hostages. The assassination of Siegfried Buback, the attorney-general of West Germany on 7 April 1977, and the failed kidnapping and murder of the banker Jürgen Ponto on 30 July 1977, marked the beginning of the German Autumn. It ended on 18 October, with the liberation of the \\"Landshut\\", the death of the leading figures of the first generation of the RAF in their prison cells, and the death of Schleyer.  - Kenya, officially the Republic of Kenya, is a country in Africa and a founding member of the East African Community (EAC).

News article: Banks fiddled while Rome burned: how to predict the next global financial crisis A broker reacts at the stock exchange in Frankfurt in September 2008 as world markets responded to the US financial crisis. Photograph: Daniel Roland/AP Looking back, it was easy to see that the crash was coming. There had been too much cheap money. Debt had exploded. Speculation was rife. The gap between rich and poor had widened. Welfare spending had risen. The financial system was so stretched that even a modest tightening of policy was enough to make it impossible for over-borrowed debtors to service their debts. The US in 2007? No, this was imperial Rome during the reign of Tiberius in AD33. It was not the first documented financial crisis; that dubious accolade goes to the states of the Delian League in ancient Greece, which defaulted on their debts following a naval blockade by Sparta. But a time traveller would see remarkable similarities between the unfolding of the Roman crisis of almost two millennia ago and the 2007-09 crash. The calling in of loans led to a credit crunch. Debtors went to the wall. Prices fell. The emperor arranged for the most heavily indebted to get interest-free loans for three years. A \\"bad bank\\" was set up. Tiberius financed his own version of quantitative easing, not by selling imperial bonds but by confiscating wealthy Romans' assets. All of this is documented in an excellent new book by Bob Swarup called Money Mania*, which looks at booms, panics and busts down the ages. His message is that nothing is really new. Put together people, credit and structural fragility and you create the perfect conditions for a crisis. Swarup's book comes out at an opportune moment. The past week has seen a shudder pass through stock markets as investors have taken a closer look at some of the more highly valued technology stocks. Easter traditionally marks the start of the British house-buying season, and this year's begins with sales at a six-year high and prices up almost 10% on a year ago. The appetite for risk was highlighted by the demand for the five-year bonds issued by the Greek government. Inevitably, the talk is of bubbles about to pop, of a new speculative mania, of lessons not learnt. This talk is a bit premature but the warning signs are there. History suggests that certain conditions have to be in place for a crisis to develop. The first is that a decent period of time has to elapse after the previous crash. When bubbles burst, a cavalier approach to risk is replaced, almost instantaneously, by risk aversion. It takes time for those burned by their losses to forget. In the UK, for example, there was a property boom in the early 1970s, another in the late 1980s and a third in the early to mid 2000s. A 15-year gap is the norm. The second condition is a sustained period of solid growth, by the end of which individuals convince themselves that the good times will go on and on. Accordingly, the property boom of the early 1970s came after 25 years of strong growth; the overheated market in the late 1980s stemmed from a belief that Thatcher's reforms had eradicated all the economy's problems; that in the 2000s came amid a period of uninterrupted growth lasting more than 60 quarters. A third crucial factor is belief in those running the show. The runup to the Great Recession of 2007-09 was the heyday of independent central banks, which preened themselves on their ability to deliver solid non-inflationary growth. There were a few, such as Bill White at the Bank for International Settlements, who warned that bubbles could develop in low-inflationary periods, but they were ignored. The public assumed that central banks were fully in control – a misplaced confidence as it turned out. Central banks, no matter how clever, cannot prevent crises. The establishment of the independent Bank of Amsterdam in 1609 did not prevent the tulip mania of the 1630s; the founding of the Bank of England in 1694 was followed a quarter of a century later by the South Sea Bubble. The Wall Street Crash occurred 16 years after the creation of the Federal Reserve. Whip these three ingredients together and you have the recipe for a crisis. As Swarup notes, humans don't like to stand still. \\"Growth is a strong psychological impetus, and if we are not growing in our lives in some way, we feel trapped and miserable.\\" So a recent period of growth plus confidence in policymakers allows us to extrapolate the past into the future, even if that means ignoring inconvenient facts. But more is needed to create the perfect bubble dish. Crises do not occur unless there is an abundance of credit to allow debt to build up and to permit speculators to take ever bigger bets. When economies become saturated with debt, as they were in the mid-2000s, it is time to prepare for the worst. That is certainly the case if complex financial systems are badly flawed. Nobody really understood what the web of banks, hedge funds and shadow banks were up to as they traded credit default swaps and collateralised debt obligations. Regulators certainly didn't. These two final ingredients matter. In the absence of credit and a functioning framework, economies grow only very slowly, as they did in the 1,000 years after the Roman empire collapsed. But too much debt plus poorly managed and regulated financial systems will, sooner or later, lead to trouble. The fact that we are still bubble conscious suggests that the right conditions for a bubble do not yet exist. Insufficient time has passed. Investors are able to differentiate between tech companies that are not making profits and firms in the real economy that do have a track record of earnings growth. In the UK as a whole, house prices have yet to return to their pre-crisis peak, although they have already done so in London. Regulation is still being tightened as policymakers seek to avoid the mistakes of the past. The eurozone is only just emerging from a triple-dip recession and Britain's national output is still lower than it was six years ago. A much longer period of expansion will, on past form, be necessary for the onset of amnesia. All that said, there are a couple of reasons to beware. One is that central banks could leave policy too loose for too long. Dario Perkins, of Lombard Street Research, is one analyst cautioning that if the Fed leaves policy as loose as forecasts suggest, it could create new asset bubbles. The other is that in the age of Facebook and Twitter, only \\"now\\" matters. If we have lost our capacity to remember, trouble may come sooner than we think. *Money Mania: Bob Swarup; Bloomsbury What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"The most important parts of this news article are: 1.

Two neighboring police Departments took different approaches to fighting crime, Greenville P.D. did not invest in DNA testing, improved forensics, and information technology, while Grayville took extensive measures of that nature.  Hint: Law enforcement officers are often unfamiliar with information technology, and so lack the skills and interest in pursuing attackers. There are also budgetary constraints. It has been argued that the high cost of technology, such as DNA testing, and improved forensics mean less money for other kinds of law enforcement, so the overall rate of criminals not getting dealt with goes up as the cost of the technology increases. In addition, the identification of attackers across a network may require logs from various points in the network and in many countries, the release of these records to law enforcement (with the exception of being voluntarily surrendered by a network administrator or a system administrator) requires a search warrant and, depending on the circumstances, the legal proceedings required can be drawn out to the point where the records are either regularly destroyed, or the information is no longer relevant.

Given the following context:  Vita Sackville-West, poet, author, and gardener, was born at Knole, about 25 miles from Sissinghurst, on 9 March 1892. The great Elizabethan mansion, home of her ancestors but denied to her through agnatic primogeniture, held enormous importance for her throughout her life. Sissinghurst was a substitute for Knole, and she greatly valued its familial connections. In 1913 Sackville-West married Harold Nicolson, a diplomat at the start of his career. Their relationship was unconventional, with both pursuing multiple, mainly same-sex, affairs. After breaking with her lover Violet Trefusis in 1921, Sackville-West became increasingly withdrawn. She wrote to her mother that she would like \\"to live alone in a tower with her books\\", an ambition she achieved in the tower at Sissinghurst where only her dogs were regularly admitted. From 1946 until a few years before her death, Sackville-West wrote a gardening column for The Observer, in which, although she never referred directly to Sissinghurst, she discussed a wide array of horticultural issues. In an article, \\"Some Flowers\\", she discussed the challenge of writing effectively about flowers: \\"I discovered this only when I started to do so. Before ... I found myself losing my temper with the nauseating phraseology ... and sickly vocabulary employed.\\" In 1955, in recognition of her achievement at Sissinghurst, \\"bending some stubborn acres to my will\\", she was awarded the Royal Horticultural Society's Veitch Medal. Her biographer Victoria Glendinning considers Sissinghurst to be Sackville-West's \\"one magnificent act of creation\\".  answer the following question:  What is the last name of the person for whom the great Elizabethan mansion held enormous importance throughout the rest of her life?","output":"The last name of the person for whom the great Elizabethan mansion held enormous importance throughout the rest of her life is Sackville-West."}]`),Y={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:W,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},P={class:"search-container"},H={class:"card-container"},E={key:0,class:"empty-state"},D=["disabled"],R={key:0},q={key:1};function j(n,e,h,m,o,s){const p=f("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",P,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),y(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>o.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[w,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):l("",!0)]),t("div",H,[(a(!0),i(b,null,v(s.displayedPoems,(r,g)=>(a(),k(p,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",E,' No results found for "'+d(o.searchQuery)+'".
