This means that over the 24 innings before the 25th, he scored a total of 24A runs. After scoring 95 runs in his 25th innings, his average increases by 3.5 runs to A + 3.5. This means that over 25 innings, he has now scored a total of 25(A + 3.5) runs. We can set up the equation as follows: 24A + 95 = 25(A + 3.5) Now, let's solve for A: 24A + 95 = 25A + 87.5 95 - 87.5 = 25A - 24A 7.5 = A So, the batsman's average before the 25th innings was 7.5 runs.

The tetrahedron rotates around the common edge of these faces. Find the maximum area of the projection of the rotating tetrahedron onto a plane containing the given edge. (12 points)","output":"Let's consider the given problem where we have two adjacent faces of a tetrahedron that are equilateral triangles with side length 3 units. These faces form a dihedral angle of 30 degrees. The tetrahedron is rotated around the common edge of these faces. We need to find the largest area of the projection of the rotating tetrahedron on a plane that contains this common edge. 1. **Area of each triangular face S:**    Since the faces are equilateral triangles with side length 3, the area of one face is calculated as follows:    [    S = frac{sqrt{3}}{4} times (3)^2 = frac{3sqrt{3}}{4}    ]     2. **Projection area when varphi = 0^circ:**    If one face lies flat in the plane of projection, the area of the projection is simply the area of this face:    [    Pi = S    ]     3. **Projection area when 0 < varphi < 60^circ:**    During rotation, as the face gradually tilts away from the plane of projection, the area of the projection of this face is reduced by the cosine of the angle varphi between the face and the plane:    [    Pi = S cos varphi    ]    Since cos varphi < 1 for 0 < varphi < 60^circ, we have:    [    Pi < S    ]     4. **Projection area when 60^circ < varphi < 90^circ:**    In this range, the projection area includes contributions from two faces. The area of the projection in the plane will be the sum of the projections of both faces with angles varphi and psi respectively. Given the constraints, these can be calculated as:    [    Pi = S cos varphi + S cos psi    ]        where psi = pi - frac{pi}{6} + varphi = frac{5pi}{6} - varphi. Hence:    [    Pi = S cos varphi + S cos left( frac{5pi}{6} - varphi right)    ]     5. **Maximization in the interval 60^circ < varphi < 90^circ:**    To find the maxima, we first differentiate Pi with respect to varphi:    [    frac{dPi}{dvarphi} = S (-sin varphi + sin left( frac{5pi}{6} - varphi right) )    ]        Setting the derivative frac{dPi}{dvarphi} = 0 leads us to:    [    -sin varphi + sin left( frac{5pi}{6} - varphi right) = 0    ]        Solving, we find:    [    varphi = frac{5pi}{12}    ] 6. **Evaluation at varphi = frac{5pi}{12}:**    Substituting varphi = frac{5pi}{12} back into our expression for Pi:    [    Pi = S cos left( frac{5pi}{12} right) + S cos left( frac{5pi}{12} right) = 2S cos left( frac{5pi}{12} right)    ]        Since cos left( frac{5pi}{12} right) < cos left( frac{pi}{3} right) = frac{1}{2}, we conclude:    [    2S cos left( frac{5pi}{12} right) < S    ] 7. **Projection area when 90^circ < varphi < 150^circ:**    Beyond 90 degrees, the projection area decreases further and does not contribute to a larger value. At varphi = 150^circ (or frac{5pi}{6} in radians):    [    Pi = S    ] # Conclusion: The maximum projection area is achieved when varphi = 0^circ (or varphi = 180^circ) where a face lies flat in the projection plane: [ boxed{frac{3sqrt{3}}{4}} ]"},{"instruction":"Solve the inequality [dfrac{x+1}{x+2}>dfrac{3x+4}{2x+9}.]","output":"To solve the inequality [dfrac{x+1}{x+2}>dfrac{3x+4}{2x+9},] we first bring all terms to one side to get a single inequality: [frac{x + 1}{x + 2} - frac{3x + 4}{2x + 9} > 0.] This simplifies to [-frac{x^2 - x - 1}{(x + 2)(2x + 9)} > 0,] which can also be written as [frac{x^2 - x - 1}{(x + 2)(2x + 9)} < 0.] To find the critical points, we solve x^2 - x - 1 = 0 to get [x = frac{1 pm sqrt{5}}{2}.] We then create a sign chart for the intervals determined by the critical points and the zeros of the denominator: [ begin{array}{c|ccccc} & x < -frac{9}{2} & -frac{9}{2} < x < -2 & -2 < x < frac{1 - sqrt{5}}{2} & frac{1 - sqrt{5}}{2} < x < frac{1 + sqrt{5}}{2} & frac{1 + sqrt{5}}{2} < x  hline 2x + 9 & - & + & + & + & +  x + 2 & - & - & + & + & +  x - frac{1 - sqrt{5}}{2} & - & - & - & + & +  x - frac{1 + sqrt{5}}{2} & - & - & - & - & +  frac{x^2 - x - 1}{(x + 2)(2x + 9)} & + & - & + & - & + end{array} ] From the sign chart, we see that the inequality frac{x^2 - x - 1}{(x + 2)(2x + 9)} < 0 holds for [x in boxed{left( -frac{9}{2} , -2 right) cup left( frac{1 - sqrt{5}}{2}, frac{1 + sqrt{5}}{2} right)}.]"},{"instruction":"f theta is an acute angle, sin 2theta = a, and cos 2theta = b, calculate the expression sintheta + costheta. **A)** sqrt{(1+b)/2} + sqrt{(1b)/2}   **B)** sqrt{b+1} + sqrt{a+b}   **C)** sqrt{(1+b)/2}  sqrt{(1b)/2}   **D)** sqrt{2a} + b","output":"1. **Express** using double angle identities:    [    sin 2theta = 2sintheta costheta = a quad text{and} quad cos 2theta = cos^2theta - sin^2theta = b    ] 2. **Relate** sintheta and costheta:    [    sin^2theta + cos^2theta = 1    ]    Using squaring method as:    [    x = sintheta + costheta    ]    [    x^2 = (sintheta + costheta)^2 = sin^2theta + 2sinthetacostheta + cos^2theta = 1 + a    ] 3. **Incorporate** cos 2theta into the calculation:    [    cos 2theta = cos^2theta - sin^2theta = b implies cos^2theta - sin^2theta = b    ]     4. **Solve** for both relations:    [    cos^2theta = frac{1+b}{2}, quad sin^2theta = frac{1-b}{2}, quad sinthetacostheta = frac{a}{2}    ]     5. **Estimate** sintheta + costheta:    [    sintheta + costheta = sqrt{(1+b)/2} + sqrt{(1-b)/2}    ] 6. **Conclude**:    [    sqrt{(1+b)/2 + sqrt{(1-b)/2}}    ] The final answer is **A)** boxed{sqrt{(1+b)/2} + sqrt{(1-b)/2}}"},{"instruction":"f 35% of a number is the same as 40% of 50, what is the number?","output":"Let the unknown number be ( x ).

Let's denote the length of the moving train as L (in meters) and its speed as V (in meters per second). When the train passes the pole, it covers a distance equal to its own length (L) in 10 seconds. Therefore, we can write the following equation: L = V * 10 Now, when the train passes the stationary train, it covers a distance equal to the sum of its own length (L) and the length of the stationary train (500 meters) in 35 seconds. We can write this equation as: L + 500 = V * 35 We can now solve these two equations to find the value of V (the speed of the train). From the first equation, we have: L = 10V Substituting this into the second equation, we get: 10V + 500 = 35V Now, we can solve for V: 500 = 35V - 10V 500 = 25V V = 500 / 25 V = 20 meters/second Therefore, the speed of the train is boxed{20}  meters per second."},{"instruction":"Last month, you borrowed some money from your friend.

After his latest visit, he noticed that he had already gone 10 times this month. What will be the date of his third visit next month if he continues going on Wednesdays and Fridays?","output":"1. Vanya visits the swimming pool every Wednesday and Friday. 2. He notes that in the current month, he has visited the pool 10 times, meaning he has gone 5 times on Wednesdays and 5 times on Fridays. 3. We need to determine the date of his third visit in the next month if he continues this schedule. Let's denote the first day of the next month as ( D ). **Case 1: Assuming the first visit in the current month was on a Friday:** 1. The sequence of visits is such that he visited on Fridays and Wednesdays alternately, totaling 10 visits. 2. Thus, the last visit of the month must also fall approximately 5 Wednesdays and 5 Fridays from the first visit. 3. A sequence from first to last visit in days:     - First visit is on a Friday (day 1).     - From the first Friday (day 1) to the last Friday (day 29) inclusively covers 29 days (each visit incrementing by 7 days). 4. Hence, there are 29 days in the sequence in the current month. **Case 2: Assuming the first visit in the current month was on a Wednesday:** 1. The sequence of visits here follows a similar logic but starting with a Wednesday. 2. Thus, the last visit of the month must also fall approximately 5 Wednesdays and 5 Fridays from the first visit. 3. A sequence from first to last visit in days:    - First visit is on a Wednesday (day 1).    - From the first Wednesday (day 1) to the last Wednesday (day 29) inclusively covers 29 days (each visit incrementing by 7 days). 4. Hence, there are again 29 days in the sequence in the current month. Next, we'll calculate the specific dates: 1. Assuming the first Wednesday or Friday falls within a 29-day month, such a month typically ends close to the 30th-31st. 2. Hence, the first Wednesday (or Friday) in the next month aligns precisely with a new month start. We align next month's Wednesdays and Fridays: - First Wednesday will be ( text{Day} = 5(all) ) - Next sequence: Wednesdays of new month: ( 5, 12, 19, 26 ) - Fridays: ( 7, 14, 21, 28 ) Therefore, the **Third Wednesday** is: [ 5 + 7 = 12 ] **Conclusion:** The third visit will be: [ boxed{12} ]"},{"instruction":"Determine the coefficient of the x^2 term in the expansion of left(1frac{1}{x}right)(1+x)^4.","output":"This problem involves finding a specific term and its coefficient in the binomial expansion.

Since (P(X)) has (2n) roots, we can write it as ( P(X) = prod_{i=1}^n (X - a_i)(X - b_i) ). 3. Suppose (n geq 3). We will compare the constant term (coefficient of (X^0)) of the polynomial (P(X)) in two different ways:    - From the original form (P(X) = prod_{i=1}^n (X^2 + X a_i + b_i)), the constant term is (prod_{i=1}^n b_i).    - From the factored form (P(X) = prod_{i=1}^n (X - a_i)(X - b_i)), the constant term is (prod_{i=1}^n (-a_i) cdot prod_{i=1}^n (-b_i) = prod_{i=1}^n a_i cdot prod_{i=1}^n b_i). 4.

The two teachers that have been chosen can go to any of the 3 classes, so we have 3 choices for this step. 3.

The derivative is given by: [ f'(x) = e^x - sin x - (x-1)cos x. ] On the interval -frac{pi}{2} < x < 0, we observe that: - e^x > 0, - -sin x > 0 (since sin x < 0 in this interval), - -(x-1)cos x > 0 (since x-1 < 0 and cos x > 0 in this interval). Therefore, we conclude that f'(x) > 0 for -frac{pi}{2} < x < 0, which implies that f(x) is monotonically increasing on [-frac{pi}{2}, 0]. Thus, option A is correct. **For option B:** We examine the behavior of f'(x) on the interval [-pi, -frac{pi}{2}] to determine the existence of zeros of f(x) on [-pi, 0]. We find that f'(-pi) = e^{-pi} - pi - 1 < 0 and f'(-frac{pi}{2}) = e^{-frac{pi}{2}} + 1 > 0. Since f'(x) is continuous, there exists x_0 in (-pi, -frac{pi}{2}) such that f'(x_0) = 0.  Given that f'(x) changes sign around x_0, f(x) has a local extremum at x_0. Since f(-pi) > 0, f(0) = 1 > 0, and f(x_0) < 0, there must be at least two zeros of f(x) on [-pi, 0], one in (-pi, x_0) and another in (x_0, 0). Therefore, option B is correct. **For option C:** The minimum value of f(x) on [-pi, 0] occurs at x_0, where f'(x_0) = 0. To find the maximum integer k such that f(x) - 2k geqslant 0 for all x in [-pi, 0], we need to estimate f(x_0). Since f(x_0) < f(-frac{pi}{2}) < 0 and f(-frac{pi}{2}) = e^{-frac{pi}{2}} - frac{pi}{2} - 1, we conclude that the maximum integer k is not -3 as suggested, but rather -2 because f(x_0) is greater than -2 - frac{pi}{2}. Thus, option C is incorrect. **For option D:** For 0 < x < 1, we analyze f(x) < e - ln x. By considering the functions u(x) = sin x - x and t(x) = ln x - (x - 1), we find that u(x) is decreasing and t(x) is increasing in this interval. This implies sin x < x and ln x < x - 1. Therefore, f(x) + ln x < e^x - (x-1)^2 + x - 1 < e^x for 0 < x < 1. Since e^x - (x-1)^2 is increasing on (0,1), we have f(x) < e - ln x, making option D correct.

Therefore, we have:    [    CA + CO = CA' + CO = R    ]    This implies that point (C) lies on an ellipse (Gamma) with foci at points (O) and (A). 3. Now consider any point (P neq C) on line ( l ). For point (P):    [    PA + PO = PA' + PO > OA' = R    ]    Therefore, every point on line ( l ), except (C), will satisfy:    [    PA + PO > R    ]    This indicates that point (P) is outside the ellipse (Gamma). 4. Conversely, if point (P) lies on the exterior of ellipse (Gamma), impose (PA) as the semi-major axis. The property:    [    PA + PO > R Rightarrow PO > R - PA    ]    implies that circle centered at (P) with radius (PA) will intersect circle (O) at some point (A'). Construct (AA') with perpendicular bisector intersecting (OA') at (C). This ensures:    [    CA + CO = CA' + CO = R    ]    Hence, point (C) lies on the ellipse (Gamma). 5. To sum up, the set of points we seek is comprised of:    - Points on the ellipse (Gamma)    - Points outside the ellipse (Gamma) # Conclusion: Hence, the set of all points on the crease lines is the set of points inside the ellipse (Gamma) and any point outside the ellipse. This completes the detailed solution to the problem.

We need to show that the circumcircle of the triangle O_A O_B O_C is the same as the circumcircle of the triangle ABC. 2. **Interpretation of the Setup:**    - The incenter I of triangle ABC is the common point from which the incircle (tangent circle to all sides) is drawn.    - O_A, O_B, and O_C are the circumcenters of triangles IBC, ICA, and IAB respectively.    - We need to prove that the circumcircle of triangle O_A O_B O_C is the same as the circumcircle of triangle ABC. 3. **Key Property of Circumcenters:**    - The circumcenter of a triangle is equidistant from all three vertices.     4. **Observation and Analysis:**    To demonstrate this, consider the following:    - For any triangle XYZ, the circumcenter is the point from which all vertices are equidistant.    - In our setup, for triangles IBC, ICA, and IAB, the key observation is how the circumcenters relate to the circumcircle of triangle ABC. 5. **Collinearity via Special Points:**    - We observe that O_A, O_B, and O_C lie on the circumcircle of triangle ABC. This can be seen because of the inherent geometric property tied with the incenter and circumcenters:      - I being the incenter forms a relationship connecting the circumcenters of the sub-triangles to the circumcircle of the main triangle. 6. **Angular and Positional Relationships (using known geometric properties):**    - Notice that in triangle IBC, triangle ICA, and triangle IAB, the circumcenters O_A, O_B, and O_C are each vertices of their respective triangulated circumcircles.    - Due to the incenter and the equidistant properties from ABC, all these centers must lie on a single circle, which aligns with the circumcircle O of triangle ABC in radius determination. 7. **Geometric Conclusion:**    Since all critical points O_A, O_B, and O_C are situated equidistant from I yet influence the same collinearity related to the circumcircle, we conclude:    [    boxed{text{The circumcircle of } triangle O_A O_B O_C text{ is the same as that of } triangle ABC.}    ] 8. **Closure by Circumferential Commitment:**    The geometric properties ensure that the circles concur and hence complete the problem's requirements ensuring all focal points O_A, O_B, and O_C lie on the circumcircle of triangle ABC.

Now, finding the corresponding range of y = 2^x, we look at the minimum and maximum values of x. The minimum value of x is -sqrt{3} - 1 and the maximum is sqrt{3} - 1. The exponential function 2^x is monotonically increasing, which means that the minimum value of y will correspond to the minimum value of x, and the maximum value of y will correspond to the maximum value of x.

If a dragon has more heads than both its neighbors, it is considered cunning; if it has fewer heads than both its neighbors, it is considered strong; the rest (including those standing on the edge) are considered ordinary. In the row, there are exactly four cunning dragons with 4, 6, 7, and 7 heads and exactly three strong with 3, 3, and 6 heads. The first and last dragons have the same number of heads. a) Provide an example of how this could be. b) Prove that the number of heads of the first dragon is the same in all examples.","output":"Part (a): Let's first try to construct an example of how the dragons might be arranged. We need to have exactly 4 \\"clever\\" dragons with 4, 6, 7, and 7 heads, and exactly 3 \\"strong\\" dragons with 3, 3, and 6 heads. Also, the number of heads of the first and the last dragon is the same. We can approach this by arranging the dragons in a sequence graphically, ensuring that the constraints are met as follows: 1. Place a \\"clever\\" dragon between two \\"strong\\" dragons. 2. Ensure the number of heads differs by 1 between neighbors to maintain the sequence. 3. Account for the requirement of clever and strong dragons at specified intervals while maintaining the difference of 1 head between adjacent dragons. Thus, a valid arrangement might be: [5, 4, 5, 6, 7, 6, 7, 8, 6, 5, 4, 5, 3, 4, 3] Here: - Clever dragons: positions 2 (4 heads), 5 (7 heads), 7 (7 heads), 10 (6 heads). - Strong dragons: positions 13 (3 heads), 1 (3 heads), 8 (6 heads).  Part (b): Now, let’s prove that the number of heads of the first dragon is always the same in any valid arrangement of the dragons. Consider the following steps: 1. Think of the row of dragons as a linear function where (f(i)) denotes the number of heads of the ith dragon. 2. Since the neighbors differ by one head, we have (f(i) = f(i-1) pm 1). Let’s start from the general observation: - If a dragon has more heads than both its neighbors, it means ( f(i) = f(i-1) + 1 = f(i+1) + 1 ). - Similarly, if a dragon has fewer heads than both its neighbors, it means ( f(i) = f(i-1) - 1 = f(i+1) - 1 ). We need to identify the clever and strong dragons and calculate the relative conditions. Given that: - Clever dragons: 4 heads, 6 heads, 7 heads, and 7 heads. - Strong dragons: 3 heads, 3 heads, and 6 heads. We also know clever dragons cause an increase or decrease in heads. As we traverse the sequence from left to right: [ ldots 3 - 2 - 3 - ldots ] There must be a transition midpoint from decreasing to increasing number of heads. By symmetry, considering the sum of heads of clever dragons and strong dragons: [ 4 + 6 + 7 + 7 - (3 + 3 + 6) = 12 ] The midpoint value (i.e., where the transition from decreasing to increasing occurs) is thus (12) due to these constraints. Thus, considering all possible arrangements, if we start at normal heads, it suffices to say: [  text{First dragon's heads} = text{Symmetric midpoint} - frac{(C_{clever} - S_{strong})}{2}  = text{Justify the sum and simplify the requirement}. ] We have consistently derived that first heads sum is: [ 5 ]   Thus, the number of heads of the first dragon in all examples must be identical: [  boxed{5} ]"},{"instruction":"The complementary angle of an angle is 54^circ38'.

Thus, the distance to each focus is sqrt{5^2-3^2} = sqrt{25-9} = sqrt{16} = 4. Therefore, the foci have coordinates (pm4, 0). 3. **Assume the Position of the Parabola's Focus**: Without loss of generality, we assume the parabola has its focus at (4,0). Given that its directrix is the line containing the minor axis (the y-axis), the vertex of the parabola is at (2,0). 4. **Derive the Equation of the Parabola**: The general form of the parabola's equation is x = Ay^2 + 2 for some value of A. Since the distance from the vertex to the focus is 2, we have 2 = frac{1}{4A}, leading to A = frac{1}{8}. Thus, the equation of the parabola is x = frac{y^2}{8} + 2. 5. **Solve for the Intersection Points**: To find where the parabola and ellipse intersect, we solve the system of equations:    [begin{aligned}    frac{x^2}{25} + frac{y^2}{9} &= 1,     x &= frac{y^2}{8} + 2.    end{aligned}]    Multiplying the first equation by 9 and the second by 8 and adding them together gives:    [frac{9x^2}{25} + y^2 + 8x = y^2 + 25,]    simplifying to:    [9x^2 + 200x - 625 = 0.]    This quadratic equation factors as:    [(9x-25)(x+25) = 0.]    Since x must be positive (as it represents a physical location on the x-axis), we find x = frac{25}{9}. 6. **Determine the y-coordinates of the Intersection Points**: Substituting x = frac{25}{9} into the parabola's equation, we solve for y:    [frac{25}{9} = frac{y^2}{8} + 2,]    leading to y = pm frac{2sqrt{14}}{3}. 7. **Calculate the Distance Between the Intersection Points**: The distance between the two points is twice the absolute value of the y-coordinate (since they are symmetric about the x-axis), which is 2 times frac{2sqrt{14}}{3} = boxed{frac{4sqrt{14}}{3}}."},{"instruction":"Baron Munchausen claimed that he managed to find a natural number, the product of all the digits of which equals 6552.

[     8 times 9 times 7 times 13 = 6552     ]     - Here, we include 13 as one of the components. 4. **Verification of Digits**:     - The key observation is that, in the decimal system, 13 is not a valid single digit.     - Since digits must be between 0 and 9, the presence of 13 as part of the factorization indicates that some digits exceed the allowable range. 5. **Conclusion**:     - Thus, considering all the above analysis, Baron Munchausen's claim about finding a natural number whose digits multiply to 6552 is false because it requires digits outside the standard 0-9 range.

The midpoint a=6a+k of the line segment k=k+2 can be represented as (frac{x_1 + x_2}{2}, frac{y_1 + y_2}{2}). Next, we'll find the distance | AB | between points k and m. Using the distance formula for two points in a coordinate plane: | AB | = sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^{2} + (y_2 - y_1)^{2}} Since both points k and m lie on the parabola y^{2}=4x, we can substitute y = pm 2sqrt{x} into the equation: | AB | = sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^{2} + (2sqrt{x_2} pm 2sqrt{x_1})^{2}} Now, let's analyze the given line segment k=k+2.

Substitute this into the distance equation: | AB | = sqrt{(2)^{2} + (2sqrt{x_1 + 2} pm 2sqrt{x_1})^{2}} To find the possible values of | AB |, we need to consider two cases: y_2 = y_1 and y_2 = -y_1.

Case 2: y_2 = -y_1 Now, 2sqrt{x_1 + 2} = -2sqrt{x_1}. Solving for x_1, we get x_1 = 2. Consequently, x_2 = 4.

The judge will ask a series of questions and determine who the spy is based on their answers. Here’s the detailed solution to determine the spy's identity: 1. **Initial Conditions:**    - One of A, B, and C is a knight.    - One of them is a liar.    - One of them is a spy. 2. **Judge’s Question to A:**    - Judge asks A: \\"Are you the spy?\\"    - A provides an answer. 3. **Judge’s Question to B:**    - Judge asks B: \\"Is A telling the truth?\\"    - B provides an answer. 4. **Judge's Question to C:**    - Judge asks C: \\"Are you the spy?\\"    - C provides an answer.    - The judge immediately determines who the spy is after C's answer. Let's consider different scenarios to identify who the spy is:  Scenario Analysis: - **Case 1:** If A is the knight, B is the liar, and C is the spy. - **Case 2:** If A is the knight, C is the liar, and B is the spy. - **Case 3:** If B is the knight, A is the liar, and C is the spy. - **Case 4:** If B is the knight, C is the liar, and A is the spy. - **Case 5:** If C is the knight, A is the liar, and B is the spy. - **Case 6:** If C is the knight, B is the liar, and A is the spy. However, we can narrow down the scenarios as follows:  Refined Analysis Based on Statements: - When considering the judge's question to C, let's analyze both possible answers (\\"Yes\\" or \\"No\\"): **If C says \\"Yes\\"**:    - If C were the knight, he cannot say he is the spy because a knight always tells the truth.    - Therefore, C claiming to be the spy must be a lie, implying either C is a liar or a spy.     **If C says \\"No\\"**:    - If C were the liar, it would mean that C cannot truthfully state they are not the spy, causing a logical inconsistency.  Combining All Information: - When the judge ponders C's response, he realizes:   - If C says \\"Yes\\" (i.e., \\"I am the spy\\"), and assuming C is truthful (which he cannot be if he is a spy or liar), the statement would inherently be false due to the nature of knights always telling the truth. Thus C cannot be the knight.   - If C says \\"No\\" (i.e., \\"I am not the spy\\"), this also means C cannot be a liar as liars cannot truthfully admit their true nature. Hence, C must actually be the spy in this scenario. Given the strategic alignment: - C's answer is critical in both scenarios (say 3 and 4), as follows:   - If C answered \\"Yes,\\" judge could conclude C can't be a knight. Further concluding C is the spy precisely due to the inherent contradiction a knight would stand with truth.   - If C answered \\"No,\\" judge could again deduce through logical deduction dictating C betraying answer misalignment towards spy identity.

Now, let's subtract the number of books we already accounted for from the total to find out how many books were borrowed by the 14 students who borrowed at least 3 books: 80 total books - 0 (from 0-book borrowers) - 12 (from 1-book borrowers) - 24 (from 2-book borrowers) = 44 books. These 44 books were borrowed by the 14 students who borrowed at least 3 books. Since we want to find the maximum number of books any single student could have borrowed, we can assume that 13 of these students borrowed the minimum of 3 books each, which would contribute: 13 students * 3 books/student = 39 books. Subtracting these 39 books from the 44 books total for the 3+ book borrowers, we find that the maximum number of books the last student could have borrowed is: 44 books - 39 books = 5 books.

Therefore, in the hyperbola equation, c = 4√3. The absolute difference of the distances from a point on the hyperbola to the two foci is 2, so a = 1. Thus, b^2 = c^2 - a^2 = 47.

We need to demonstrate that among these points, there exists a subset of three points that form a triangle where at least one angle does not exceed 45^circ.  **Step-by-step proof:** 1. **Consider the convex hull:**    If the four points form the vertices of a convex quadrilateral, such as (ABCD), every angle in this quadrilateral is less than 180^circ. Since the sum of the interior angles of a quadrilateral is 360^circ, and there are four such angles, at least one of these angles must be less than or equal to frac{360^circ}{4} = 90^circ. 2. **Dividing into triangles:**    Divide the quadrilateral into two triangles. We need to consider that one of the angles in one of these triangles must be less than or equal to 45^circ.      3. **Join the diagonals:**    Either draw diagonal (AC) or (BD). Consider triangles (ABC) and (ABD). Since ( angle A + angle B + angle C + angle D = 360^circ ) and each of the angles is less than 180^circ, at least one angle must be leq 45^circ.      By the pigeonhole principle, at least one subset of these points will form a triangle where the largest angle is less than or equal to 45^circ. Therefore, we always can pick such three points.

Since the sum of interior angles of a five-sided polygon (pentagon) is (5-2) times 180^circ = 540^circ. 2. **Dividing a pentagon:**    Select diagonals in pentagon to form triangles. For example, draw diagonals creating triangles such as (ABC, ABD, ABE, ACD, ADE, cdots).  3. **Lower bound of angle sums:**    There are (5 choose 3) = 10 triangles, totaling to 30 angles for 10 triangles. Since the 5-sided polygon divides into such triangles with angle sums reaching up to 180^circ times 3 = 540^circ, at least one angle must be leq frac{540^circ}{15} = 36^circ. Thus, among these angles, we will always find at least one angle which is less than or equal to 36^circ. [ boxed{} ]  c) Given six points on a plane, prove that it is always possible to choose three of them to form a triangle with at least one angle that does not exceed 30^circ. **Proof:** Consider six points: ( A, B, C, D, E, F ). **Step-by-step proof:** 1. **Consider the convex hull again:**    Any arrangement of six points on the plane will either form a hexagon or contain some points inside a hexagon formed by some of these points. The sum of angles in a hexagon is (6-2) times 180^circ = 720^circ. 2. **Forming triangles:**    Dividing the hexagon or its sub-triangles with diagonals, there would be (20) angles in (C_6^3 = 20) such triangles. Since the sum of angles of such a hexagon reaches up to 720^circ, there will be at least one angle fulfilling frac{720^circ}{24} = 30^circ. Hence, among all possible combinations, at least one triplet forms a triangle where one of the angles doesn’t exceed 30^circ.

Out of these, we have:    [    text{Total angles (N)} = frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{6} times 3 = frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{2}    ]    Among these total angles, since we are dividing each side by n sum angles, each must be:    [     frac{(n-2) times 180^circ}{n}    ] 3. **Conclude:**    Thus, mathematically, if the points form a counter-clockwise convex hull, the angles are evenly distributed and overall bounded by frac{180^circ}{n}. At least one of these angles will fall within the trim of not exceeding frac{180^circ}{n}. [ boxed{} ]"},{"instruction":"The altitude of an equilateral triangle is 3sqrt{2} units.

For any two distinct such subsets ( A_i ) and ( A_j ), ( 1 ) is in ( A_i cap A_j ), thus:    [    min(A_i cap A_j) = 1 < max A_i, text{ and by construction different from } max A_j.    ]    Thus, ( k_{max} geq 2^{99} - 1 ). 4. **Proof Using Pigeonhole Principle and Induction:**    We demonstrate that ( k geq 2^{99} ) is not achievable by using mathematical induction and the pigeonhole principle. 5. **Base Case for ( n = 3 ):**    Consider ( {1, 2, 3} ). The non-empty subsets are ( {1}, {2}, {3}, {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {2, 3}, {1, 2, 3} ) — a total of 7 subsets. We can group these as:        - Group 1: ( {3}, {1, 3}, {2, 3} )    - Group 2: ( {2}, {1, 2} )    - Group 3: ( {1}, {1, 2, 3} )    By the pigeonhole principle, any 4 non-empty subsets will have at least two subsets in one group. These two subsets will share an element. Therefore, for all choices, we achieve our condition by ensuring at least one common intersection element. 6. **Induction Step:**    Assume the conclusion holds for ( n ), where ( n geq 3 ).    Consider ( n+1 ) and set ( S = {1, 2, cdots, n+1} ). If we have ( 2^n ) subsets of ( S ):    - If at least ( 2^{n-1} ) subsets exclude ( n+1 ), we retain our conclusion for sets of size ( n ) under induction hypothesis.    - If fewer than ( 2^{n-1} ) include ( n+1 ), at least ( 2^{n-1} + 1 ) subsets include ( n+1 ). Remove ( n+1 ) from these, yielding at least ( 2^{n-1} + 1 ) subsets in ( {1, 2, cdots , n} ). 7. **Applying Pigeonhole Principle:**    The ( 2^{n-1} ) subsets can be partitioned such that at least two subsets are complements. These subsets meet the intersection requirement with the new element ( n+1 ).    Thus, the induction step is verified. 8. **Final Conclusion:**    Combining our findings and the induction step, the largest ( k ) such that the condition of the problem is satisfied is:    [    k = 2^{99} - 1    ] [ boxed{2^{99} - 1} ]"},{"instruction":"For points ( A_{1}, ldots, A_{5} ) on the sphere of radius 1, what is the maximum value that ( min _{1 leq i, j leq 5} A_{i} A_{j} ) can take?

Thus, the maximum value that (min_{1 leq i < j leq 5} A_i A_j) can take is (sqrt{2}). [ boxed{sqrt{2}} ]"},{"instruction":"Socorro is preparing for a math contest.

Since Socorro needs to train for a total of 5 hours for the contest, we need to convert this total time into minutes because we have the time spent on multiplication in minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 5 hours is: 5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 300 minutes in total. Now, we subtract the time spent on multiplication from the total training time to find out how much time is spent on division problems: 300 minutes (total) - 100 minutes (multiplication) = 200 minutes on division problems.

This is because the number must include at least two factors of 2 (to be a multiple of 4), at least one factor of 5 (to be a multiple of 5), and all prime factors must appear to an even power (to be a perfect square).

We will break this proof into the following scenarios for clarity: 1. **Point is a Vertex of the Polyhedron**:     - Let us consider a point on the surface of the polyhedron that is a vertex.      - A vertex is a point where multiple edges meet, and in a regular polyhedron, all vertices are equivalent (symmetric).     - When we rotate the polyhedron around an axis passing through its center and this vertex, it will carry the polyhedron into itself due to its symmetry.      - Thus, one possible axis of rotation is through the vertex and the polyhedron's center. 2. **Point Lies on an Edge of the Polyhedron (but not a Vertex)**:     - Consider a point on the edge of the polyhedron that is not a vertex.     - This point divides the edge into two equal parts. When we rotate the polyhedron around this axis (passing through its center and this midpoint), the edge swaps its position with itself; thus, the structure of the polyhedron is preserved.     - Therefore, this point must be the midpoint of the edge, ensuring symmetric rotation by 180^{circ}.            Furthermore, since the polyhedron is regular, all edges are equivalent and exhibit this symmetry. So, the axis passing through the midpoint of an edge and the center is another valid axis of rotation. 3. **Point Lies on a Face of the Polyhedron (but not on an Edge)**:     - Finally, let us consider a point that lies on a face of the polyhedron but not on its edges.     - Each face of the polyhedron is symmetric. If we choose the center of a face, the entire face can rotate around the axis passing through the polyhedron's center and the center of this face.     - This will map the face onto itself, preserving the entire polyhedron’s structure.     - Consequently, this point must be the center of a face, resulting in symmetrical rotation. In conclusion, each of these scenarios - the vertex, the midpoint of an edge, and the center of a face - shows that any axis of rotation passes through the center and one of these three points on the surface of a regular polyhedron. Hence, we conclude the proof.

Each of the k rectangles has exactly four corners. Hence, we can write the total number of corners considering all rectangles as:    [    4k    ] 3. Points in sets B and C are shared among rectangles:    - Points in B are counted twice, so we subtract b,    - Points in C are counted four times, so we subtract 3c.

This line segment is one of the potential geometrical loci of the center of circle C'. 5. **Geometric Locus 2**: Another necessary condition is that circle C' must pass through points A and B. Therefore, the center of circle C' must also lie on the perpendicular bisector of the segment AB.  6. **Intersection of Loci**: The center of circle C' must be at the intersection of these two loci:     - The perpendicular segment from O through M.     - The perpendicular bisector of AB. 7. **Construction**:     - Draw the perpendicular from O to l and mark the intersection as P. From P, draw the perpendicular line (this is the first locus).     - Draw the perpendicular bisector of segment AB (this is the second locus).     - The point where these two lines intersect is the center O' of the required circle C'. 8. **Drawing Circle C'**: With center O' and radius O'A (or O'B), draw the circle C'. Conclusion: The circle C' thus constructed will pass through points A and B and will intercept a chord from the given circle C that is parallel to the given line l. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"f the square roots of a positive number are 3a and 2a+1, then the positive number is ______.","output":"Given that the square roots of a positive number are 3-a and 2a+1, we can set up an equation based on the property that the sum of the roots of a quadratic equation equals the negative coefficient of the x term divided by the coefficient of the x^2 term. However, in this context, it's more straightforward to understand that if 3-a and 2a+1 are square roots of the same number, their squares should be equal. But the problem seems to imply a different approach, suggesting we consider these as roots of a polynomial equation. Let's correct the interpretation to align with the given solution: Given the square roots are 3-a and 2a+1, for them to be roots of the same number, we mistakenly consider adding them. The correct approach, aligning with the provided solution, involves recognizing a mistake in the interpretation. The provided solution actually solves for a by setting the sum of the roots equal to zero, which is not the standard approach for finding a number given its square roots. The correct approach should involve equating the square of the roots to the number. However, to follow the given solution closely: 1. The equation given is 3-a+2a+1=0. 2. Simplifying this equation, we get a+4=0. 3. Solving for a, we find a=-4. Given a=-4, we substitute a back to find the positive number: 1. The positive number is (3-a)^2. 2. Substituting a=-4 into the equation, we get (3-(-4))^2. 3. Simplifying inside the parenthesis, we get (3+4)^2. 4. Which simplifies further to 7^2. 5. Finally, calculating 7^2 gives us 49.

Let's denote angle MF_1F_2 as theta. Since F_2A bisects angle MF_2F_1, we have angle AF_2F_1 = angle MF_2A = theta. This also means that angle F_1F_2M = angle F_1MF_2 = angle MAF_2 = 2theta. From the geometry of the situation, |AF_1| = |AF_2| because F_2A bisects angle MF_2F_1, and this distance equals |MF_2| = 2a - 2c. This leads us to conclude that |AM| = 4c - 2a. Considering the similar triangles triangle MF_1F_2 and triangle MF_2A, we compare their sides: [ frac{|MF_2|}{|F_1F_2|} = frac{|AM|}{|MF_2|} ] Substituting the known distances: [ frac{2a - 2c}{2c} = frac{4c - 2a}{2a - 2c} ] Simplifying leads to c^2 + ac - a^2 = 0.

The length of the other train is approximately 290.04 m. What is the speed of the second train?","output":"To find the speed of the second train, we first need to determine the relative speed at which the two trains cross each other. Since they are moving in opposite directions, we add their speeds to find the relative speed. The speed of the first train is given as 120 km/hr. We need to convert this speed into meters per second (m/s) because the time taken to cross is given in seconds and the length of the trains is given in meters. To convert km/hr to m/s, we use the conversion factor: 1 km/hr = 1000 m / 3600 s = 5/18 m/s So, the speed of the first train in m/s is: 120 km/hr * (5/18) m/s/(km/hr) = (120 * 5) / 18 m/s = 600 / 18 m/s = 33.33 m/s The total distance covered when the two trains cross each other is the sum of their lengths: 210 m + 290.04 m = 500.04 m The time taken to cross each other is given as 9 seconds. Now, we can use the formula for relative speed (V_rel) and the time (t) to find the distance (d): V_rel = d / t We know d = 500.04 m and t = 9 s, so: V_rel = 500.04 m / 9 s ≈ 55.56 m/s This relative speed is the sum of the speeds of both trains. We already know the speed of the first train in m/s (33.33 m/s), so we can find the speed of the second train (V_2) by subtracting the speed of the first train from the relative speed: V_2 = V_rel - V_1 V_2 = 55.56 m/s - 33.33 m/s ≈ 22.23 m/s Now, we convert the speed of the second train back to km/hr: V_2 (km/hr) = V_2 (m/s) * (18/5) km/hr/(m/s) V_2 (km/hr) ≈ 22.23 m/s * (18/5) km/hr/(m/s) ≈ 399.14 km/hr Therefore, the speed of the second train is approximately boxed{399.14}  km/hr."},{"instruction":"Find the smallest natural number B that satisfies the equation 360÷(A×A×A/B)=5.","output":"Let's denote the smallest natural number B as b.

To do this, we need to factorize 72 to find its prime factors: 72 = 2³ × 3² For A³ to be divisible by 72, A must be divisible by both 2 and 3. The smallest natural number divisible by both 2 and 3 is their least common multiple (LCM), which is 6 (since 6 = 2 × 3).

The starting and ending points are distinct vertices (Berge).","output":"To prove that a matching ( M ) in a graph ( G ) is maximal if and only if there is no augmenting path with the given properties, we can proceed with the following steps: 1. **Initial Assumption:**    Assume there exists a path in ( G ) with the following properties:    - From each pair of consecutive edges on this path, one belongs to the matching ( M ), and the other does not.    - The path starts and ends at vertices not covered by edges in ( M ).    - The start and end vertices are distinct. 2. **Construction of Path:**    Since neither the start nor the end vertices have matching edges, the path consists of an odd number of edges, which can be denoted as:    [    v_{1}v_{2}, v_{2}v_{3}, ldots, v_{2n-1}v_{2n}    ] 3. **Modifying the Matching:**    Construct a new matching ( M' ) by:    - Removing the edges of ( M ) on the path ( {v_{2}v_{3}, v_{4}v_{5}, ldots} ).    - Adding the edges not in ( M ) on the path ( {v_{1}v_{2}, v_{3}v_{4}, ldots} ). 4. **Size of the New Matching:**    Clearly, ( M' ) contains one more edge than ( M ) because the number of added edges is greater than the removed edges by one. This contradicts the assumption that ( M ) is a maximal matching. Therefore, if ( M ) is maximal, such a path cannot exist in ( G ). --- Next, consider the converse direction: 5. **Suppose ( M ) is Maximal:**    Now assume there are two matchings ( M ) and ( M' ), where ( M' ) has more edges than ( M ). 6. **Constructing the Path:**    Identify a path or alternating cycle that uses edges of both matchings ( M ) and ( M' ). Specifically, consider the edges used in one and not in the other:    [    {M in E text{ and } M' notin E} cup {M' in E text{ and } M notin E}    ]    Any path formed by such edges must alternate between an edge in ( M ) and an edge in ( M' ). 7. **Maximal Path:**    Evaluate all such alternating paths that cannot be extended. For any such path:    - It must contain a longer match from ( M' ) since ( M' ) has more edges than ( M ).    - Hence, this path also adheres to the properties where the path starts and ends on vertices not in ( M ), and alternates edges between ( M ) and non-( M ). 8. **Contradiction and Conclusion:**    This path inherently fulfills the conditions given in the problem's properties (1), (2), and (3), contradicting the assumption that ( M ) is a maximal matching if such a path existed. Therefore, the non-existence of such a path verifies that ( M ) must be maximal. Thus, we have shown both directions of the statement.

We can perform operations that change the signs of subsets of these vertices in a specific manner. We need to prove certain statements about these operations for specific values of n and derive a general form for the maximum number of distinct configurations for any n, denoted as K(n). 2. **Initial Observations**:     For a regular n-gon, each of the n vertices can independently be assigned +1 or -1. Thus, there are a total of 2^n possible configurations. 3. **Definition of \\"Equivalent\\" Configurations**:     Two configurations are considered \\"equivalent\\" if one can be transformed into the other by a sequence of allowable operations. The allowable operations involve changing the signs of vertices that form a smaller polygon within the larger n-gon. 4. **Case I: n = 15**:     - The number 15 can be factored into prime components as 15 = 3 times 5.     - We can change the signs of vertices of polygons that are multiples of 3 or 5. That means the 15-gon is divided into 5 triangles (3-gons) and 3 pentagons (5-gons).     - There are 5 triangles and 3 pentagons, resulting in 8 such polygons.     - Each configuration within these polygons can be altered independently of others.     - This leads to 2^8 = 256 configurations equivalent to a given configuration, which is less than the 2^{15} total possible configurations, hence not all configurations can be transformed to one another.     - So, the number of inequivalent configurations is at least 2^{15} - 2^8. 5. **Case II: n = 30**:     - The number 30 factors into primes as 30 = 2 times 3 times 5.     - We can change the signs of vertices that form smaller polygons (2-gons, 3-gons, or 5-gons).     - Hence, this 30-gon can be divided into smaller polygons: 15 2-gons, 10 3-gons, and 6 5-gons.     - There are 15+10+6-8 = 23 independent smaller polygons, resulting in 2^{23} configurations equivalent to a given configuration.     - This is less than the total 2^{30} possible configurations, confirming not all configurations can be transformed to one another. 6. **General Case for Any n**:     - Given any natural number n, factorize n as n = p_1^{alpha_1} p_2^{alpha_2} cdots p_s^{alpha_s}, with p_i as distinct primes.     - Define q = p_1 p_2 cdots p_s and m = frac{n}{q}.

The product of any number and a multiple of 5 will end in 0 or 5. 2. For the product to be odd, the other factor (the odd number) must be odd, because an even number times any number will result in an even product. 3. Since the product must be less than 1000, the largest multiple of 5 we can use is 195 (because 200 * 5 = 1000, which is not less than 1000). Let's find the odd multiples of 5 less than 1000: 5, 15, 25, ..., 195 To find the number of terms in this sequence, we can use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence: a_n = a_1 + (n - 1)d Where: - a_n is the nth term - a_1 is the first term - n is the number of terms - d is the common difference In this case, a_1 = 5, d = 10 (since we're skipping every even multiple of 5), and a_n = 195. We want to find n: 195 = 5 + (n - 1)10 190 = (n - 1)10 19 = n - 1 n = 20 So there are 20 odd multiples of 5 less than 1000. Now, each of these odd multiples of 5 can be written as the product of 5 and another odd number (since 5 itself is odd). For example, 15 = 5 * 3, 25 = 5 * 5, etc. Since we are looking for unique products, we don't need to consider different odd factors that would result in the same product (for example, 5 * 15 and 15 * 5 are the same product, 75).

Combining these two pieces of information, we can determine the fraction of students who began the contest and were still in it after the second round. Since frac{1}{2} of the students remained after the first round and then frac{1}{3} of those made it through the second round, we multiply these fractions to find the overall fraction of students who were still in the contest after both rounds: frac{1}{2} cdot frac{1}{3} = frac{1}{6} This means that frac{1}{6} of the students who began the contest were still in it after the second round.

If two-thirds of the mangoes were unripe, then one-third were ripe. Since Jordan picked 54 mangoes in total, we can calculate the number of ripe mangoes as follows: Ripe mangoes = 1/3 of total mangoes Ripe mangoes = 1/3 * 54 Ripe mangoes = 18 Now, we know that two-thirds were unripe, so: Unripe mangoes = 2/3 of total mangoes Unripe mangoes = 2/3 * 54 Unripe mangoes = 36 Jordan kept 16 unripe mangoes, so the number of unripe mangoes given to his sister is: Unripe mangoes given to sister = Total unripe mangoes - Unripe mangoes kept by Jordan Unripe mangoes given to sister = 36 - 16 Unripe mangoes given to sister = 20 Jordan's sister can make 5 jars of pickled mangoes, and it takes 4 mangoes to fill a jar, so she needs: Mangoes needed for 5 jars = Number of jars * Mangoes per jar Mangoes needed for 5 jars = 5 * 4 Mangoes needed for 5 jars = 20 Since the number of unripe mangoes given to his sister (20) matches the number of mangoes needed for 5 jars (20), all the unripe mangoes given to his sister were used for pickling. Now, we want to find the ratio of ripe mangoes to the total mangoes picked: Ripe mangoes : Total mangoes 18 : 54 To simplify the ratio, we can divide both numbers by their greatest common divisor, which is 18 in this case: (18/18) : (54/18) 1 : 3 So, the ratio of ripe mangoes to the total mangoes picked is boxed{1:3} ."},{"instruction":"David obtained some marks in English, 98 in Mathematics, 99 in Physics, 100 in Chemistry, and 98 in Biology.

So we can write the equation as: 0.06 * P * 32,000 + 0.12 * 0.40 * 15,000 = 1104 Now we can solve for P.

Then, we have:    [    sum_{i neq j} S(i,j) = (n-1) sum_{i,j} a_{i,j} = (n-1)n^3    ]    There are ( frac{n(n-1)}{2} ) such pairs of rows. Therefore, by the pigeonhole principle, for some pair ( (i,j) ), the sum of the entries in the corresponding rows is at least:    [    frac{(n-1)n^3}{frac{n(n-1)}{2}} = 2n^2    ] 2. **Sum of Entries in Columns:**    For the pair of rows ( (i,j) ) identified above, we now consider the sums of entries in pairs of columns. We claim that for some pair of columns ( (k,l) ), the sum of the entries in the ( 2 times 2 ) subarray formed by rows ( i,j ) and columns ( k,l ) must be more than ( 3n ).    Suppose, for contradiction, that for every pair of columns ( (k,l) ), the sum of the entries in the ( 2 times 2 ) subarray is at most ( 3n ). Let ( T(k,l) ) denote the sum of the 4 entries in the rectangle formed by rows ( i,j ) and columns ( k,l ). Then:    [    T(k,l) leq 3n quad forall k neq l    ] 3. **Summing Over All Pairs of Columns:**    Consider the sum:    [    sum_{k neq l} T(k,l)    ]    This sum is at least ( (n-1)(2n^2) ) because each term of the rows ( i,j ) is counted ( n-1 ) times, so the sum is ( (n-1)S(i,j) ). On the other hand, each such term is at most ( 3n ), and there are ( frac{n(n-1)}{2} ) such terms. Therefore:    [    sum_{k neq l} T(k,l) leq 3n cdot frac{n(n-1)}{2} = frac{3n^2(n-1)}{2}    ] 4. **Contradiction:**    Comparing the two expressions, we get:    [    (n-1)(2n^2) leq frac{3n^2(n-1)}{2}    ]    Simplifying, we obtain:    [    2 leq frac{3}{2}    ]    This is a contradiction, as ( 2 ) is not less than or equal to ( frac{3}{2} ). Therefore, our assumption that for every pair of columns ( (k,l) ), the sum of the entries in the ( 2 times 2 ) subarray is at most ( 3n ) must be false. Thus, there exists at least one ( 2 times 2 ) subarray with a sum of elements greater than ( 3n ).

Since g(x) is increasing for 0 < x < 1 and decreasing for x > 1, it reaches its maximum at x=1, where g(1) = 0. Therefore, g(x) leq 0 for all x > 0, which means {f'}(x) leq 0 for all x > 0.

Consider the smallest sequence of distinct natural numbers: (a_1 = 1, a_2 = 2, a_3 = 3, ldots, a_{10} = 10). 4. Compute the LCM, denoted as (N), of (1, 2, 3, ldots, 10):     [     text{LCM}(1, 2, 3, ldots, 10) = 2520     ] 5. Since (a_4) in this sequence is (4), the ratio (N / a_4) equals:     [     frac{2520}{4} = 630     ] Thus, the minimum value ( N / a_4 ) can take is: [ boxed{630} ]  Part (b): 1. Identify the minimum possible value for (N / a_4), which we found to be 630. 2. We need to determine all possible values of (a_4) on the interval ([1, 1300]) such that (N) divided by (a_4) gives the minimum value. 3. For a number sequence containing up to (a_4), maintaining (N) as low as possible, consider multiples of each smaller number set. 4. Construct sequences whose LCM is a multiple ending with values fitting within the specified interval and providing the ratio matching the minimum result. 5. (N) up to (a_4 = 4) in smallest numbers:     - Option 1: (a_1 = 1, a_2 = 2, a_3 = 3, a_4 = 360), minimum LCM = 2520     - Option 2: Adding higher multiples consistently, (e.g. 720 or 1080 fits in similar consistent least multiple values) 6. Repeating these constructed consistent multiple addition preserving LCM logic and fitting the ratio results yields the provided potential valid (a_4) values:     [     360, 720, 1080     ] Thus, the possible values of (a_4) such that (N / a_4) is its minimal value are: [ boxed{360, 720, 1080} ]"},{"instruction":"The distances from point ( X ) on side ( BC ) of triangle ( ABC ) to lines ( AB ) and ( AC ) are ( d_{b} ) and ( d_{c} ), respectively.

The total amount (A) is the sum of the principal (P) and the simple interest (SI): A = P + SI Given: A = Rs. 8510 R = 6% per annum T = 9 years We can express SI in terms of P, R, and T: SI = (P × R × T) / 100 Now, we can substitute SI in the total amount equation: A = P + (P × R × T) / 100 Plugging in the given values: 8510 = P + (P × 6 × 9) / 100 8510 = P + (54P) / 100 8510 = P + 0.54P 8510 = 1P + 0.54P 8510 = 1.54P Now, we can solve for P: P = 8510 / 1.54 P = 5525.97 (approximately) Therefore, Mr. Karan borrowed approximately Rs. boxed{5526} ."},{"instruction":"Given the function f(x) = mx^3 + nx^2, the graph of f(x) has a tangent line at the point (1,2) that is parallel to the line 3x + y = 0.

How much does the paint cost per gallon?","output":"First, let's calculate the cost of the primer after the 20% discount. The original price of the primer is 30.00 per gallon. A 20% discount on 30.00 is calculated as follows: 20% of 30.00 = (20/100) * 30.00 = 6.00 So, the discount on each gallon of primer is 6.00, which means the discounted price per gallon is: 30.00 - 6.00 = 24.00 Blake needs to buy a gallon of primer for each of the 5 rooms, so the total cost for the primer is: 24.00 * 5 = 120.00 Now, we know that Blake spends a total of 245 on both paint and primer. If we subtract the total cost of the primer from this amount, we can find out how much he spends on paint: 245.00 - 120.00 = 125.00 Blake spends 125.00 on paint. Since he needs a gallon of paint for each of the 5 rooms, we can find the cost per gallon of paint by dividing the total cost of paint by the number of gallons: 125.00 / 5 = 25.00 Therefore, the paint costs boxed{25.00}  per gallon."},{"instruction":"Given the circle (x4)^{2}+(y5)^{2}=169, a line passing through the point (1,1) intersects the circle at points A and B.

The next step involves analyzing the line that passes through the point (1,1) and intersects the circle at points A and B. The distance from the circle's center (4,5) to the point (1,1) is a crucial component in determining the range of |AB|. The distance, d, can be found as follows: [ d = sqrt{(4-1)^{2}+(5-1)^{2}} = sqrt{3^{2}+4^{2}} = sqrt{9+16} = sqrt{25} = 5 ] To find the range of |AB|, we consider two scenarios: the minimum distance and the maximum distance between A and B. The chord AB is perpendicular to the radius at its midpoint, creating a right-angled triangle with the radius as the hypotenuse and half the chord length as one of the sides. For the minimum value of |AB|, we use Pythagoras' theorem, where 13 is the length of the hypotenuse and 5 is the distance from the center to the midpoint of AB: [ begin{align*} 13^{2} &= 5^{2} + left(frac{|AB|}{2}right)^{2}  169 &= 25 + left(frac{|AB|}{2}right)^{2}  left(frac{|AB|}{2}right)^{2} &= 144  frac{|AB|}{2} &= 12  |AB| &= 24 end{align*} ] Thus, the minimum value of |AB| is 24.

Let ( f(x^n) ) be positive reducible. This means that ( f(x^n) ) can be written as a product of two nonconstant polynomials with positive real coefficients.

Suppose that in one of the polynomials on the right-hand side (for example, ( h_1(x) )), there exists a term like ( ax^k ) such that ( n nmid k ). This means that ( k ) is not a multiple of ( n ). 3. Consider the term ( ax^k cdot h_2(0) cdot h_3(0) cdot ldots cdot h_m(0) ) in the expansion of the right-hand side. Since all the coefficients are positive, this term will not vanish and will remain in the expansion. 4. However, this leads to a contradiction because the exponents of the terms in the left-hand side ( f(x^n) ) are all multiples of ( n ). Therefore, there cannot be a term ( ax^k ) with ( n nmid k ) in any of the ( h_i(x) ). 5. Hence, each ( h_i(x) ) must be of the form ( g_i(x^n) ) where ( g_i(x) ) is a polynomial with positive real coefficients. Therefore, we can write:    [    h_i(x) = g_i(x^n)    ] 6.

We will show that this is the smallest possible side length that can contain five unit circles without any two circles having a common interior point. 2. **Assume a Smaller Square**: Assume there exists a square (ABCD) with side length (x), where (x < 2 + 2sqrt{2}), that can contain five unit circles ((O_1), (O_2), (O_3), (O_4), (O_5)) of radius 1, such that no two circles have a common interior point. 3. **Construct Inner Square**: Construct a smaller square (EFGH) inside (ABCD) with side length (x-2). The distances between the sides of (EFGH) and (ABCD) are 1 unit each. This means that the circles must be completely inside (EFGH) because if any circle were outside (EFGH), it would not be completely inside (ABCD). 4. **Divide Inner Square**: Divide the square (EFGH) into four equal smaller squares. Each smaller square has a side length of (frac{x-2}{2}). 5. **Apply Pigeonhole Principle**: By the Pigeonhole Principle, at least one of these four smaller squares must contain at least two of the five circle centers (O_1, O_2, O_3, O_4, O_5). Without loss of generality, assume that (O_1) and (O_2) are inside the smaller square (EIML). 6. **Distance Between Centers**: Since the circles ((O_1)) and ((O_2)) do not have a common interior point, the distance between their centers must be at least 2 units, i.e., (O_1O_2 geq 2). 7. **Maximum Distance in Smaller Square**: The maximum distance between any two points inside the smaller square (EIML) is the length of its diagonal, which is (sqrt{2} cdot frac{x-2}{2}). Therefore, (O_1O_2 leq sqrt{2} cdot frac{x-2}{2}). 8. **Derive Contradiction**: Since (x < 2 + 2sqrt{2}), we have:    [    sqrt{2} cdot frac{x-2}{2} < sqrt{2} cdot sqrt{2} = 2    ]    This implies (O_1O_2 < 2), which contradicts the requirement that (O_1O_2 geq 2). 9. **Conclusion**: Therefore, the assumption that (x < 2 + 2sqrt{2}) is false.

Recall that:    begin{align}    sqrt{1 - 2sintheta costheta} &= sqrt{(costheta - sintheta)^2} tag{since (costheta - sintheta)^2 = 1 - 2sintheta costheta}     &= |costheta - sintheta|    end{align}        and        begin{align}    sqrt{1 + 2sintheta costheta} &= sqrt{(costheta + sintheta)^2} tag{since (costheta + sintheta)^2 = 1 + 2sintheta costheta}     &= |costheta + sintheta|    end{align}     4. Therefore, the original expression simplifies to:    begin{align*}    sqrt{1 - 2sintheta costheta} - sqrt{1 + 2sintheta costheta} &= |costheta - sintheta| - |costheta + sintheta|    end{align*}     5. Given the interval for theta, analyze the values of costheta and sintheta:     begin{align*}     text{For } theta inleft[frac{5pi}{4}, frac{3pi}{2}right] &:     end{align*}     begin{itemize}       item theta lies in the third quadrant where costheta < 0 and sintheta < 0.       item Thus, costheta - sintheta > 0 and costheta + sintheta < 0.    end{itemize}    6. Consequently, we have:    begin{align*}    |costheta - sintheta| &= -(costheta - sintheta) = sintheta - costheta & text{(since costheta - sintheta > 0)}     |costheta + sintheta| &= costheta + sintheta & text{(since costheta + sintheta < 0)}    end{align*} 7. Substituting these values into the simplified form:    begin{align*}    |costheta - sintheta| - |costheta + sintheta| &= (sintheta - costheta) - (costheta + sintheta)     &= sintheta - costheta - costheta - sintheta     &= -2costheta    end{align*} 8.

Since we have three segments (let's call them A, B, and C), each symmetry must map segment A to either A, B, or C. 3. **Symmetries involving different segments:**    Analyze the symmetry properties:    - There can be at most two symmetry transformations that map one segment to another distinct segment. For any given segment, there are at most two other segments it can be mapped to by symmetrical transformations. 4. **Maximum number of symmetries:**    Therefore, considering the entire setup and accounting for all segments under symmetry operations, there can be up to six distinct symmetry operations. This is because each segment can be translated or reflected into another, generating a total of six symmetries, encompassing all possible configurations of the three segments. 5. **Example:**      An illustrative example is given by considering three segments that form the diagonals of a regular hexagon. A regular hexagon has exactly six axes of symmetry, corresponding to:      - Three axes passing through opposite vertices.    - Three axes passing through the midpoints of opposite sides.

Can the company make a total profit of 35 million yuan over the two years? If yes, find the selling price of the product in the second year; if not, explain the reason.","output":"# Step-by-Step Solution  Part 1: Function Relationship between y and x Given the table, we can observe that for each increase of 1 yuan in the selling price, the annual sales volume decreases by 1 ten thousand units. This linear relationship can be represented as:  y = 120 - (x - 30) times 1  Simplifying the equation, we get:  y = -x + 150  Therefore, the function relationship between y and x is y = -x + 150, with the range of values for x being 30 leqslant x leqslant 70.  Part 2: Profitability in the First Year and Optimal Selling Price Let's denote the company's profit in the first year as w (in million yuan). The profit can be calculated as:  w = y(x - 20) - 250 - 50  Substituting the relationship y = -x + 150, we get:  w = (-x + 150)(x - 20) - 300  Expanding and simplifying, we find:  w = -(x - 85)^2 + 1225  This quadratic equation represents a parabola opening downwards, indicating the maximum profit occurs at the vertex (85, 1225). However, since 30 leqslant x leqslant 70, the maximum profit within the permissible range occurs at x = 70. Substituting x = 70 into the profit equation:  w_{text{max}} = 1000  Therefore, the company is profitable in the first year, and the maximum profit of 1000 million yuan is achieved when the selling price is 70 yuan per item.  Part 3: Total Profit Over Two Years For the total profit over two years to be 35 million yuan, the equation becomes:  (-x + 150)(x - 20) - 500 = 3500 - 1000  Simplifying, we get:  -(x - 85)^2 + 1225 = 0  Solving this quadratic equation, we find x = 120 or x = 50. Given the constraint 30 leqslant x leqslant 70, the valid solution is x = 50. Therefore, to achieve a total profit of 35 million yuan over two years, the selling price in the second year should be 50 yuan per item. # Final Answers 1.

We need to prove that the necessary and sufficient condition for ( OM perp MN ) is that ( S, N, T ) are collinear. 2. **Restating the Condition:**    The condition ( OM perp MN ) implies that the quadrilateral ( OMTN ) is cyclic. This is because if ( OM ) is perpendicular to ( MN ), then ( angle OMN = 90^circ ), which is a property of a cyclic quadrilateral where one of the angles is ( 90^circ ). 3. **Cyclic Quadrilateral Property:**    For ( OMTN ) to be cyclic, the opposite angles must sum to ( 180^circ ).

Each side of the square has 3 triangles attached to it. 3. **Identifying the Smallest Convex Polygon S**:    - The smallest convex polygon S that contains R is a regular hexagon. This is because the outermost points of the triangles form a hexagonal shape. 4. **Calculating the Area of R**:    - The area of the unit square is 1.    - The area of one equilateral triangle is frac{sqrt{3}}{4} (since the area formula for an equilateral triangle is frac{sqrt{3}}{4} s^2 where s is the side length).    - There are 12 such triangles, so the total area of the triangles is 12 times frac{sqrt{3}}{4} = 3sqrt{3}.    - Therefore, the area of R is 1 + 3sqrt{3}. 5. **Calculating the Area of S**:    - The side length of the hexagon S is 2 units (since it extends 1 unit beyond the square on each side due to the triangles).    - The area of a regular hexagon is given by frac{3sqrt{3}}{2} s^2.

This is represented as follows:    [    underbrace{text{(color 2), (color 3), (color 2), (color 3), ldots, (color 2, color 3)}}_{text{odd number of squares}}    ]        Since we started with color 2 and alternated, the ending square will also need to be color 2, making it adjacent to another square of the same color. 4. **Conclusion from the Alternation Issue:**    Since it is impossible to alternate colors correctly with an odd number of squares with the given constraints, this specific configuration demonstrates that not all arrangements can be properly 3-colored without violating the given conditions. 5. **Generalization and Conclusion:**    This contradiction shows that there exist configurations (such as the one described) where it is impossible to color the squares with only three colors while meeting the criteria that no two adjacent squares share the same color. Hence, it is not always possible to color the squares as Ivan claims. Thus, Arseni is correct in asserting that it is not always possible to achieve the required coloring with only three colors.

Start by considering the fraction (frac{9}{10}):    [    frac{9}{10} = frac{3}{6} + frac{2}{5}    ]        This step simply rewrites (frac{9}{10}) as the sum of (frac{3}{6}) and (frac{2}{5}). 2. Next, we need to express (frac{2}{5}) using denominators that are powers of 6. We start by rewriting (frac{2}{5}) in a more convenient form:    [    frac{2}{5} = frac{2}{6} cdot frac{6}{5}    ]        Here, we multiply and divide by 6 to facilitate the subsequent steps. 3.

Substituting this series into our expression for (frac{2}{5}) gives:    [    frac{2}{5} = frac{2}{6} left( 1 + frac{1}{6} + frac{1}{6^2} + frac{1}{6^3} + ldots right)    ] 7.

Consider a regular 27-sided polygon (denoted by P_{27}). The vertices of P_{27} lie on a circumscribed circle. 2. Among the chords determined by the vertices of P_{27}, there are 13 distinct lengths (since for a n-sided polygon, the number of distinct chord lengths is given by leftlfloor frac{n-1}{2} rightrfloor). 3. Let S be any set of 7 vertices chosen from P_{27}. Each vertex of S is on the circle, resulting in chords of the circle determining the sides and diagonals of a 7-sided polygon formed by these points. 4. The number of sides and diagonals (i.e., chords) for the 7-sided polygon is given by the binomial coefficient:     [     binom{7}{2} = 21     ]      5. Since each chord is one of the 13 possible distinct lengths, and there are 21 chords, by the pigeonhole principle, at least 8 of these chords must share a length with at least one other chord (since 21 - 13 = 8). 6. If any two pairs of vertices have equal chord lengths between them, we can form a trapezoid. This is illustrated by the two scenarios:     - Case 1 (Figure 1): If two pairs of chords, say PA = PA_1 and PB = PB_1, have the same length, then the quadrilateral AA_1B_1B forms a trapezoid.     - Case 2 (Figure 2): If a vertex P connects to another vertex pair having equal lengths PA = PA_1 and PB = PB_1, we again form a quadrilateral AA_1B_1B, which is a trapezoid.      7. To confirm that such cases always exist, consider if all distances are distinct. Given the 21 chords, each distinct distance could occur at most twice (namely PA and PA_1, or PB and PB_1 for a maximum of 13 different lengths). 8. However, by design, having more vertices than distinct chord lengths guarantees repetitions, as explained in the pigeonhole principle. Therefore, without losing generality, repetitions force at least one occurrence of the configurations illustrated (either from Case 1 or Case 2). 9. Since a 27-sided regular polygon ensures repetition of chord lengths, the conditions are inevitable, which leads to the conclusion that among any 7 chosen vertices, there will always be a subset of 4 vertices forming a trapezoid. # Conclusion: Therefore, in a regular 27-sided polygon, any set of 7 vertices will always contain four vertices that form a trapezoid. boxed{text{Done}}"},{"instruction":"acute (triangle ABC), (a), (b), and (c) are the sides opposite to angles (A), (B), and (C) respectively, and it is given that (sqrt{3}a = 2csin A).

What time will they take to cross each other if they are running in opposite directions?","output":"When two trains are running in the same direction, their relative speed is the difference between their speeds. So, the relative speed of the two trains is: 60 kmph - 40 kmph = 20 kmph To convert this speed into meters per second, we use the conversion factor 1 kmph = 5/18 m/s: 20 kmph * (5/18) = (20 * 5) / 18 = 100 / 18 ≈ 5.56 m/s Now, let's denote the length of each train as L meters. Since the trains are of equal length, the total distance they need to cover to cross each other is 2L meters. We know that they take 50 seconds to cross each other, so we can use the formula: Distance = Speed * Time 2L = 5.56 m/s * 50 s 2L = 278 meters So, the length of each train (L) is: L = 278 meters / 2 = 139 meters Now, when the trains are running in opposite directions, their relative speed is the sum of their speeds: 60 kmph + 40 kmph = 100 kmph Converting this speed into meters per second: 100 kmph * (5/18) = (100 * 5) / 18 = 500 / 18 ≈ 27.78 m/s The distance they need to cover to cross each other is still 2L (since the length of the trains hasn't changed), which is 278 meters. Using the formula again: Distance = Speed * Time 278 meters = 27.78 m/s * Time Time = 278 meters / 27.78 m/s Time ≈ 10 seconds So, the trains will take approximately boxed{10}  seconds to cross each other when running in opposite directions."},{"instruction":"an run 3 kms in 3 min 18 sec and b can run same distance in 3 min 40 sec , then by how much distance a can beat b ?","output":"To determine by how much distance A can beat B, we first need to calculate the speed of both A and B, and then use that information to find out how much farther A would run in the time it takes B to complete the 3 km.

In each move, we can take 2 pies from any one plate and distribute them to the two adjacent plates.

This invariant is an essential property. 5. **Arguing Parity**:    - To get 2 pies on every plate, we must have ( P_B = P_W = 20 ). Thus, each would contribute 20 pies. 6. **Verification by Counting**:    - Suppose initially ( P_B ) is even, and ( P_W ) must then be even because ( P_B + P_W = 40 ) and sum of two numbers can only be even if both are even or both are odd.    - If ( P_B ) is odd, then ( P_W ) will be odd as well.    - For ( P_B - P_W ), this invariant parity difference means the configuration requires proviso that both ( P_B ) and ( P_W ) need to be even.     7. **Example of Failure**:     - Start with 41 pies, initially configured such that ( 20 ) pies are on black and ( 21 ) are on white. Initially, parity suggest incompatible even total with odd distribution which fails the parity conservation. 8. **Conclusion of Impossibility**:    - If our initial condition starts with an odd number for pie total distributed over colored plates restrict getting to an even distribution set goal.

It is now the second player’s turn:           - (1 + 2 = 3) (Sum is divisible by 3)         - If the first writes \`2\`, the second should write \`1\`:           - (2 + 1 = 3) (Sum is divisible by 3) 6. **Analysis by Example**:     - Suppose the first series of moves resulting in the digits are (1, 2, 1, 2, x), where \`x\` should makes non-divisible by 3:         - Summing the digits: (1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + x = 6 + x).         - To prevent the sum from being divisible by 3, the 5th cell must make (6 + x) non-divisible by 3. 7. **Conclusion**:     - No matter what the first player writes in the last cell, the second player successfully maneuvered earlier turns to ensure the sum modulo 3 leads to non-divisible by 3 scenario.

Now, we need to find a lower bound for (frac{b_{n+1}}{b_1 + b_2 + cdots + b_n}). Using the inequality:    [    b_{n+1} geq sqrt{sum_{k=1}^{n} frac{b_k^2}{k^3}},    ]    we can write:    [    frac{b_{n+1}}{b_1 + b_2 + cdots + b_n} geq frac{sqrt{sum_{k=1}^{n} frac{b_k^2}{k^3}}}{b_1 + b_2 + cdots + b_n}.    ] 7.

Since (sum_{k=1}^{n} frac{1}{k^3}) converges to a constant, we have:    [    b_{n+1} geq sqrt{C}.    ] 9.

Consider two equilateral triangles ABC and A'B'C' inscribed in the same circle, with the same circumradius.

The key step in this proof involves rotating the entire configuration by 120^circ around the center O of the circle. In such a rotation:    - Point A will move to the position of point B.    - Accordingly, points B, C, A', B', and C' will also move to new positions corresponding to the 120^circ rotation. 4.

The only geometric figure that can be rotated by 120^circ about its center and map onto itself is an equilateral triangle. Hence A_1B_1C_1 must be an equilateral triangle. 8.

This scenario cannot be possible as we have two sets of incompatible dimensions for the rectangle's sides. Since we are looking for a consistent set of side lengths for a rectangle, and considering that the distances to the sides must be perpendicular to those sides, it is evident that the sides must be 4 and 6 (as the distance to one shorter side is 1 and to the adjacent longer side is 2, the remaining lengths would be 3 and 4, respectively, due to the rectangle's right angles). Therefore, the shorter sides of the rectangle are 4 units long, and the longer sides are 6 units long.

Continuing this pattern, we see that each step involves adding a small fraction and subtracting an even smaller fraction. Eventually, this sequence will converge to ( frac{1}{2} ). 6.

We know that the total number of tickets sold is 320, so we can write the following equation: V + G = 320 We also know the total revenue for the night was 7,500, and we can write an equation for the revenue based on the types of tickets sold and their respective discounts: Revenue = (30 * 0.9X) + (20 * 0.85X) + (V - 30 - 20) * X + (40 * 0.9Y) + (50 * 0.8Y) + (80 * 0.95Y) + (G - 40 - 50 - 80) * Y Simplifying the revenue equation: Revenue = (27X) + (17X) + (V - 50) * X + (36Y) + (40Y) + (76Y) + (G - 170) * Y Now, we know the revenue is 7,500, so: 7,500 = (44X) + (V - 50) * X + (152Y) + (G - 170) * Y We also know the number of VIP and General Admission tickets sold from the given information: VIP tickets sold = 30 (early bird) + 20 (group rate) + (V - 30 - 20) General Admission tickets sold = 40 (early bird) + 50 (group rate) + 80 (student discount) + (G - 40 - 50 - 80) Now, let's calculate the number of VIP and General Admission tickets sold: VIP tickets sold = 30 + 20 + (V - 50) = V General Admission tickets sold = 40 + 50 + 80 + (G - 170) = G We know that V + G = 320, so we can solve for V or G.

We need to prove that this sequence includes at least one number whose digit sum is divisible by 11. 1. Let ( m ) be the smallest number in this range with its last digit being a zero. Note that the number ( m ) has the form ( 10k ) for some natural number ( k ). 2. Consider the numbers ( m, m+10, m+20, ldots, m+30 ). We observe that these numbers have their last digits as ( 0, 0, 0, 0 ) respectively. 3. Let ( S(m) ) represent the sum of the digits of ( m ). Then, we have ( S(m+10) = S(m) + 1 - 9 ) if the preceding digit is not a carry, and so on. 4. Generally, the sum of the digits of the number ( m+10i ) can be given by:    [    S(m+10i) equiv S(m) + i pmod{11}    ]    This formula helps us understand the sequence shift by each increment of 10. Since we increment by 10, each increment affects only one digit of ( m ). 5. To ascertain that at least one of these sums is divisible by 11, note the sequence of sums ( S(m), S(m+10), S(m+20), S(m+30) ). 6. The digit sums ( S(m), S(m+10), S(m+20), S(m+30) ) form an arithmetic progression modulo 11:    [    S(m), S(m) + 1, S(m) + 2, S(m) + 3    ]    where each step advances the digit sum relative to 11. 7. Among any four successive numbers ( S(m), S(m) + 1, S(m) + 2, S(m) + 3 mod 11 ), there must be at least one number that is congruent to 0 modulo 11. This is due to the pigeonhole principle, as the four numbers must cover all residues modulo 11 among each group of 11. 8. Therefore, one of ( S(m), S(m+10), S(m+20), S(m+30) ) must be equivalent to 0 modulo 11. 9. Since ( m leq n+9 ), the sequence ( m, m+1, ldots, m+30 ) is fully contained within ( n, n+1, ldots, n+38 ). This shows that the sequence from ( n ) to ( n+38 ) includes at least one number whose digit sum is divisible by 11. # Conclusion: At least one of the numbers in any sequence of 39 successive natural numbers will have a digit sum that is divisible by 11: [ boxed{text{True}} ]"},{"instruction":"At a restaurant, they served hot dogs at 3 meals today: breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

The scores above 120 are in the tail of the distribution, which is less than the area between 110 and 120. Therefore, the percentage of students scoring above 120 is less than 15%. Given there are 60 students in the class, and assuming a conservative estimate that approximately 15% of these students score above 120, we calculate 0.15 times 60 = 9 students.

Consider the first square and the second square. Let's denote the first square as ABCD and the second square as A'B'C'D'. The sides of these squares are parallel, implying that the rotation of one square about a certain point (M) can be analyzed. 2. Rotate the first square ABCD around the point M by 60^circ (clockwise or counterclockwise). For the triangle MPQ to be equilateral, point Q must be located at a position such that, either by direct rotation or reflection, the entire first square remains within the second square. 3. The second square A'B'C'D' will contain the first square ABCD entirely if, after a 60^circ rotation, all vertices of ABCD are still within A'B'C'D'. For this to happen, the locus of such points M can be derived by ensuring that, upon rotation, the edges of the smaller square do not extend beyond the confines of the larger square. 4.

However, to explore the upper bound within the city constraints, consider that moving Vasya to a distance far from a cluster of friends yields a multiplied distance effect. 9. **Configuration**:     Suppose all friends except Vasya live in the same city different from Petya's.

Therefore, statement B is incorrect. **Statement C:** For z=a+ai with a in mathbb{R}, if a=0, z is 0 (neither purely real nor purely imaginary). If a neq 0, z has both real and imaginary parts. Thus, z cannot be purely imaginary. Therefore, statement C is incorrect. **Statement D:** Let z=a+bi with a,b in mathbb{R}. Given z^{2}=3+4i, we have: [(a+bi)^{2}=a^{2}-b^{2}+2abi=3+4i] This leads to the system of equations: [left{begin{array}{l} a^{2}-b^{2}=3 2ab=4 end{array}right.] Solving this system, we find left{begin{array}{l}a=2b=1end{array}right. or left{begin{array}{l}a=-2b=-1end{array}right.. This means the point corresponding to z is in the first or third quadrant. Therefore, statement D is correct. Hence, the correct statements are A and D.

Thus, (1) is not included. 3. **Considering Prime Numbers**:    Let ( p ) be a prime number. A prime number by definition has no divisors other than (1) and itself. If ( p ) is represented as the product of several natural numbers, one of the numbers must necessarily be ( p ) itself, and the others must be (1):        [    p = p times 1 times 1 times cdots times 1    ]        However, the sum of these numbers would be:        [    p + 1 + 1 + cdots + 1    ]        Clearly, this sum is greater than ( p ), hence prime numbers cannot be represented in this way. 4. **Considering Composite Numbers**:    Let ( n ) be a composite number, which means it can be factored into natural numbers other than (1). Suppose ( n = a times b ) where ( a, b geq 2 ) (since (1) is excluded as a factor for this context). We must check if ( n ) can be the sum of these factors possibly adjusted by ones to meet the required expression.        [    n = a times b    ]        For the sum to equal ( n ), consider the equation:        [    a + b leq a times b    ]        Simplifying to find a logical way forward:        [    (a - 1)(b - 1) geq 1    ]        Since ( a geq 2 ) and ( b geq 2 ), the product term ( (a-1)(b-1) ) is non-zero and positive:        [    (a-1)(b-1) geq 1 implies ab geq a + b    ]        Therefore, adding necessary (1)'s to ( a ) and ( b ), we can form a set of natural numbers whose product and sum both equal ( n ). For instance, let:        [    text{Sum} = a + b + 1 + 1 + cdots = n    ]        This approach works for composite numbers. 5. **Conclusion**:    Based on the above steps, prime numbers and the number (1) cannot be represented as both a sum and a product of the same set of natural numbers, but every composite number can.

If triangle ABF_2 is an isosceles right triangle with angle ABF_2 as the vertex, then the square of the eccentricity of the hyperbola is (    ).

Since triangle ABF_2 is an isosceles right triangle with angle ABF_2 as the vertex, we know that angle F_2AB = 45^circ. 2. The slope of the line l passing through F_1 and A is given by frac{y_A - 0}{x_A + ae} = tan(45^circ) = 1. Since A lies on the hyperbola, it satisfies the equation frac{x_A^2}{a^2} - frac{y_A^2}{b^2} = 1. 3. Solving the slope equation for y_A in terms of x_A gives us y_A = x_A + ae. Substituting this expression into the hyperbola equation yields frac{x_A^2}{a^2} - frac{(x_A + ae)^2}{b^2} = 1. 4. Simplifying and solving the equation from step 3 for x_A, we find x_A = frac{-a^2e + bsqrt{a^2e^2 + 2a^2}}{a^2 + b^2}. Since A and B have the same y-coordinate, we can use the distance formula to find the length of AB: AB = 2x_A. 5. Now, we can find the length of F_2B using the Pythagorean theorem: F_2B = sqrt{(ae - x_A)^2 + y_A^2}. Since triangle ABF_2 is isosceles, F_2B = AB. 6. Equating these expressions and squaring both sides to eliminate the square root, we obtain (ae - x_A)^2 + y_A^2 = 4x_A^2. Simplifying and solving for e, we find e = sqrt{2 + frac{b^2}{a^2}}. 7. The problem asks for the square of the eccentricity, so we have e^2 = 2 + frac{b^2}{a^2}. Since the hyperbola's equation is given in the standard form, we know that b^2 = a^2(e^2 - 1). Substituting this expression into our equation for e^2, we obtain e^2 = 2 + (e^2 - 1), which simplifies to e^2 = 3. 8. However, none of the answer choices match this result. Upon re-examining the problem, we notice that the given hyperbola equation has a positive x^2 term and a negative y^2 term, indicating that it opens left and right. This means that F_1 and F_2 should have been assigned as (ae, 0) and (-ae, 0) respectively, instead of (-ae, 0) and (ae, 0). 9.

This will guarantee the conditions:    - Columns: Since we only cut one tree per 2 times 2 quadrat positioned at (2i, 2j), this maximizes the possible number of trees cut while avoiding visibility from one stump to another. 5. **Calculation**:    Therefore, by cutting down one tree per each of the 2500 quadrats while ensuring no two stumps are aligned horizontally or vertically within any one quadrat, it is possible to cut down exactly 2500 trees:    [    2500 text{ trees cut}    ] Conclusion [    boxed{2500} ]"},{"instruction":"Given f(x) is an even function, and f(4) = 3, then the value of f(4) + f(4) is.","output":"Since f(x) is an even function, it follows that f(4) = f(-4),   Therefore, f(4) + f(-4) = 2f(4) = 6.

Additionally, a richer millionaire cannot stay in a room with fewer stars than a less wealthy one. In how many ways can they be allocated given that the state of wealth for all millionaires is pairwise different?","output":"To solve this problem, we need to determine how to distribute 13 millionaires into 3 different categories: 6-star, 7-star, and 8-star hotel rooms, such that each category has at least one millionaire, and the wealthiest millionaires stay in the rooms with the most stars. Since each millionaire has different wealth and we must ensure each type of room is used, we must break down the possible combinations while respecting the condition that wealthier individuals stay in rooms with more stars. This is a problem of combinatorial selections. We are given that there are (13) millionaires, and we need at least one millionaire in each type of room (6-star, 7-star, and 8-star). This means we need to split the 13 millionaires into three non-empty groups. Here's a more structured step-by-step detailed solution: 1. **Assign One Millionaire to Each Room Type**:     Assign one of the 13 millionaires to each room type to ensure each type is represented:    - 1 in 6-star, 1 in 7-star, 1 in 8-star.    This leaves us with (13 - 3 = 10) millionaires to further distribute. 2. **Calculate Number of Ways to Distribute Remaining Millionaires**:    We need to distribute the remaining 10 millionaires among the 3 types of rooms. This problem can be reduced to counting the number of ways we can partition 10 into three groups (since each room type already has 1 person, the groups must be non-empty). 3. **Use Stars and Bars Method**:    The number of ways to partition (10) items into (3) non-empty groups is found using the stars and bars theorem adjusted for non-empty groups.    According to the formula for stars and bars:    [    text{The number of ways } = binom{n-1}{k-1}    ]    where ( n ) is the number of items to partition, and ( k ) is the number of groups.    Here ( n = 10 ), ( k = 3 ):    [    binom{10 - 1}{3 - 1} = binom{9}{2}    ] 4. **Calculate the Binomial Coefficient**:    Now, calculate the binomial coefficient:    [    binom{9}{2} = frac{9!}{2!(9-2)!} = frac{9!}{2! cdot 7!} = frac{9 times 8}{2 times 1} = 36    ] 5. **Accounting for Initial Selection**:    Since our initial selection of first 3 millionaires can be any of the 13 chosen in ( binom{13}{3} ) ways. However, since we are considering only single combination of specific 3 assigned set initially. Thus the final number of distinct ways to assign the remaining 10 millionaires among 3 rooms:    (Steps illustration for simplicity by initial simplification, the interpretation might appear rather directly for constraint respected): (boxed{36})    Hence, the correct interpretation within constraint we shall intervene as final boxed valued as per logic if sanitizer validated:    (boxed{36})."},{"instruction":"Xunzi said: Without accumulating small steps, one cannot reach a thousand miles; without accumulating small streams, one cannot form a river and sea.

If ( n = p^l ) for prime ( p ) and ( l geq 2 ), the circular arrangement of its divisors would force the number 1 to always be adjacent to ( p ), which does not satisfy our prime-related criteria (1 divides ( p ) is not a prime relation). 7. **Examples of Good Numbers:**    Consider ( n = p^a q^b ), where ( p ) and ( q ) are distinct primes, and ( a ) and ( b ) are positive odd integers.

If selling a kite for Rs. 30 gives the shopkeeper a gain of 25%, we can find the cost price (CP) using the formula: Selling Price (SP) = Cost Price (CP) + Gain Given that Gain = 25% of CP and SP = Rs. 30, we can write: 30 = CP + (25/100 * CP) 30 = CP + 0.25 * CP 30 = 1.25 * CP CP = 30 / 1.25 CP = Rs. 24 Now, during the clearance sale, the shopkeeper allows a discount of 10% on the marked price. The marked price (MP) is the price before any discount, which in this case is the original selling price of Rs. 30. Discount = 10% of MP Discount = 10/100 * 30 Discount = Rs. 3 So, the selling price during the sale (SP_sale) is: SP_sale = MP - Discount SP_sale = 30 - 3 SP_sale = Rs. 27 Now, let's calculate the gain percent during the sale: Gain during sale = SP_sale - CP Gain during sale = 27 - 24 Gain during sale = Rs. 3 Gain percent during sale = (Gain during sale / CP) * 100 Gain percent during sale = (3 / 24) * 100 Gain percent during sale = 0.125 * 100 Gain percent during sale = 12.5% So, the shopkeeper's gain percent during the clearance sale is boxed{12.5%} ."},{"instruction":"The medians of triangle (ABC) intersect at point (O).

Specifically, we want to show that ( f(x+y, -y, z+y, u, v) - f(x, y, z, u, v) < 0 ). Given that during the adjustment process ( x - z = (x+y) - (z+y) ) remains unchanged, and ( f ) is nonnegative, it is beneficial to include ( (x-z)^2 ) in ( f ). By symmetry of the vertices, it is advantageous to include the squared differences for each pair of separated vertices, yielding the function [ f(x, y, z, u, v) = (x-z)^2 + (y-u)^2 + (z-v)^2 + (u-x)^2 + (v-y)^2. ] Let's analytically investigate the function ( f ) and its change:  Suppose ( y < 0 ).

The descending sequence of strictly decreasing positive integers must terminate after a finite number of steps when all the numbers at the vertices are positive integers.

Given that the sides of the rhombus are 51 units each and one of the diagonals is 48 units, we can work with one of these right triangles where the sides adjacent to the right angle are half the length of the diagonals. 1. Let's denote the half-length of the shorter diagonal as 24 units (since the full length is 48 units, and it's bisected by the rhombus). 2. The Pythagorean theorem tells us that in a right triangle, the sum of the squares of the legs is equal to the square of the hypotenuse.

Moving symmetrically across the axis, we place the symmetric point Q 2 units to the right of the axis of symmetry, at x=1+2=3. Therefore, Q has coordinates (3,y_{1}). 3. **Analyze the Behavior of the Function**: Since a=-1 < 0, the parabola opens downwards.

To demonstrate this, let's consider the reverse process: starting with several single-stone heaps, repeatedly combine two heaps until only one remains, ensuring the similarity condition is preserved. 1. **Initial Setup**: Assume initially we have n heaps, each containing a single stone. Every heap is of size 1. 2. **Combination Process**: We will iteratively combine the two smallest heaps into one larger heap.  3. **Heap Combination Rule**: Suppose we are combining two heaps of sizes x and y with x leq y. The new combined heap will have size x + y. 4. **Check Size Similarity**: The condition that the new heap size must be similar to the larger of the two combined heaps means:    [    x + y leq 2y    ]    This inequality always holds since x leq y by definition. Therefore, the new heap's size is always at most double the size of the largest heap involved in the combination. 5. **Iterative Process**: Continue this combination process until only one heap remains. Given that each combination step adheres to the size similarity condition, this ensures that at no point do the heaps differ by more than a factor of two. 6. **Final Heap Size**: If the combining process starts with n heaps each of size 1, and in each step two heaps are merged, each combination step reduces the total number of heaps by one:    [    text{Number of steps} = n - 1    ]    After n - 1 steps, we have one heap of size n. Hence, starting from n single-stone heaps, it is possible to form one heap of size n by combining heaps in a manner that ensures all intermediate steps produce heaps that differ in size by no more than a factor of two. This proves that any initial collection of stones can indeed be split into heaps differing by no more than a factor of two. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"Prove that if K is even, then the numbers from 1 to K1 can be arranged in such an order that the sum of any consecutive numbers is not divisible by K.","output":"1. **Define the sequence and the constraints:**    - We are given that ( K ) is even, hence ( K = 2L ) for some integer ( L ).    - Our goal is to arrange the numbers from ( 1 ) to ( K-1 ) such that no sum of consecutive numbers is divisible by ( K ). 2. **Construct the specific sequence:**    - Arrange the numbers such that odd numbers are in descending order and placed in odd positions, while even numbers are in ascending order and placed in even positions.

Therefore, the number of monochromatic colorings of any k-term progression is:      [      2^n times frac{2}{2^k} = 2^n cdot frac{2}{2^k}      ] 6. **Subtract the monochromatic ones from all colorings.**    - The total number of colorings of the set {1, 2, ldots, n} is 2^n, so the number of colorings where no k-term arithmetic progression is monochromatic is at least:      [      2^n - A left(2^n cdot frac{2}{2^k}right)      ] 7. **Simplify the inequality.**    - Rewriting, we get:      [      2^n - frac{n^2}{2(k-1)} cdot 2^n cdot frac{2}{2^k}      ]      [      = 2^n left(1 - frac{n^2}{(k-1) 2^k}right)      ] 8. **Verify the condition.**    - Given that n^2 < (k-1) 2^k, or equivalently n < sqrt{(k-1) 2^k}, ensures that:      [      1 - frac{n^2}{(k-1) 2^k} > 0      ]      This inequality means that the expression 2^n left(1 - frac{n^2}{(k-1)2^k}right) is positive. # Conclusion: Therefore, there exists at least one coloring of {1, 2, ldots, n} such that no k-term arithmetic progression is monochromatic.

Since they are moving towards each other, we add their speeds together. Relative_Speed_After_Stops = Speed_A2 + Speed_B2 = 50 mph + 40 mph = 90 mph Now we can calculate the time it will take for the trains to meet after their stops using the remaining distance and the relative speed. Time_After_Stops = Remaining_Distance / Relative_Speed_After_Stops Time_After_Stops = 50 miles / 90 mph To convert hours to minutes, we multiply by 60.

It asks for the distance from the focus of the parabola to the asymptotes of the hyperbola. This problem tests knowledge of the standard equations of parabolas and hyperbolas, as well as basic geometric properties. It is a fundamental problem. Using the standard equation of the parabola, we find the focus of the parabola to be F(1, 0). From the standard equation of the hyperbola, we find the equations of its asymptotes to be y = pmsqrt{3}x, which can be rewritten in general form as sqrt{3}x pm y = 0. We can then use the distance formula between a point and a line to find the requested distance. **Solution**: Given the parabola equation y^2 = 4x, we have 2p = 4, hence frac{p}{2} = 1, so the focus of the parabola is F(1, 0). Given the hyperbola equation x^2 - frac{y^2}{3} = 1, we have a^2 = 1 and b^2 = 3, hence a = 1 and b = sqrt{3}. The equations of the asymptotes of the hyperbola are y = pmfrac{b}{a}x, which simplifies to y = pmsqrt{3}x. Rewriting this in general form gives sqrt{3}x pm y = 0.

The sum of an arithmetic series can be found using the formula: S_n = n/2 * (a_1 + a_n) where a_n is the last term. Since the even numbers increase by 2 each time, the 50th even number would be 2 + (50 - 1)*2 = 100.

We need to consider both scenarios to determine the strategic path for Alice. 4. **Scenario 1: Alice writes (8)**:     - Bob's subsequent move must be writing (10):       [       8 + 2 = 10       ]     - Alice writes (12):       [       10 + 2 = 12       ] 5. **Scenario 2: Alice writes (9)**:     - Bob's subsequent move must be writing (12):       [       9 + 3 = 12       ] 6. **Observations from both scenarios**:     - In both scenarios, the board eventually reaches (12). 7. **Critical Step**:     - Once the board shows the number (12), the game is in a critical state. From number (12), let's observe what happens:         - If it’s Alice’s turn (from the first scenario), she can choose not to be the one forced to write a number exceeding (2023^{2023}).         - Conversely, if it’s Bob’s turn (from the second scenario), Alice has maneuvered so that Bob always ends up at the critical juncture where the number would exceed (2023^{2023}). 8. **Conclusion**:     - Given the forced progression and the ability to control the influential number (12):       - Alice can always position the game such that either she wins directly by forcing Bob to write (2023^{2023} + 1) or more, or ensure she is not left with a losing move.     - Therefore, Alice can always win the game with the correct strategic plays.

We need to determine the minimum number of elements in set ( A ). 3. Note that:     - An odd function ( f(x) ) satisfies ( f(-x) = -f(x) ) and thus passes through the origin if defined there.     - A function that is increasing on (-infty, infty) may or may not be odd.     - Consider overlap:         - If a function is both an odd function and its graph passes through the origin, it contributes to both counts.         - Similarly, if a function is both increasing and passes through the origin, it contributes to both counts. 4.

Since each pairwise intersection of the sets (i.e., ( |O cap I|, |I cap P|, |O cap P| )) and their triple intersection (i.e., ( |O cap I cap P| )) cannot be determined directly without additional information, we approximate by looking at the largest possible overlap:     - At least the maximum number of unique functions when overlap is minimized because each function must be included at least once. 8. Specifically:    [    max(|O|, |I|, |P|) = max(10, 8, 12) = 12    ]     Adding non-overlapping unique contributions:     - ( |O| - |O cap P| approx 10 - 8 = 2 )     - ( |I| - |I cap P| approx 8 - 6 = 2 ) 9.

The tangents to (omega_B) at (B) and to (omega_C) at (C) intersect at a point (Y) on the (A)-symmedian of (triangle ABC). 3. **Proof of Lemma:**    - Define (f_B: X to BX) as a mapping from (AM) to the pencil of lines through (B), preserving cross-ratios.    - Define (g_B: BX to BY) as a mapping from the pencil of lines through (B) to itself, preserving cross-ratios since (angle (BY, BX) = angle (BA, XA) = text{const}).    - The composition (h_B = g_B circ f_B) preserves cross-ratios.    - Similarly, define (h_C: X to CY) which also preserves cross-ratios.    - The composition (h = h_B circ h_C^{-1}) is a projective mapping from the pencil of lines through (C) to the pencil of lines through (B).    - Since (h(BC) = BC), the locus of points (CY cap h(CY) = Y) is a line.    - For (X = X_1 = AM cap omega), (omega_B = omega_C = omega), and (Y) is the intersection of tangents through (B) and (C) to (omega), which lies on the symmedian.    - For (X = X_2 = M), (angle BYC = 180^circ - angle YCB - angle YBC = 180^circ - angle YAB - angle YAC = 180^circ - angle CAB), implying (Y in omega).    - Thus, (angle MAC = angle MCY = angle BCY = angle BAY), and (AY) is the symmedian. 4. **Application to the Problem:**    - Let (F) be the midpoint of (BD). Due to symmetry, (omega) and (Omega) pass through (F).    - Applying the lemma to (triangle AED) and the circles (omega) and (Omega), we get that (EP) is the symmedian of (triangle AED).    - Therefore, (angle (DE, EP) = angle (EF, EC) = angle (DC, CE)), implying that (PE) is tangent to (Omega).

Since k is a prime number, it has exactly two positive divisors, 1 and k. Thus:          a_1 = d(a_0) = d(k) = 2          - For n geq 1, we have:          a_{n} = d(a_{n-1}) = d(2) = 2          - Thus, {a_n} becomes a constant sequence starting from a_1, i.e., a_n = 2 for all n geq 1.     - Clearly, 2 is not a perfect square. 4. **Necessity**:     - Suppose k is not a prime number and contains no square in the sequence {a_n}.     - Let a_0 (=k geq 2) be a composite number. Then, a_0 can be factorized into:          a_0 = p_1^{alpha_1} p_2^{alpha_2} cdots p_m^{alpha_m}          where p_1, p_2, ldots, p_m are distinct prime numbers and alpha_i geq 1 for i = 1, 2, ldots, m. 5. We have:          a_1 = d(a_0) = (alpha_1 + 1)(alpha_2 + 1) cdots (alpha_m + 1)          - Since a_0 is not a perfect square, there exists at least one alpha_i which is odd.

Under this inversion, the line segment (AB) transforms into a circle (S') which passes through the points where circles (S_A) and (S_B) intersect other than (C). 2. **Effect on circles (S_A) and (S_B)**:          The circles (S_A) and (S_B) pass through (C) (where the inversion is centered). Thus, these circles transform into lines that pass through the center (O) of the circle (S'). This occurs because, under inversion, circles passing through the inversion center transform into lines, and vice versa. 3. **Circle (S) after inversion**:          Circle (S) is tangent to both (S_A) and (S_B), and also tangent to the segment (AB) at point (C_1). After the inversion, the image of circle (S), denoted as (S^*), becomes a circle that is tangent to the transformed lines (images of (S_A) and (S_B)) and also tangent to the circle (S') along the length (A^*B^*), the image of line segment (AB) under inversion. 4. **Analysis of tangency**:     Since (S^*) is tangent to the circle (S') precisely at the midpoint of the arc (A^*B^*), we see that this midpoint corresponds to point (C_1). This is crucial because it validates the preserved geometric relationships of tangency after inversion. 5. **Returning to original configuration**:          In the original configuration, the position of the point (C_1) relative to points (A) and (B) ensures that the line segment (CC_1) is the angle bisector of the triangle (ABC).

From these, k points are chosen to construct a convex kgon with vertices at the chosen points. What is the maximum possible value of k such that this polygon has no parallel sides?","output":"1. **Labeling the Points**:    We have 2012 points on the circumference of a circle, labeled as ( A_1, A_2, ldots, A_{2012} ). These points divide the circumference into equal arcs. 2. **Group the Points into Sets of Four**:    Consider the points in sets of four:    [    (A_1, A_2, A_{1007}, A_{1008}), (A_3, A_4, A_{1009}, A_{1010}), ldots, (A_{1005}, A_{1006}, A_{2011}, A_{2012})    ] 3. **Forming Quadrilaterals**:    If we select all four points from any one of these groups, we obtain a quadrilateral with vertices at ( A_{2i-1}, A_{2i}, A_{2i+1005}, A_{2i+1006} ). 4. **Identifying Parallel Sides**:    In such a quadrilateral, the sides ( A_{2i-1}A_{2i} ) and ( A_{2i+1005}A_{2i+1006} ) are on opposite sides of the circle and hence parallel due to rotational symmetry. 5. **Maximum Number of Vertices Without Parallel Sides**:    Each group of four points cannot have all four being selected without introducing parallel sides. Since we have 503 groups of four, we can select at most three points from each group without creating parallel sides. Thus:    [    k leq 503 cdot 3 = 1509    ] 6. **Constructing a 1509-Sided Polygon Without Parallel Sides**:    Consider the vertices of the 1509-sided polygon:    [    A_1, A_2, ldots, A_{1006}, A_{1008}, A_{1010}, ldots, A_{2012}.    ]    These are all the points from ( A_1 ) to ( A_{1006} ), and every second point from ( A_{1008} ) to ( A_{2012} ). 7. **Ensuring No Parallel Sides**:    - For the sides ( A_{2012}A_1, A_1A_2, ldots, A_{1005}A_{1006} ), they lie on one side of the circle relative to the diameter ( A_{2012}A_{1006} ).    - Similarly, sides ( A_{1006}A_{1008}, ldots, A_{2010}A_{2012} ) are chosen such that no two sides are parallel.    - Any pair of sides involving a small diagonal such as ( A_iA_{i+2} ) of the originally labeled points cannot be parallel to sides ( A_{i+1}A_{i+3} ) due to the irregular jump in numbering. # Conclusion: Thus, the greatest possible value of ( k ) is when the polygon does not have any parallel sides, which happens at ( k = 1509 ).

This result is due to the fact that reflecting over two intersecting lines is equivalent to rotating by twice the angle between those lines. Mathematically, if (R_l) and (R_m) represent reflections over lines l and m respectively, then the composition (R_m circ R_l) forms a rotation by (2alpha). 2. **Rotate around point O by angle 2alpha_{1}**:       The lines (l_1) and (m_1) are obtained by rotating (l) and (m) around point O. Therefore, the angle between (l_1) and (m_1) remains (alpha) because a rotation of the whole geometry around a point does not change the relative angles between the lines.

Since the gym is 7 miles away from his apartment, it is 7 - 5 = 2 miles more than half the distance from his apartment to work. Now, we have the distance from the gym to his apartment (G) as 7 miles, and the distance from his apartment to work as 10 miles.

The given condition is that for all x in mathbb{R}, f(f(x)) geq 0 must always be true. Let's analyze this condition for different cases of a: **Case 1: a = 0** If a=0, the function simplifies to f(x)=4x+1. The compound function becomes f(f(x))=16x+5. This is a linear function whose graph is a straight line with a positive slope. This line will cross the x-axis at a certain point, so there will be values of x for which f(f(x)) < 0. Therefore, the condition f(f(x)) geq 0 for all x in mathbb{R} is not satisfied when a=0. **Case 2: a > 0** For a>0, the function f(x) is an upwards-opening parabola, and the vertex of this parabola is at x = -frac{4}{2a} = -frac{2}{a}. The minimum value of f(x) occurs at the vertex and is given by fleft(-frac{2}{a}right) = aleft(-frac{2}{a}right)^2 + 4left(-frac{2}{a}right) + 1 = 1 - frac{4}{a}. Now, considering f(f(x)), we have: f(f(x)) geq fleft(1 - frac{4}{a}right) = aleft(1 - frac{4}{a}right)^2 + 4left(1 - frac{4}{a}right) + 1.  Expanding this expression, and then simplifying, we get: f(f(x)) geq a - 8 + frac{16}{a} + 4 - frac{16}{a} + 1 = a - 4 + 1 = a - 3.  To satisfy the condition that f(f(x)) geq 0, we require a - 3 geq 0, which gives us a geq 3. **Case 3: a < 0** For a<0, the function f(x) is a downwards-opening parabola. Regardless of the value of a, there will always be an x such that f(x) becomes arbitrarily large or small. Particularly, as x rightarrow -infty, the output of f(x) would also tend towards -infty. Consequently, there would exist some x for which f(f(x)) < 0, meaning the condition cannot be satisfied for a < 0. Combining the results from Cases 1, 2, and 3, we conclude that the range for a is a geq 3.

The LCM is the product of these highest powers: LCM = 2^5 * 3^3 = 32 * 27 = 864 Now, we know that the LCM of 24, 32, 36, and 54 is 864. The least number that is divisible by all these numbers is 864 or a multiple of 864.

The maximum value of f(x) on this interval is attained at x = 1: f(1) = (1 + 1)^{2} - 2ln (1 + 1) = 4 - 2ln 2 Thus, the minimum value of m is m_{min} = boxed{4 - 2ln 2}.

Whichever player takes the last square (in the bottom left corner) loses. If both players play perfectly, determine for which values of (m) and (n) the first player will win.","output":"The problem involves a two-player game on an m times n rectangular grid where players alternately make cuts and the goal is to force the other player to take the last square. The key to solving the problem is to understand the implications of making each cut and predicting the outcome of the game when both players play perfectly. 1. **Understanding the Moves**:     - On each turn, a player can either:       - Make a horizontal cut and take away the portion of the rectangle above the cut.       - Make a vertical cut and take away the portion to the right of the cut. 2. **Losing Condition**:     - The player who takes the last square (the square at the bottom left corner) loses. 3. **Analyzing the Winning Strategy**:     - Let's examine the board configurations starting from the simplest cases and move towards more complex ones.     - If the grid is a 1 times 1 square, the player forced to play on this grid loses immediately because they have to take the last square. 4. **Squares and Non-Squares**:     - If the grid is a square (i.e., m = n), the first player can only make cuts that result in non-square grids. After each turn, the grid is reduced to a smaller non-square grid. Eventually, through successive moves, the grid will reach the 1 times 1 grid, and thus, the second player will force the first player to lose.     - If the grid is not a square (i.e., m neq n), the first player can always make a cut to leave a square grid for the second player. For instance, if m > n, they can cut it down to form an n times n square, and if n > m, they can cut it down to form an m times m square. 5. **Detailed Strategy**:     - When the initial grid is a square (m = n), the first player is at a disadvantage right from the start:       - Any cut they make will leave the second player with a grid p times q where p neq q. Then, the second player can always turn it back into a square for the first player, ultimately forcing them into the losing 1 times 1 situation.     - When the initial grid is not a square (m neq n), the first player has a winning strategy:       - The first player will always cut to make the grid a square of the smaller dimension. For example, if m > n, they will perform a horizontal cut to leave an n times n square.        - This continually forces the second player into suboptimal positions until they are forced into the losing move. 6. **Conclusion**:     - The first player wins if the initial grid is not a square (m neq n).     - The second player wins if the initial grid is a square (m = n). Thus, the solution to the problem can be summarised as follows: boxed{text{The first player wins whenever } m neq n.}"},{"instruction":"Given ( a_{1}, a_{2}, cdots, a_{2n} ) are ( 2n ) distinct integers.

Since the product is equal to ((-1)^n (n!)^2), it follows that (|(r - a_{1})(r - a_{2}) cdots (r - a_{2n})| = (n!)^2). 2. The values (|r - a_{1}|, |r - a_{2}|, cdots, |r - a_{2n}|) must be (2n) positive integers such that their product is ((n!)^2). Notice that the product of (1 cdot 1 cdot 2 cdot 2 cdots n cdot n = (n!)^2). 3. These integers must be paired because, as shown, the product needs to be exactly ((n!)^2). If (|r - a_{i}| = |r - a_{j}| = |r - a_{k}|) for any (i, j, k) such that (i neq j neq k), this would create a contradiction since (a_i, a_j) and (a_k) are distinct integers.  4. Therefore, each value (|r - a_{i}|) must pair such that there are exactly two values paired for 1, two for 2, and so on, up to (n): [ |r - a_{1}|, |r - a_{2}|, cdots, |r - a_{2n}| = 1, 1, 2, 2, ldots, n, n. ] 5.

Summing up all differences ((r - a_{1}) + (r - a_{2}) + cdots + (r - a_{2n}) = 0), given that (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{2n}) are distinct, it simplifies to: [ r cdot 2n - (a_1 + a_2 + cdots + a_{2n}) = 0, ] yielding: [ r = frac{a_1 + a_2 + cdots + a_{2n}}{2n}. ] Thus, we have shown that the integer solution (r) can be expressed as the average: [ boxed{frac{a_{1} + a_{2} + cdots + a_{2n}}{2n}} ]"},{"instruction":"Let  n  and  m  be positive integers.

The divisibility rule for 11 is that the difference between the sum of the digits in the odd positions and the sum of the digits in the even positions must be a multiple of 11 (including 0). Let's apply this rule to the given number: (A + 5 + 9) - (1 + B + 4) = (A + 14) - (B + 5) = A - B + 9 For A15B94 to be divisible by 11, A - B + 9 must be a multiple of 11. Now we have two conditions: 1. A + B + 19 is a multiple of 9. 2. A - B + 9 is a multiple of 11. Let's find values of A and B that satisfy both conditions. Since A and B are digits, their values range from 0 to 9. For the first condition, the smallest multiple of 9 that is greater than 19 is 27, and then 36, 45, etc. But since A and B are single digits, the largest possible sum A + B can have is 18 (if both A and B are 9). Therefore, the smallest multiple of 9 that A + B + 19 could be is 27. This means A + B must be 27 - 19 = 8. For the second condition, A - B + 9 must be a multiple of 11. Since A + B is 8, let's find a pair of digits where their difference plus 9 is a multiple of 11. We can start with A = 4 and B = 4 (since 4 - 4 + 9 = 9, which is not a multiple of 11). We can increase A and decrease B to maintain their sum as 8 and find a pair that satisfies the condition. If A = 5 and B = 3, then A - B + 9 = 5 - 3 + 9 = 11, which is a multiple of 11. This pair satisfies both conditions. Therefore, A = 5 and B = 3. The sum of A and B is boxed{5}  + 3 = 8."},{"instruction":"Determine all functions ( f: mathbb{R} rightarrow mathbb{R} ) that satisfy the following equation for all ( x, y in mathbb{R} ): [ fleft((xy)^2right) = x^2  2y f(x) + (f(y))^2 ]","output":"To solve for the function (f: mathbb{R} rightarrow mathbb{R}) that satisfies the equation  [ fleft((x-y)^2right) = x^2 - 2y f(x) + (f(y))^2 ] for all (x, y in mathbb{R}), we proceed as follows:  Step 1: Setting (x = y = 0) We substitute (x=0) and (y=0): [ f((0-0)^2) = 0^2 - 2 cdot 0 cdot f(0) + (f(0))^2 implies f(0) = (f(0))^2 ] This simplifies to: [ f(0) = 0 quad text{or} quad f(0) = 1 ]  Step 2: Setting (y = 0) We substitute (y=0): [ fleft(x^2right) = x^2 - 2 cdot 0 cdot f(x) + (f(0))^2 implies fleft(x^2right) = x^2 + f(0)^2 ]  Step 3: Setting (x = 0) We substitute (x=0): [ fleft(y^2right) = 0^2 - 2y f(0) + (f(y))^2 implies fleft(y^2right) = -2y f(0) + (f(y))^2 ]  Step 4: Setting (x = y) We substitute (x = y): [ fleft((x-x)^2right) = x^2 - 2x f(x) + (f(x))^2 implies f(0) = (f(x) - x)^2 ] This leads to: [ f(0) = (f(x) - x)^2 ] From the possibilities of Step 1, we examine two cases for (f(0)): - **Case (f(0) = 0):** [ f(0) = (f(x) - x)^2 implies 0 = (f(x) - x)^2 implies f(x) = x ] - **Case (f(0) = 1):** [ f(1) = (f(x) - x)^2 implies 1 = (f(x) - x)^2 implies f(x) - x = pm 1 implies f(x) = x + 1 ] # Conclusion Both functions satisfy the given equation.

We can calculate the speed of the train when it crosses the bridge and when it crosses the lamp post. Since the speed of the train remains constant, we can use either situation to find the speed. Let's use the time it takes to cross the bridge to find the speed of the train. The train covers the length of the bridge (150 m) plus its own length in 7.5 seconds. Let the length of the train be L meters. When the train crosses the bridge, the total distance covered by the train is the length of the train plus the length of the bridge: Total distance = Length of the train (L) + Length of the bridge (150 m) The time taken to cross this total distance is 7.5 seconds. Speed = Distance / Time Speed of the train = (L + 150) / 7.5 Now, when the train crosses the lamp post, it only needs to cover its own length, as the lamp post can be considered as a point on the bridge. The time taken to cross the lamp post is 2.5 seconds. Using the same formula for speed: Speed of the train = Length of the train (L) / Time taken to cross the lamp post Speed of the train = L / 2.5 Since the speed of the train is the same in both situations, we can set the two expressions for speed equal to each other: (L + 150) / 7.5 = L / 2.5 Now, we can solve for L: (L + 150) * 2.5 = L * 7.5 2.5L + 375 = 7.5L 375 = 7.5L - 2.5L 375 = 5L L = 375 / 5 L = 75 Therefore, the length of the train is boxed{75}  meters."},{"instruction":"What is the measure, in degrees, of one interior angle of a regular octagon?","output":"To solve this problem, we apply the formula for the sum of the interior angles of an n-sided polygon: [ text{Sum of interior angles} = 180(n-2) ] For an octagon, n = 8.

The roots of the quadratic equation can be found using the quadratic formula:    [    x_{1,2} = frac{-b pm sqrt{b^2 - 4c}}{2}    ] 3. For the roots to be integers, the term under the square root (the discriminant) must be a perfect square. Let us denote the discriminant as ( Delta ):    [    Delta = b^2 - 4c    ]    Since ( Delta ) is given to be a perfect square, say ( Delta = k^2 ) for some integer ( k ). 4.

To prove that ( x_{1} ) and ( x_{2} ) are integers, we need to show that both numerators (-b - k) and (-b + k) are even.  6. Notice that ( k ) must be either even or odd depending on whether ( b ) is even or odd:    - If ( b ) is even, then ( k ) must also be even because ( b^2 ) and ( 4c ) are both even, making their difference ( b^2 - 4c ) (and thus ( k^2 )) even.    - If ( b ) is odd, then ( k ) must also be odd because ( b^2 ) and ( 4c ) are both odd, making their difference ( b^2 - 4c ) (and thus ( k^2 )) odd. 7. In both cases, the sum or difference of two even (or two odd) numbers is even. Consequently, both (-b - k) and (-b + k) are even. This implies that:    [    x_{1} = frac{-b - k}{2}, quad x_{2} = frac{-b + k}{2}    ]    are integers. # Conclusion: Therefore, if the discriminant of the quadratic equation (x^2 + bx + c =0), where ( b ) and ( c ) are integers, is a perfect square, then the roots of the quadratic equation are always integers.

We are interested in finding the maximum integer value that N can take such that at least 6 teams scored at least N points each by the end of the tournament. 3. Let's define two types of matches:     - Internal: Matches between the successful teams.     - External: Matches between a successful team and an unsuccessful team. 4. In every match, the two teams involved get a total of no more than 3 points combined. 5. First, calculate the number of internal matches.

Now, we demonstrate that it is possible for the 6 teams to score at least 34 points. Assign numbers to the teams from 1 to 15 and consider teams 1 through 6 as the successful teams. They can each score points as follows:     - Let each of the teams from 1 to 6 win against each of the teams from 7 to 15.

Let's denote the speed of Foma as ( v_F ) (in meters per hour) and the speed of Yeroma as ( v_Y ) (in meters per hour). 2.

Suppose in the beginning of the hour, Yeroma was (50) meters before the first of the six kilometer markers he will pass, and at the end of the hour, he was (50) meters past the sixth marker.     - The total distance traveled by Yeroma is:      [      v_Y = 6 times 1000 + 50 + 50 = 6000 + 100 = 6100 , text{meters}      ] 5.

Note that the number 1011 is not paired with any other number because its pair would sum to 2022 itself ( (1011 + 1011 = 2022) ). 3. We see that there are 1010 pairs listed above. To avoid violating the sum constraint, we can pick at most one number from each pair. Along with these, we will consider the number 1011 separately. 4. We then need to select 1011 numbers from 2021 possible numbers. Since there are 1010 pairs from which we need to select one number each, we need an additional number to reach 1011. This additional number must be 1011 itself, since none of the pairs include it. 5. Now, consider that we have chosen the number 1011. To ensure the sum condition is met, we cannot include the number (1010) because (1011 + 1010 = 2021), which would violate the sum condition. Consequently, we must include the number (1012) from the pair ((1010, 1012)) to ensure each pair has one number selected. 6. Proceeding this way:    - Since (1012) is included, (1009) must be excluded because (1009 + 1012 = 2021).    - From the pair ((1009, 1013)), we select (1013).    - Repeat this process: exclude (1008) because (1008 + 1013 = 2021), include (1014), and so on.     7. By following this pattern, we ensure that every pair contributes its higher number, and the lower of each of (1009 to 1) is excluded. 8. Finally, we confirm that including the numbers (1011, 1012, ldots, 2021) ensures we have 1011 numbers, and none of the sums of any two numbers violate the given condition (a + b neq 2021) or (2022). # Conclusion: There is only one way to select 1011 numbers such that their pairwise sums adhere to the given condition.

Find the coordinates of its center.","output":"The center of the hyperbola lies at the midpoint of the line segment connecting the two foci. The coordinates of the foci are (3, -2) and (11, 6). 1. Calculate the midpoint of these foci:    - The x-coordinate of the center is frac{3+11}{2} = frac{14}{2} = 7.    - The y-coordinate of the center is frac{-2+6}{2} = frac{4}{2} = 2.     2.

The point ( A ) is at the intersection of the ellipse with the positive ( x )-axis, which leads to the coordinates ( A(2, 0) ). We also know that the product of the slopes of lines ( AB ) and ( AC ) is (-frac{1}{4}) and ( G ) is the centroid of ( triangle ABC ). 1. **Identify Key Points and Determination of Centroid:**    The equation of the ellipse ( Gamma ) is ( frac{x^2}{4} + y^2 = 1 ). Therefore, ( A = (2, 0) ) and points ( B ) and ( C ) lie on this ellipse. Given the centroid ( G ) of ( triangle ABC ), with the properties of centroid, we have:    [    G = left( frac{x_1 + x_2 + x_3}{3}, frac{y_1 + y_2 + y_3}{3} right)    ]    Plugging point ( A ) which is ( (2, 0) ) and centroid properties, let:    [    B = (x_1, y_1) quad text{and} quad C = (x_2, y_2)    ]    The centroid ( G = left(frac{2 + x_1 + x_2}{3}, frac{0 + y_1 + y_2}{3}right) ). 2. **Calculate Specific Distance ( |GA| ):**    From the given, let's find ( |GA| ):    [    |GA| = sqrt{left(frac{2 + x_1 + x_2}{3} - 2right)^2 + left( frac{y_1 + y_2}{3} - 0 right)^2}    ]    Because ( G = (2/3, 0) ), we then calculate:    [    |GA| = sqrt{left( frac{2}{3} - 2 right)^2} = left| frac{2 - 6}{3}right| = left| -frac{4}{3} right| = frac{4}{3}    ]        Converting ( |GA| ) by previous finding:    [    |GA| =  frac{3}{4}    ] 3. **Finding Minimum and Maximum Values for ( |GB| + |GC| ):**    The calculation involves finding the range of:    [    |GB| + |GC| = sqrt{left( x - frac{2}{3} right)^2 + y^2} + sqrt{left( x + frac{2}{3} right)^2 + y^2}    ]    subject to the ellipse (Gamma: frac{x^2}{4} + y^2 = 1).
