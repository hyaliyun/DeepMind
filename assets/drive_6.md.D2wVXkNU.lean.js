Step 1: Understanding the context An Indian CA is a professional who has completed their chartered accountancy certification in India. Before I can determine if the answers to both questions are the same, I need to assess the demand and opportunities for Indian CAs in the Netherlands and Germany. Step 2: Research the scope of Indian CA in the Netherlands I would investigate the job market, the qualifications required for Indian CAs to work in the Netherlands, any additional certifications needed, and the overall demand for accountants in the country. By analyzing this information, I can determine the scope of an Indian CA in the Netherlands. Step 3: Research the scope of Indian CA in Germany Similarly, I would investigate the job market, qualifications, additional certifications, and demand for accountants in Germany to determine the scope of an Indian CA in the country. Step 4: Comparison Once I have collected the relevant information for both countries, I would compare the opportunities for Indian CAs in the Netherlands and Germany. If the scope and demand for Indian CAs are similar in both countries, the answers to questions 1 and 2 could be considered the same. Step 5: Answer the third question Based on the comparison made in Step 4, I can then choose between options (a) or (b). However, as the questions specifically asked about the scope of Indian CA in each respective country and not whether the scope is the same or not, it is difficult to answer with a simple 'yes' or 'no.'

If no no in fact see TI actually sends uh test samples from time to time uh, can we conclude that \\"TI never sends us anything.\\"?","output":"The statement \\"TI never sends us anything\\" refers to the assumption that there is a complete absence of communication, material, or resources being exchanged between the two entities: TI and the receiver (in this case, \\"us\\"). From the information provided, it is understood that TI does send test samples occasionally. The assertion would be inaccurate if the intent is to convey that there is no interaction between the two entities. To understand the situation further, let's break down the scenario into key components: 1. Interaction between TI and the receiver (us): The context of this interaction is the exchange of test samples, which is an essential part of communication between businesses, organizations, or individuals. 2. Frequency of test samples sent by TI: It has been stated that TI sends test samples \\"from time to time.\\" This refers to an irregular or infrequent occurrence, yet it still shows that there is some interaction between the two entities. 3. The need for clarification: The statement, \\"TI never sends us anything,” projects an absolute conclusion and, if taken literally, it implies zero interaction. However, as there is evidence that TI sends test samples occasionally, this statement does not accurately represent the situation. A more accurate statement would be, \\"TI rarely sends us anything,\\" or \\"TI infrequently sends us test samples.\\" Moreover, the vagueness surrounding the frequency of these test samples can be further understood by looking into the factors that might influence their deployment. Here are a few possibilities: a. Business policies: TI might have a policy regarding the irregular sharing of test samples, depending on the changes to the products or services they offer or based on market demands. b. Schedule or events: TI might send test samples during specific internal or external events when they believe it is essential or beneficial to engage with their audience, customers, or partners. c. Resource constraints: TI may have limitations on their resources, leading to inconsistent availability to send out test samples. These constraints could be financial, logistical, or dependent on workforce availability. d. Changing priorities: TI might reallocate their resources or modify their business strategies, which could impact the regularity of the test samples being shared. In conclusion, it would be inappropriate to say that \\"TI never sends us anything\\" since there is evidence that TI does send test samples periodically. Instead, it would be more accurate to describe the situation as TI sending test samples infrequently or rarely. To gain a deeper understanding of the nature of this interaction, one should analyze the factors listed above and any other possible variables that could contribute to the irregularity of these exchanges."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What are the side effects of eating momos?","output":"While both of these questions ask about the side effects of eating certain types of food, they are inquiring about different items, and therefore do not have the same meaning. Let's explore each question in more detail. 1. What are the side effects of eating chocolate? Chocolate, which is made from cocoa beans, is a popular treat enjoyed by many around the world. It comes in various forms such as dark chocolate, milk chocolate, and white chocolate. The side effects of consuming chocolate can be both positive and negative. Positive side effects: - Mood enhancement: Chocolate contains compounds such as phenylethylamine, theobromine, and caffeine, which can stimulate the brain and improve mood. - Antioxidant properties: Dark chocolate, in particular, is rich in flavonoids, which have antioxidant properties that can help protect the body from cell damage caused by free radicals. - Improved heart health: Some research suggests that consuming moderate amounts of dark chocolate may be beneficial for heart health. It may lower blood pressure, improve blood flow, and reduce the risk of blood clots and stroke. Negative side effects: - Weight gain: Chocolate is high in calories and fat, which can contribute to weight gain if consumed in excessive amounts. - Tooth decay: The sugar content in chocolate can lead to tooth decay and cavities if proper dental hygiene is not maintained. - Migraine headaches: Some individuals may experience migraines due to the presence of certain compounds in chocolate. - Allergic reactions: Individuals with a cocoa or chocolate allergy may experience symptoms such as itching, hives, or difficulty breathing upon consumption of chocolate products. 2. What are the side effects of eating momos? Momos are a type of dumpling that originates from the Nepalese/Tibetan region and is popular in many parts of Asia. Typically filled with meat or vegetables, they can be steamed, fried, or boiled. The side effects of consuming momos can be positive or negative, depending on the individual's dietary needs, preferences, and potential allergies. Positive side effects: - Nutrient content: Momos filled with nutrient-rich vegetables and lean meats can contribute to a balanced diet and provide essential vitamins, minerals, and proteins. - Healthy cooking methods: Steamed momos do not contain added oil or fat, making them a healthier alternative to fried food. - Taste and cultural experience: Momos offer a flavorful and unique culinary experience, introducing people to new flavors and textures. Negative side effects: - Consumption of unhealthy fillings: Some momo fillings may be high in fat and sodium, which can be detrimental to health when consumed frequently or in large quantities. - Food hygiene concerns: If momos are prepared in an unhygienic environment or with low-quality ingredients, it can lead to foodborne illnesses or side effects such as upset stomach, vomiting, or diarrhea. - Allergic reactions: Some ingredients used in momos, like wheat-based wrappers or specific fillings, may cause allergic reactions among individuals with food allergies. In conclusion, while both questions inquire about the side effects of consuming different foods, they are asking about two distinct items with their unique health benefits and potential drawbacks."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

There is evident dissatisfaction with the food quality. The author details their disappointment by describing the quantity of the food wouldn't compensate for the poor quality, exemplified through the phrase \\"huge servings of terrible food didn't make up for the fact that it was still terrible food.\\" The repeated references to the food being \\"terrible\\" emphasize the strong negative sentiment held by the reviewer.

It really explains what a prophet is in our modern day society and like the OT prophets. You will not be accepted nor understood by the people in their comfortable Religious Box.

Yiddishkeit is specifically the Jewishness of Ashkenazi Jews. Before the Haskalah and the emancipation of Jews in Europe, this meant the study of Torah and Talmud for men, and a family and communal life governed by the observance of Jewish Law for men and women. From the Rhineland to Riga to Romania, most Jews prayed in liturgical Ashkenazi Hebrew, and spoke Yiddish in their secular lives. But with modernization, Yiddishkeit now encompasses not just Orthodoxy and Hasidism, but a broad range of movements, ideologies, practices, and traditions in which Ashkenazi Jews have participated and somehow retained a sense of Jewishness. Although a far smaller number of Jews still speak Yiddish, Yiddishkeit can be identified in manners of speech, in styles of humor, in patterns of association. Broadly speaking, a Jew is one who associates culturally with Jews, supports Jewish institutions, reads Jewish books and periodicals, attends Jewish movies and theater, travels to Israel, visits historical synagogues, and so forth.

Please answer the following question: Question: \\"what time period is mentioned first?\\"  Context: \\"In 1931, RCA Victor introduced their vinyl-based Victrolac compound as a material for some unusual-format and special-purpose records. By the end of the 1930s vinyl's advantages of light weight, relative unbreakability and low surface noise had made it the material of choice for prerecorded radio programming and other critical applications. When it came to ordinary 78 rpm records, however, the much higher cost of the raw material, as well as its vulnerability to the heavy pickups and crudely mass-produced steel needles still commonly used in home record players, made its general substitution for shellac impractical at that time. During the Second World War, the United States Armed Forces produced thousands of 12-inch vinyl 78 rpm V-Discs for use by the troops overseas. After the war, the wider use of vinyl became more practical as new record players with relatively lightweight crystal pickups and precision-ground styli made of sapphire or an exotic osmium alloy proliferated. In late 1945, RCA Victor began offering special transparent red vinyl De Luxe pressings of some classical 78s, at a de luxe price. Later, Decca Records introduced vinyl Deccalite 78s, while other record companies came up with vinyl concoctions such as Metrolite, Merco Plastic and Sav-o-flex, but these were mainly used to produce \\"unbreakable\\" children's records and special thin vinyl DJ pressings for shipment to radio stations.\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"The time period mentioned first in the given context is 1931.

They were sharing an apple, one of those tart green ones, and as Dara took her turn gnashing into it, Jody gagged and vomited up some peel. 'Shit, are you okay?' Dara asked, rubbing Jody's back. 'Um, yeah,' Jody croaked, and started to laugh. 'Just dying of apple peel.' Dara began to laugh too. Looking at the little pile of fruit skin and foam brought on more laughter, and they were both suddenly breathless but unable to cease the spasms of laughter hiccupping up from their stomachs. They had to lean on each other to save falling over, and even the tut-tut tongue-clicking of the old Italian lady having to divert around them on the footpath could barely stop the infinite but elusive humour. The bus droning into the stop enabled them some composure, but once on board just looking at each other was enough to start it up again. This was the coolest day Dara had had in forever. Jody and her had decided to wag school just that morning before rollcall, and despite her anxiety -- this was actually the first time Dara had ever wagged -- she was so, so glad she did. They were both in Year 11, and had only become friends three months earlier. They were from totally different scenes at school, but one maths lesson had changed all that.

Answer:","output":"The song \\"Oh, I'm Going to Barbados\\" is alternatively known as \\"Barbados,\\" and it was originally performed by the British band Typically Tropical. The group, comprising of musicians Jeff Calvert and Max West, released the song as their debut single in the summer of 1975. \\"Barbados\\" was a commercial success for Typically Tropical, quickly rising through the charts and peaking at the number one spot on the UK Singles Chart. The song's catchy melody and tropical-inspired lyrics full of sun, sea, and sand evoked a sense of escapism, making it a popular hit during that period. The track narrates the story of a bus driver's dream of leaving his mundane routine behind, imagining his life in the beautiful island paradise of Barbados. The song features a mix of reggae, pop, and calypso influences, embodying the island's laid-back and sunny atmosphere. While Typically Tropical's original rendition of \\"Barbados\\" remains the most commonly associated version with the song, other artists have also covered it over the years. In 1983, the Vengaboys, a Dutch Eurodance group, released their own cover version titled \\"We're Going to Ibiza,\\" which adapted the lyrics and the setting but retained the original catchy melody. This adaptation became a popular hit in its own right, topping the charts in several countries, including the UK. In conclusion, the song \\"Oh, I'm Going to Barbados\\" was originally performed by Typically Tropical, a British band consisting of Jeff Calvert and Max West.

He is of German descent, his great-grandfather Joseph Clemens having immigrated in the 1880s. Clemens's parents separated when he was an infant. His mother soon married Woody Booher, whom Clemens considers his father. In the 1986 American League Championship Series, Clemens pitched poorly in the opening game, watched the Boston bullpen blow his 3-0 lead in the bottom of the ninth inning of Game 4, and then pitched a strong Game 7 to wrap up the series for Boston. The 1986 ALCS clincher was Clemens' first postseason career victory. He did not win his second until 13 years later.  After a bad start in Game 2 of the 1986 World Series, Clemens returned to the mound for Game 6, which would have clinched the World Series for the Boston Red Sox. Clemens left the game after 7 innings leading 3-2, but the Red Sox went on to lose the game in the 10th inning, and subsequently, the championship. Clemens' departure was highly debated and remains a bone of contention among the participants. Red Sox manager John McNamara claimed Clemens took himself out due to a blister, though Clemens strongly denies that.  Clemens greatest postseason failure came in the second inning of the final game of the 1990 ALCS against the Oakland Athletics, when he was ejected for arguing balls and strikes with umpire Terry Cooney, accentuating the A's three-game sweep of the Red Sox. He was suspended for the first five games of the 1991 season and fined 10,000. Clemens had two other playoff no-decisions, in 1988 and 1995, both occurring while Boston was being swept. Clemens' overall postseason record with Boston was 1-2 with a 3.88 ERA, and 45 strikeouts and 19 walks in 56 innings. How did he perform in game 6?","output":"In Game 6 of the 1986 World Series, Roger Clemens put forth a solid performance. He pitched for 7 innings and left the game with the Boston Red Sox leading 3-2. During his time on the mound, he helped keep the New York Mets' offense at bay, giving his team the chance to secure the championship. However, his performance was overshadowed by the Red Sox's eventual loss in the 10th inning, which further extended the World Series to a seventh game. Clemens' departure from the game was a point of contention between him and Red Sox manager John McNamara. McNamara claimed that Clemens removed himself from the game due to a blister, while Clemens strongly denied this assertion. Despite the controversy surrounding his exit, Clemens' performance in Game 6 showcased his pitching prowess and ability to perform under high-pressure situations. Unfortunately, his effort in Game 6 did not lead the Red Sox to clinch the championship, as they went on to lose the game and eventually the World Series to the Mets. However, Clemens' overall statistics and impact in the 1986 postseason contributed greatly to the Red Sox's ability to fight for the championship and ensured his status as one of the era's dominant pitchers."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The explosion was at a nuclear power plant in another country called Ukraine. The radiation  caused a lot of damage. It polluted the soil and other things. People lived in the area when the explosion happened. Twenty years later those people are still suffering. Effects from the explosion will go on for a long time. Over two million people still live in the polluted areas. Only 56 people died from the explosion but many other problems have been caused because of it. Some types of cancer are more than 200 times above world average. Many children have cancer now and birth defects  have doubled since the accident. Some people in the United States are worried about the children living there. One group has been trying to raise money. They are called the Chernobyl Children's Project. They want to bring children from the Ukraine to the U.S. each summer. A spokesperson for the group says that radiation is the highest in the summertime, so it is a good time to get the children out of the country. They want to help the children get away for a little while. The Project wants them to be safe from radiation. It costs 1,500 to bring each child to the United States for six weeks. The group raised enough money to bring 28 children to the United States. The children were able to do lots of fun things. They enjoyed clean air, healthy food, and plenty of outdoor fun. One little nine-year-old girl who got to come to the United States said that she likes America. A spokesperson for the Project said that the children that come to America during the summer miss less school when they return home.

He realized that to understand climate change issues he first needed to distinguish between the terms weather and climate. To that end, he labeled weather as term A. Then he labeled climate as term B. He found it easier to understand their differences in that way.  Which changes less frequently, term A or term B?  Hint: Weather is a set of all the phenomena occurring in a given atmospheric area at a given time. Most weather phenomena occur in the troposphere, just below the stratosphere. Weather refers, generally, to day-to-day temperature and precipitation activity, whereas climate is the term for the average atmospheric conditions over longer periods of time. When used without qualification, \\"weather\\" is understood to be the weather of Earth. Answer:","output":"In David's labeling system, term A represents weather, and term B represents climate. To understand which changes less frequently, let's examine the definitions of both terms and their differences. Term A (Weather): Weather refers to the short-term atmospheric conditions in a specific location. It includes a combination of elements like temperature, humidity, precipitation, cloud cover, wind speed, and air pressure. Weather can change rapidly, with alterations happening within minutes, hours, or days. Weather phenomena primarily occur in the troposphere, which is just below the stratosphere. Term B (Climate): Climate, on the other hand, is the long-term average of weather conditions in a particular region or across the planet. Climate considers the patterns and trends of temperature, precipitation, humidity, and other weather elements over extended periods, usually measured in decades or even centuries. Therefore, climate represents a more stable, underlying pattern, which doesn't change as quickly as day-to-day weather conditions. Based on these definitions and explanations, it becomes evident that term B (Climate) changes less frequently than term A (Weather). The weather experiences rapid fluctuations, while climate represents a more consistent pattern over a longer timescale. Understanding this distinction is crucial in comprehending climate change issues and the impacts of human activities on Earth's atmosphere, ecosystems, and overall climate system."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

You can find over-the-counter acne preparations with lower doses of retinoids than you'll get from a prescription.  However, many people respond to the over-the-counter strength products well and do not need prescriptions. Ask your doctor if you need a prescription or if over the counter is a better option for you. Women with bad acne have the option to use oral contraceptives to control their hormonal levels. This also has the advantage helping to balance other secondary effects of the hormones, such as irritability and water weight gain.  You need a prescription to get contraceptives that affect your hormones. Don't use oral contraceptives if you are pregnant or trying to get pregnant. Accutane is an anti-acne medication for treatment of severe acne and requires a prescription. If you have sebaceous gland hypertrophy or severe acne, ask your doctor if Accutane is right for you.  You will need to have your blood monitored every month while taking the medication and may experience side effects for several months after using it. Do not use Accutane unless you fully understand the risks of the medication. Accutane can have long-term effects on your health and wellness. You cannot take Accutane if you are pregnant or planning to become pregnant. Phototherapy is a treatment option you can perform at home by purchasing special equipment, or you can choose to ask your dermatologist.  Research supports this treatment, which is simple and easy to perform. Technically, exposure to sunlight is phototherapy. However, in climates where the sun doesn't shine enough hours or you can't get outside when the sun is out, you can purchase a phototherapy unit. Use the unit to treat your acne as directed and using the safety precautions listed on the unit. Possible side effects from using these units include skin that becomes red, peels or changes skin tone.  Your doctor may also perform photodynamic therapy in the office. This involves applying a medication to the skin, which is then activated by a special light. This is more effective than a light treatment alone. Oral and topical antibiotics may be used to treat acne, especially when reinfection is a concern. Topical antibiotics can be used long-term, usually along with benzoyl peroxide or retinoids. Oral antibiotics are usually used short-term to get a bad breakout under control. Antibiotics are especially useful for inflammatory acne, which is acne with a lot of red bumps, pimples, or cysts.","output":"This article discusses various treatment options for managing and combating acne, focusing on the use of retinoids, oral contraceptives, Accutane, phototherapy, and antibiotics.  Retinoids, a form of vitamin A, help reduce sebaceous gland hypertrophy and can be found in over-the-counter acne products. These non-prescription strength products often work well for many individuals, but a doctor's advice is recommended to decide if a prescription is necessary.  For women with severe acne, oral contraceptives can be used to regulate hormonal levels. This not only addresses acne, but also helps balance other hormone-related issues, such as irritability and water weight gain. However, contraceptives must not be used by those who are pregnant or trying to conceive and require a prescription from a healthcare professional. Accutane is an anti-acne medication designed for severe acne treatment, which requires a prescription and close monitoring. Blood tests must be conducted monthly while on the medication, and side effects may persist for months after its use. Due to its potential long-term health effects, it is crucial to understand the risks associated with Accutane before using it. Accutane must not be taken by those who are pregnant or planning to conceive. Phototherapy, which can be conducted at home or by a dermatologist, is a treatment supported by research. Sunlight exposure itself is a form of phototherapy, but special equipment can be purchased for use in less sunny climates or indoor settings. Despite its simplicity, some side effects may arise, such as redness, peeling, or changes in skin tone. Photodynamic therapy administered by a doctor is more effective and involves applying medication to the skin activated by a specific light. Lastly, oral and topical antibiotics can be employed to treat acne, particularly in cases of inflammatory acne or risk of reinfection. Topical antibiotics can be used long-term alongside benzoyl peroxide or retinoids, whereas oral antibiotics are typically employed short-term for controlling acute breakouts."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

From which animal is the milk taken?","output":"The \\"Caravane\\" cheese is produced in Mauritania, a country located in West Africa. This unique cheese is derived from the milk of a domesticated camel, specifically the dromedary camel (Camelus dromedarius), which is native to the region. Camel milk has been an essential part of the diet of various nomadic and pastoral communities inhabiting the arid and semi-arid regions of Africa and Asia for thousands of years. The camel is exceptionally well-suited to the harsh climate conditions of these areas, as it can bear high temperatures, long periods of water scarcity, and travel vast distances with relatively low energy expenditure. Camel milk is more nutritious than cow milk and has a higher content of vitamins and minerals, such as vitamin C, iron, calcium, and potassium. It also contains less cholesterol and saturated fat, making it a healthier alternative. Additionally, camel milk is known for its therapeutic properties, such as its antiviral, antibacterial, and anti-inflammatory effects. The process of making traditional \\"Caravane\\" cheese is quite fascinating. First, the camel milk is left to ferment naturally for a day or two in a container made from either wood, leather, or plastic. Once the milk thickens and curdles, the curds are drained and the whey is separated. The curd is then molded into a distinctive round shape, usually wrapped in a palm leaf or another type of natural, biodegradable material that can be easily sourced from the region. Once the cheese is formed, it is left to ripen for a few days to up to two weeks, depending on the preferred level of firmness and flavor intensity. During the ripening process, the cheese develops its characteristic robust and slightly salty taste, with a creamy consistency that melts nicely in the mouth. \\"Caravane\\" camel cheese is consumed by the local population and is also gaining popularity in other parts of the world due to its nutritional content and unique flavor. This cheese can be enjoyed on its own, with traditional bread or served with fruits, nuts, or as a garnish for various savory dishes. In conclusion, \\"Caravane\\" is the brand name of a cheese produced in Mauritania, and it is made from the milk of dromedary camels. The camel milk provides a higher nutritional value compared to cow milk, which makes it an attractive choice for cheese production. Moreover, the traditional process of making Caravane cheese highlights the region's unique cultural practices, making it an interesting gastronomic experience."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

However, the premise does not explicitly provide information about the exacerbation of the situation due to flooding. Thus, we need to examine whether this premise entails the hypothesis \\"I heard that the flooding was bad\\" or not. Entailment in this context refers to the logical relationship between the premise (information provided) and the hypothesis (supposition or assumption based on the premise). If the premise is true, then the hypothesis is also likely true. However, if the premise is not connected or not sufficient to support the hypothesis, then the entailment cannot be established. In our case, the premise is focused on the occurrence of rain and its negative impact on the area. Nonetheless, the emphasis is on rain rather than flooding. Flooding refers to a situation where an area gets inundated with water due to factors like an overflow of a water body, excessive rainfall, or poor water management. As a result, establishing an entailment between the premise and the hypothesis is difficult without more specific information about the actual damage caused by the rain. For example, it is possible that the rain has caused disruption to daily life, traffic jams, or infrastructure damage, but it may not necessarily involve flooding. The term \\"it's really been that bad\\" in the premise is vague and does not clarify the extent of the damage, nor does it mention the scale of the problem in terms of flooding. It could mean that the rain was severe and caused issues on its own without necessarily causing floods. Therefore, based on the premise, the entailment between the given information and the hypothesis, \\"I heard that the flooding was bad,\\" is inconclusive and cannot be established with certainty. It would require additional data or evidence, such as eyewitness accounts, reports on flood levels, infrastructure damage due to floods, or local warnings specifically concerning flood risks, to determine if the hypothesis is indeed accurate and corresponds with the premise."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Subsequent reigns were increasingly marked by eunuch intervention in court politics and their involvement in the violent power struggles of the imperial consort clans. With the aid of the eunuch Zheng Zhong (d. 107 AD), Emperor He (r. 88–105 AD) had Empress Dowager Dou (d. 97 AD) put under house arrest and her clan stripped of power. This was in revenge for Dou's purging of the clan of his natural mother—Consort Liang—and then concealing her identity from him.

Jailed: Philip Gaisford, 64, a former Scotland Yard chief superintendent, was found guilty of 27 offences against nine boys and girls. A retired top police officer who set up a scuba diving business so he could groom young boys for sex has been jailed for life. Philip Gaisford, 64, used his six-figure retirement pay off to build a swimming pool at his £1.5m home. The former Scotland Yard chief superintendent enticed dozens of children with scuba lessons and pool parties. But he abused his trusted position to single out potential victims who he plied with sparkling wine as he enforced a ‘no trunks’ policy. The case raises worrying questions about how he was able to prey on young people for so long without being stopped. The pervert was arrested in 2000 when a boy claimed he was sexually abused after Gaisford organised work experience for him at the Met. But the investigation was dropped, leaving Gaisford free to continue running his seedy scuba diving business for another decade. During that time hundreds of young people visited his home in Crowborough, East Sussex, for group lessons and private tuition. Lewes Crown Court heard how Gaisford was finally brought to justice after an acrimonious divorce from his wife Susan, 62. The couple moved to East Sussex after she twice caught him naked with young men at their previous home in Caterham, Surrey. She gave him a second chance but tipped off police about child abuse images on his computer when he admitted having sex with a 15-year-old boy. Officers arrested him and discovered a stash of handcuffs and flick knives which Gaisford had confiscated during his 30-year career with the Met. Suspicious detectives began contacting potential victims as they examined paperwork from the scuba business. Among them was the victim from the 2000 case. They discovered Gaisford was at the centre of a horrific web of abuse which took place around pools at both properties. Locked up: The former police officer retired from the Met in 1999 amid questions over his attendance record. He used the scuba diving business as a front to create opportunities when he could be alone with the most vulnerable young people and abuse them. Gaisford also attracted dozens of scouts by renting out a large field beside his sprawling rural property. Prosecutor Mark Gadsden said Gaisford encouraged his pupils – many of whom saw him as a ‘father figure’ – to remove their swimming trunks. He said Gaisford held ‘pool parties’ at which he molested boys and girls who ‘did not want to be touched in that way’ and nick-named him 'paedo-Phil'. He added: ‘He was able to manipulate these young people and persuade them and himself that there was nothing wrong with it.’ The court heard Gaisford organised scuba diving trips to Egypt during which he was ‘very touchy feely’ and set up reunion parties when they returned. Jurors were shown pictures of him in a pair of speedos drinking and encouraging young people to wax his chest hair off. Sex attacker: Gaisford encouraged his pupils 'many of whom saw him as a 'father figure' to remove their swimming trunks. In one image the words ‘insert here’ were written on Gaisford's back with an arrow pointing downwards, alongside a lewd drawing. In emotional evidence, one victim told the court he was raped and abused for three years after falling under Gaisford’s spell as a scout. The man said he was made to wear ‘tight swimming trunks’ which he was ordered to remove for a sauna after scuba lessons. He said the sexual abuse started with Gaisford ‘massaging’ him naked. It then progressed from naked swimming to kissing and sex. At one point Gaisford claimed to give him a ‘medical examination’ by inserting a finger into his body, which he said he was doing to check his prostate. The man, who was 16 at the time of the abuse, said: ‘I was scared of him telling my parents about all of it. Sex attacker: Philip Gaisford, 64, used his six-figure retirement pay off to build a swimming pool at his £1.5m home. ‘I didn't know what he was capable of, although he was nice to me I have seen him be not so nice to other people.’ The victim finally went to police when he tried to cut off Gaisford and the former police officer threatened to tell his family about what had happened. Jailed: Gaisford was first arrested in 2000 when a boy claimed he was sexually abused, but the investigation was dropped. Gaisford, who retired from the Met in 1999 amid questions over his attendance record, served in Soho and Mayfair. He then went on to work for another Government agency before being sacked in 2003 on his conviction for assaulting police officers after being caught drink driving. The pervert admitted to police that he had the ‘Gaisford curse’, meaning he had a high sex drive, which he found hard to ‘keep in check’. He blamed child abuse images on his computer, many of which had a ‘spanking’ theme, on being sent boarding school as a child. Gaisford, who has been in custody since August, was convicted of 27 sexual offences against nine victims – including four boys and two girls – between 1997 and 2008. His youngest victim was a 13-year-old boy. He was also convicted of raping an adult woman and 10 offences of possessing indecent videos of children. He was sentenced to life imprisonment and ordered to serve a minimum of 12 years before he can apply for parole when he was jailed last Friday. Det Insp Rob Morland, of Sussex Police, said the former police officer was only brought to justice thanks to the courage of his victims. He said: ‘Gaisford systematically and cynically abused trusting young people who had become involved with him in his capacity as a scuba diving instructor and the court clearly found his conduct to be a gross breach of trust.’ Write highlights for this article.","output":"This article tells the story of Philip Gaisford, a former top police officer, who got into trouble for doing very bad things to young boys and girls. He used his money from retiring to build a swimming pool at his home and start a scuba diving business. He would invite children to his home for scuba lessons and pool parties, but he took advantage of their trust and hurt them in bad ways.  After many years, Philip was finally caught because his wife told the police about the bad things he had done. The police found out that he had hurt many children and had many bad pictures and videos on his computer. He was taken to court and found guilty of 27 bad things that he did to nine children, as well as hurting an adult woman. He was sent to jail for life, which means he will spend the rest of his life in prison. The police officer in charge of the case thanked the brave victims for speaking up and helping to bring Philip to justice."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Math problem: Solve -2*j + 19 = 29 for j. What is the solution?","output":"Alright, kiddo! Let's solve this fun math problem together. We need to find the value of j in this equation: -2*j + 19 = 29. First, let's try to move the 19 over to the other side of the equal sign, so we only have j-related things on one side. To do that, we have to subtract 19 from both sides of the equation:  -2*j + 19 - 19 = 29 - 19 Now, 19 - 19 is 0, and 29 - 19 is 10, so our equation becomes: -2*j = 10 Now, we want to find out what j is. To do that, we should divide both sides of the equation by -2: (-2*j) / -2 = 10 / -2 Since -2 divided by -2 is 1 (a negative divided by a negative is a positive), we get:  1*j = -5 And that's the same as: j = -5 There you go!

Given the question: Background: Depleted soils can be protected from soil erosion by groundcover plants such as naturally growing grasses in agroforestry systems. These help to stabilise the soil as they increase cover compared to short-cycle cropping systems. Soil cover is a crucial factor in preventing erosion. Cleaner water through reduced nutrient and soil surface runoff can be a further advantage of agroforestry. The runoff can be reduced by decreasing its velocity and increasing infiltration into the soil. Compared to row-cropped fields nutrient uptake can be higher and reduce nutrient loss into streams.Further advantages concerning plant growth:  Paragraph: Gary and Joe are two farmers. Joe's  farm has a depleted soil, while Gary started agroforestry a few years back, and grows cover crops.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which farmer didn't reduce nutrient runoff from his farm? The answer is:","output":"Joe. Step-by-step justification: 1. The paragraph mentions that Joe's farm has depleted soil, while Gary's farm has agroforestry with cover crops. 2.

No. Do you think the right answer to the question \\"what does a gasoline lawn mower convert gasoline into?\\" is \\"minerals\\", given that  a gasoline lawn mower converts gasoline into movement? Answer:","output":"The options \\"Yes\\" and \\"No\\" provided do not give an appropriate response to the question at hand. Therefore, I would like to provide the relevant information as a detailed answer. A gasoline lawn mower operates on an internal combustion engine, which utilizes gasoline as its primary source of fuel. When the question asks whether a gasoline lawn mower converts gasoline into \\"minerals,\\" it is essential to understand the underlying processes and reactions that occur during the conversion of gasoline into movement. During the operation of the lawn mower, gasoline undergoes combustion within the engine. Combustion is a chemical reaction where a hydrocarbon (gasoline) reacts with oxygen to produce heat, light, and chemical byproducts. The significant byproducts of gasoline combustion are carbon dioxide (CO2), water vapor (H2O), and trace amounts of other gases such as carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and unburned hydrocarbons (HC). The heat and gas pressure generated during combustion push the engine's pistons, which, in turn, rotates a crankshaft that powers the lawn mower's wheels and blades, creating movement. When referring to \\"minerals,\\" it is crucial to recognize that these are naturally occurring inorganic substances with a specific crystalline structure, which may include substances such as metals, non-metals, or silicates. The process of converting gasoline into movement through combustion does not involve the creation or transformation of gasoline into minerals. Instead, combustion breaks down the chemical structure of gasoline (a hydrocarbon), facilitating its reaction with oxygen to release energy in the form of heat and gas pressure, which is then harnessed to enable movement. Consequently, the byproducts generated during this process are primarily gaseous substances like carbon dioxide, water vapor, and other trace gases, not minerals. In summary, the answer to the question \\"Does a gasoline lawn mower convert gasoline into minerals?\\" is no. A gasoline lawn mower does not convert gasoline into minerals; rather, it converts gasoline into thermal energy, gas pressure, and gaseous byproducts through combustion, which is then utilized by the engine to create movement."},{"instruction":"Teacher:In this task, your goal is to judge a correct answer to a given question based on an associated paragraph and decide if it is a good correct answer or not.

Conclusion: Based on the aforementioned analysis, the most sound solution in terms of naive physics reasoning is: \\"You will get a bigger number from adding 2 numbers together.\\" This is true for many common situations, such as adding two positive numbers or combining a negative number with a larger positive number. However, it is important to note that different combinations of numbers may yield different results, as indicated in our analysis of positive and negative numbers."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Question: Information:  - JPEG XR (abbr. for JPEG extended range) is a still-image compression standard and file format for continuous tone photographic images, based on technology originally developed and patented by Microsoft under the name HD Photo (formerly Windows Media Photo). It supports both lossy and lossless compression, and is the preferred image format for Ecma-388 Open XML Paper Specification documents.  - JPEG 2000 (JP2) is an image compression standard and coding system. It was created by the Joint Photographic Experts Group committee in 2000 with the intention of superseding their original discrete cosine transform-based JPEG standard (created in 1992) with a newly designed, wavelet-based method. The standardized filename extension is .jp2 for ISO/IEC 15444-1 conforming files and .jpx for the extended part-2 specifications, published as ISO/IEC 15444-2. The registered MIME types are defined in RFC 3745. For ISO/IEC 15444-1 it is image/jp2.  - Digital photography is a form of photography that uses cameras containing arrays of electronic photodetectors to capture images focused by a lens, as opposed to an exposure on photographic film. The captured images are digitized and stored as a computer file ready for further digital processing, viewing, digital publishing or printing.  - The ITU Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T) is one of the three sectors (divisions or units) of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU); it coordinates standards for telecommunications.  - The Joint Photographic Experts Group is the joint committee between ISO/IEC JTC1 and ITU-T (formerly CCITT) that created the JPEG, JPEG 2000, and JPEG XR standards. It is one of two sub-groups of ISO/IEC Joint Technical Committee 1, Subcommittee 29, Working Group 1 (ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 29/WG 1)  titled as \\"Coding of still pictures\\". In the ITU-T, its work falls in the domain of the ITU-T Visual Coding Experts Group (VCEG). ISO/IEC JTC1 SC29 Working Group 1 (working together with ITU-T Study Group 16  SG16 and previously also with Study Group 8  SG8) is responsible for the JPEG and JBIG standards. The scope of the organization includes the work of both the Joint Photographic Experts Group and Joint Bi-level Image Experts Group.  - JPEG is a commonly used method of lossy compression for digital images, particularly for those images produced by digital photography. The degree of compression can be adjusted, allowing a selectable tradeoff between storage size and image quality. JPEG typically achieves 10:1 compression with little perceptible loss in image quality.  - In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm is a self-contained sequence of actions to be performed. Algorithms perform calculation, data processing, and/or automated reasoning tasks.  - A digital image is a numeric representation of (normally binary) a two-dimensional image. Depending on whether the image resolution is fixed, it may be of vector or raster type. By itself, the term \\"digital image\\" usually refers to raster images or bitmapped images.  - A wavelet is a wave-like oscillation with an amplitude that begins at zero, increases, and then decreases back to zero. It can typically be visualized as a \\"brief oscillation\\" like one recorded by a seismograph or heart monitor. Generally, wavelets are purposefully crafted to have specific properties that make them useful for signal processing. Wavelets can be combined, using a \\"reverse, shift, multiply and integrate\\" technique called convolution, with portions of a known signal to extract information from the unknown signal.  - Lossless JPEG is a 1993 addition to JPEG standard by the Joint Photographic Experts Group to enable lossless compression . However , it might be used as an umbrella term to refer to all lossless compression schemes developed by the Joint Photographic Expert group . They include JPEG 2000 and JPEG - LS . Lossless JPEG was developed as a late addition to JPEG in 1993 , using a completely different technique from the lossy JPEG standard . It uses a predictive scheme based on the three nearest ( causal ) neighbors ( upper , left , and upper - left ) , and entropy coding is used on the prediction error . The standard Independent JPEG Group libraries can not encode or decode it , but Ken Murchison of Oceana Matrix Ltd. wrote a patch that extends the IJG library to handle Lossless JPEG . Lossless JPEG has some popularity in medical imaging , and is used in DNG and some digital cameras to compress raw images , but otherwise was never widely adopted .  - Image quality is a characteristic of an image that measures the perceived image degradation (typically, compared to an ideal or perfect image). Imaging systems may introduce some amounts of distortion or artifacts in the signal, so the quality assessment is an important problem.  - A filename extension is an identifier specified as a suffix to the name of a computer file. The extension indicates a characteristic of the file contents or its intended use. A file extension is typically delimited from the filename with a full stop (period), but in some systems it is separated with spaces.  - The objective of image compression is to reduce irrelevance and redundancy of the image data in order to be able to store or transmit data in an efficient form.  - In information technology, lossy compression or irreversible compression is the class of data encoding methods that uses inexact approximations and partial data discarding to represent the content. These techniques are used to reduce data size for storage, handling, and transmitting content. Different versions of the photo of the cat above show how higher degrees of approximation create coarser images as more details are removed. This is opposed to lossless data compression (reversible data compression) which does not degrade the data. The amount of data reduction possible using lossy compression is often much higher than through lossless techniques.  - In signal processing, data compression, source coding, or bit-rate reduction involves encoding information using fewer bits than the original representation. Compression can be either lossy or lossless. Lossless compression reduces bits by identifying and eliminating statistical redundancy. No information is lost in lossless compression. Lossy compression reduces bits by removing unnecessary or less important information. The process of reducing the size of a data file is referred to as data compression. In the context of data transmission, it is called source coding (encoding done at the source of the data before it is stored or transmitted) in opposition to channel coding.  - The Joint Bi-level Image Experts Group (JBIG) is a group of experts nominated by national standards bodies and major companies to work to produce standards for bi-level image coding. The \\"joint\\" refers to its status as a committee working on both ISO and ITU-T standards. It is one of two sub-groups of ISO/IEC Joint Technical Committee 1, Subcommittee 29, Working Group 1 (ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 29/WG 1), whose official title is \\"Coding of still pictures\\".  - JBIG is an early lossless image compression standard from the Joint Bi-level Image Experts Group, standardized as ISO/IEC standard 11544 and as ITU-T recommendation T.82 in March 1993. It is widely implemented in fax machines. Now that the newer bi-level image compression standard JBIG2 has been released, JBIG is also known as JBIG1. JBIG was designed for compression of binary images, particularly for faxes, but can also be used on other images. In most situations JBIG offers between a 20% and 50% increase in compression efficiency over the Fax Group 4 standard, and in some situations, it offers a 30-fold improvement.  - Lossless compression is a class of data compression algorithms that allows the original data to be perfectly reconstructed from the compressed data. By contrast, lossy compression permits reconstruction only of an approximation of the original data, though this usually improves compression rates (and therefore reduces file sizes).  - A discrete cosine transform (DCT) expresses a finite sequence of data points in terms of a sum of cosine functions oscillating at different frequencies. DCTs are important to numerous applications in science and engineering, from lossy compression of audio (e.g. MP3) and images (e.g. JPEG) (where small high-frequency components can be discarded), to spectral methods for the numerical solution of partial differential equations. The use of cosine rather than sine functions is critical for compression, since it turns out (as described below) that fewer cosine functions are needed to approximate a typical signal, whereas for differential equations the cosines express a particular choice of boundary conditions.  - Compress is a Unix shell compression program based on the LZW compression algorithm. Compared to more modern compression utilities such as gzip and bzip2, compress performs faster and with less memory usage, at the cost of a significantly lower compression ratio.    What is the relationship between 'lossless jpeg' and 'file format'? Answer:","output":"Lossless JPEG is a type of image compression standard developed by the Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) that enables lossless compression of images. It is an addition to the JPEG standard that uses a completely different technique from the lossy JPEG standard, where no information is lost during compression. Lossless JPEG compresses the image data without introducing any artifacts or degradation in image quality. On the other hand, a file format is a standardized way of organizing, storing, and encoding data in a computer file. It defines the structure and layout of the data and its metadata within the file. In the context of lossless JPEG, the file format refers to the specific structure and organization of the compressed image data. The relationship between lossless JPEG and file format lies in the fact that lossless JPEG is an image compression standard used to produce a compressed image file while maintaining its quality. This compressed image is then stored in a file format that adheres to the specifications of the lossless JPEG standard."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Shay Mitchell Cuts Her Hair Into a Lob Lob lovers, get ready: After providing us with unlimited long hair inspiration for as long as we can remember, Shay Mitchell has decided to switch up her length. The Pretty Little Liars star just let go of what she refers to as her “security blanket,” chopping her cascading waves into a collarbone-length lob — and it’s everything we ever thought it could be. She may have successfully dodged the lob trend for years, but the 29-year-old actress seems to be feeling adventurous, following in the hair footsteps of her lob-loving co-star Lucy Hale by cutting her chest-length locks just below her collarbone. Mitchell’s hairstylist, Chris Appleton, shared the look on Instagram, writing “Chopped shay’s hair” and “Chop chop @shaym new look.” (He’s the same stylist behind Kim Kardashian’s latest hair fakeout, but we think Shay’s is the real deal.) And despite being a long-haired girl for quite some time, Mitchell recently told PeopleStyle that a cut this short wasn’t entirely out of the question. “Would I cut my hair? If it were needed for the role, it’s hair and it’s gonna grow back,” she said of her strands. “Maybe that would be a new challenge for me.

Donetsk, Ukraine (CNN) -- Pro-Russian activists and Ukrainian riot police clashed Thursday inside the compound of the prosecutor's office in the eastern city of Donetsk, as simmering tensions escalated into violence. As a result of the clashes, 26 people sought medical help, four of them for gunshot wounds, the Donetsk regional administration's health department said. Two remain hospitalized. At least one police officer was injured in the clashes, the Ukrainian Interior Ministry said, adding that shots were fired and small grenades and stones were used in the attack. Police fired tear gas and stun grenades in an effort to disperse the activists, who were armed with clubs, batons and shields but did not appear to be carrying firearms.

Q:I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person that is married to Rachel? ?  Joseph Krauzenberg is a very wealthy Hungarian Jewish industrial tycoon whose fortune is mirrored in the great palaces he owns. However, by 1944 his important businesses are needed by the Nazis and Hitler's 'Final Solution' is sweeping through Europe. The Nazis are greedy to accumulate wealth as easily as possible, and under the terms of the Third Reich's \\"Europa Plan\\", Krauzenberg arranges with Nazi leaders to exchange his fortune, his business holdings (textile plants, steel mills, ownership of several banks) and a collection of rare art for safe passage to Switzerland for himself, his wife Rachel, and their family. As the night of transaction approaches, Krauzenberg visits his large family being held by the Gestapo, and reassures them that all will be safe. Such is Krauzenberg's wealth and power that when he agrees to sign over his property, it is two of the most powerful men in the Nazi regime who announce they will be coming to his house to handle the paperwork – Adolf Eichmann and Heinrich Himmler. However, as the Nazi leaders are ushered into Krauzenberg's home, they are struck by something unusual – his two most trusted servants, Hans Vassmann and his wife Ingrid are a married Aryan couple who, despite the law, are still working for Jews.

Help as much as you can. You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task. In this task you are expected to provide an SQL statement from an english description of what that SQL statement does. The description may include multiple steps but you should only ouput one SQL statement that accomplishes every step. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \\"SELECT\\" statement. Next, you use a \\"FROM\\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \\"AS\\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \\"AS\\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \\"JOIN\\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \\"ON\\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \\"WHERE\\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \\"GROUP BY\\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \\"HAVING\\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \\"ORDER BY\\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \\"DESC\\" statement will sort in descending order and the \\"ASC\\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \\"LIMIT\\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \\"*\\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned.

Q: Fact 1: When a cooler object touches a warmer object , thermal conduction occurs.  Fact 2: When the glacier moves into warmer areas the ice melts and sediments are deposited.  Given the two facts above, glaciers melt via? Choose from: I. vaporization; II. thermal conduction; III. Water expanding; IV. colder temperatures; V. mountain sources; VI. internal combustion; VII. decreased wind; VIII. Physical weathering; A:","output":"Glaciers primarily melt via II. thermal conduction and VIII. physical weathering. II. Thermal conduction: When a cooler object (the glacier) comes into contact with a warmer object (for example, warmer air or ground temperature in lower elevations), thermal conduction occurs. The temperature difference between the colder glacier and its warmer surroundings causes heat to flow from areas of higher temperature to areas of lower temperature until an equilibrium is reached. This transfer of heat energy results in the melting of the glacier. VIII. Physical weathering: Physical weathering refers to the processes by which rocks and other solid materials are broken down due to external factors such as temperature changes, freeze-thaw cycles, and biological activity. In the case of a glacier, the surrounding rocks and sediment may expand and contract due to fluctuations in temperature. Over time, as these changes occur repeatedly, they cause the rocks and sediment to fracture and break, which can further contribute to the glacier's melting. When a glacier moves into warmer areas, the processes of thermal conduction and physical weathering act together to cause the ice to melt and sediments to be deposited on the surrounding landscape. While other factors such as vaporization (I), water expanding (III), colder temperatures (IV), mountain sources (V), internal combustion (VI), and decreased wind (VII) may play a role in the wider context of glacial processes, they are not the primary drivers of glacier melting."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The movie opens with shots from the Spanish Civil War, and a line of Spanish refugees crossing the border into France after defeat by the Francoists. Republican guerrilla fighter Manuel Artiguez turns away from the border and back towards Spain. His friends stop him, saying \\"Manuel, the war is over!\\". The story returns twenty years later, to a young boy named Paco, who asks a man named Pedro why Artiguez, who is legendary for his fierce resistance to Franco even after the defeat of the Republicans, has stopped his guerrilla raids against the Francoists in Spain. Pedro sends Paco into France to find his uncle and Artiguez. Paco tells Artiguez that he wants him to kill Viñolas, a Guardia Civil officer, for killing his father. Paco lets Artiguez know that his father was killed because he wouldn't tell the police where to find Artiguez, whom Viñolas must capture if he is to retain his rank in the Guard.  Meanwhile, Viñolas has learned that Artiguez's mother is dying, and sets a trap at the hospital in San Martín to capture Artiguez, presuming that he will come to see his mother. Like all Republican sympathizers, she is contemptuous and deeply suspicious of all Catholic clergy, who collaborated with the fascist Franco regime, both during and after the war.

However, this does not provide any information about whether the reporters have actually testified in court or not. 2. \\"Yet another motion to quash or for alternative relief was filed by the reporters through Mr. Benn's office.\\" This statement informs us that the reporters have filed a motion to either quash (i.e., to dismiss the subpoenas) or for alternative relief, meaning they could be seeking some form of legal or procedural relief in response to being subpoenaed.

Answer this question: which amendment to the us constitution is most concerned with probable cause??","output":"The Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution is most concerned with probable cause. This amendment is a crucial aspect of the Bill of Rights and seeks to protect the privacy rights of citizens by placing specific requirements on law enforcement agencies for searching or seizing properties and individuals. It states: \\"The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\\" Probable cause, in this context, means that a law enforcement officer must have reasonable grounds to believe that a crime has been or is being committed, based on specific, factual evidence. This standard prevents officers from performing arbitrary searches and seizures by ensuring that there is an adequate basis for obtaining a warrant from a neutral and detached magistrate, who will evaluate the evidence presented to determine if probable cause exists. Additionally, the Fourth Amendment mandates that a warrant describes in detail the specific location to be searched and the persons or items that are the target of the search. This is designed to prevent general warrants, which would allow law enforcement to target individuals without any limitations on the scope of their actions. Over time, the courts have provided further guidance regarding the Fourth Amendment's protections. For instance, the Supreme Court established the exclusionary rule in the landmark Mapp v. Ohio (1961) case, which prohibits evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment from being used in criminal trials. Another famous case, Terry v. Ohio (1968), introduced the concept of \\"stop and frisk,\\" wherein law enforcement officers can briefly detain and search a person if they have reasonable suspicion of involvement in criminal activity, even if the suspicion falls short of probable cause. In conclusion, the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution safeguards citizens' privacy rights by specifying that probable cause is necessary for law enforcement agents to conduct searches and seizures. By emphasizing the importance of having evidence-based reasons for believing that a criminal act occurred or is in progress, the amendment prevents the abuse of power and protects individuals from unreasonable intrusions by the state."},{"instruction":"Given those answer options, answer the question: Nothing I can think of.

After his selection for the restoration, Doubleday commissioned a watercolour painting of the fragments by Thomas H. Shepherd. No account of his restoration survives, but on 1 May he discussed it in front of the Society of Antiquaries of London, and by 10 September he had glued the vase whole again. Only 37 small splinters, most from the interior or thickness of the vase, were left out; the cameo base disc, which was found to be a modern replacement, was set aside for separate display. A new base disc of plain glass, with a polished exterior and matte interior, was diamond-engraved \\"Broke Feby 7th 1845 Restored Sept 10th 1845 By John Doubleday\\". The British Museum awarded Doubleday an additional £25 (equivalent to £2,500 in 2016) for his work.At the time the restoration was termed \\"masterly\\" and Doubleday was lauded by The Gentleman's Magazine for demonstrating \\"skilful ingenuity\\" and \\"cleverness ... sufficient to establish his immortality as the prince of restorers\\".

Write a question about the following article: Still looking for their first win of the season, the Browns went home for a Week 4 AFC North duel with the Cincinnati Bengals in Round 1 of 2009's Battle of Ohio. Due to quarterback Brady Quinn's poor performance in the season thus far, head coach Eric Mangini named quarterback Derek Anderson the starter. Cleveland would trail early in the first quarter as Bengals quarterback Carson Palmer completed a 5-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Chad Ochocinco. The Browns would continue to struggle in the second quarter as defensive end Robert Geathers returned a fumble 75 yards for a touchdown. Cleveland would respond with Anderson completing a 1-yard touchdown pass to tight end Steve Heiden. The Browns would tie the game in the third quarter with Anderson's 1-yard touchdown run. Afterwards, Cleveland would take the lead in the fourth quarter with a 26-yard and a 31-yard field goal from kicker Billy Cundiff. However, Cincinnati answered with Palmer hooking up with Ochocinco again on a 2-yard touchdown run (with a blocked PAT). In overtime, both teams went back and forth with their possessions. In the end, the Bengals emerged victorious with kicker Shayne Graham kicking the game-winning 31-yard field goal. On October 7, the Browns traded WR Braylon Edwards to the New York Jets for WR Chansi Stuckey, LB Jason Trusnik, and third- and fifth- round selections in the 2010 NFL Draft.

The popular internet registration service last week shut down altright.com, a website created by white nationalist leader Richard Spencer and popular with many in the so-called alt-right movement. The takedown is the latest example of how companies like GoDaddy are increasingly responding to growing public pressure to clamp down on violent sites in the wake of the deadly Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, last summer. GoDaddy, which registers domains for more than 75 million websites around the world, said it generally does not delist sites that promote hate, racism and bigotry on the ground that such content is protected as free speech.

Please answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What does the man who tends the hunting lodge threaten to tell the Chicago businessman about?  Rosa Moline is the dissatisfied, restless wife of Lewis, a small-town Wisconsin doctor. She is easily bored, uninterested in her husband's career or in anything to do with her current circumstances. She has long desired a glamorous life, in a world where she can have expensive things and meet truly interesting people. For over a year, she has been having an affair with Neil Latimer, a Chicago businessman who owns the local hunting lodge. Tired of waiting for him to ask her to marry and move to Chicago, Rosa extorts money from Lewis' patients - who often do not have cash but pay him in produce or in other non-financial ways - to finance her trip to the city. Lewis does not yet know about the affair, but he is used to his wife's unease with her life; he discovers the extortion and throws the cash at her, telling her that if she goes to Chicago, she need not come back. Rosa immediately leaves and fully expects Latimer to welcome her. However, he avoids her at first, then when he does meet her, he tells her he is love with another woman and intends to marry. Devastated, Rosa returns to Wisconsin, where Lewis forgives her. She soon becomes pregnant and, briefly, seems to be trying to settle down. During a party for Moose, the man who tends to the hunting lodge, Latimer shows up. He lets Rosa know that he has changed his mind and wants to marry her. Moose overhears the couple planning for her divorce and their marriage; the next day, as everyone is heading out on a hunting trip, Moose bets that her lover will not want the baby and advises Rosa that she had better tell Latimer about it, or he will. To prevent that eventuality, she shoots and kills Moose during the hunt. She is acquitted of this act by claiming she thought he was a deer.

Background: Renaissance are an English progressive rock band, best known for their 1978 UK top 10 hit \\"Northern Lights\\" and progressive rock classics like \\"Carpet of the Sun\\", \\"Mother Russia\\", and \\"Ashes Are Burning\\". They developed a unique sound, combining a female lead vocal with a fusion of classical, folk, rock, and jazz influences. Characteristic elements of the Renaissance sound are Annie Haslam's wide vocal range, prominent piano accompaniment, orchestral arrangements, vocal harmonies, acoustic guitar, bass guitar, synthesiser, and versatile drum work. The band created a significant following in the northeast United States in the 70s, and that region remains their strongest fan base. Context: As The Yardbirds were transforming into The New Yardbirds (with Jimmy Page) in 1968 and then Led Zeppelin, departing members Keith Relf and Jim McCarty formed an acoustic duo called Together.  They released \\"Henry's Coming Home\\" b/w \\"Love Mum And Dad\\" as a single on Columbia Records in November 1968 without chart success.  In January 1969, Relf and McCarty organised a new group devoted to experimentation with rock, folk, and classical forms. In his book Mountains come out of the sky: an illustrated history of prog rock, Will Romano quoted McCarty:  This quintet -- Relf on guitar and vocals, McCarty on drums and vocals, plus bassist Louis Cennamo, pianist John Hawken, and Relf's sister Jane as an additional vocalist -- released a pair of albums on Elektra (US) and Island (UK-ILPS 9112), the first one, titled simply Renaissance, being produced by fellow ex-Yardbird Paul Samwell-Smith.  The band had begun performing in May 1969, before recording had commenced for the debut LP, mostly in the UK, but with occasional forays abroad, including festivals in Belgium (Amougies, October 1969) and France (Operation 666 at the Olympia in January 1970, and Le Bourget in March 1970, both in Paris). In February 1970 they embarked on a North American tour, but that month-long trek proved only marginally successful. Because of their Yardbirds credentials, they found themselves paired with bands such as The Kinks and their new classically oriented direction did not always go down well because audiences were expecting rock/blues-based material.  Beginning in the late spring of 1970 as touring began to grind on them, the original band gradually dissolved. Relf and McCarty decided to quit performing, and Cennamo joined Colosseum. Hawken organised a new line-up to fulfill contractual obligations to Island Records and complete the band's second album, Illusion which had been left unfinished. Question: Did they ever tour?. Whats the answer?","output":"Yes, Renaissance did tour. In May 1969, the band began performing mostly in the UK, with occasional appearances in Belgium and France. In February 1970, they embarked on a North American tour for a month.

You are presented with the quiz \\"What is essential for cellular respiration for organisms consuming VOAs and alcohols?\\"   But you don't know the answer, so you turn to your teacher to ask for hints. He says that \\"oxygen is essential for cellular respiration for all aerobic organisms\\" and \\"aerobic organisms consume VOAs and alcohols\\".   So, what's the best answer to the question? Answer:","output":"The best answer to the question \\"What is essential for cellular respiration for organisms consuming VOAs and alcohols?\\" is oxygen.  To understand why oxygen is the essential component for cellular respiration in organisms consuming volatile organic acids (VOAs) and alcohols, it is important to first comprehend the role of oxygen in the process of cellular respiration and the characteristics of aerobic organisms. Cellular respiration is the process by which cells generate energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) by breaking down organic molecules, such as glucose, fatty acids, or amino acids. There are two main types of cellular respiration: anaerobic respiration, which occurs without the presence of oxygen, and aerobic respiration, which requires oxygen to function. Aerobic respiration is a more efficient process than anaerobic respiration, as it produces more ATP per molecule of substrate. Aerobic organisms, which include the majority of plants, animals, fungi, and protists, are organisms that use oxygen to carry out cellular respiration. These organisms have evolved to depend on the presence of oxygen for energy production, as it enables them to efficiently break down organic molecules for energy. When aerobic organisms consume volatile organic acids (VOAs) and alcohols as energy sources, they still require oxygen to metabolize these substrates. VOAs, such as acetate and propionate, are converted into acetyl-CoA, which can then enter the citric acid cycle (also known as the Krebs cycle or the TCA cycle). Alcohols, such as ethanol, are first converted to acetaldehyde and then to acetate by alcohol dehydrogenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase enzymes, respectively, before entering the citric acid cycle as acetyl-CoA as well. The citric acid cycle, which is a central component of aerobic cellular respiration, relies on the presence of oxygen. When acetyl-CoA produced from VOAs and alcohols enters the citric acid cycle, high-energy electrons are transferred to carrier molecules, such as NAD+ and FAD, to form NADH and FADH2, respectively. These electron carriers subsequently donate their high-energy electrons to the electron transport chain in the inner mitochondrial membrane, where the final electron acceptor is molecular oxygen (O2). Oxygen accepts these high-energy electrons, allowing the transport chain to pump protons (H+) across the inner mitochondrial membrane, creating a proton gradient. This gradient drives the enzyme ATP synthase to synthesize ATP. As a result, oxygen is essential for the completion of aerobic cellular respiration and the efficient generation of ATP. Based on the provided hints that \\"oxygen is essential for cellular respiration for all aerobic organisms\\" and \\"aerobic organisms consume VOAs and alcohols,\\" it can be concluded that oxygen is the best answer to the question. Oxygen is the key component required for cellular respiration when organisms consume VOAs and alcohols, as these substrates ultimately participate in the oxygen-dependent process of aerobic cellular respiration in order to generate energy in the form of ATP."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The \\"prep\\", Steve, is still bitter after his best friend Jamie, the \\"jock\\", had sex with Lisa, a girl with whom Steve was smitten and even took to their senior prom. After Steve and his friends Joey, Patrick, and A.J. harass the \\"tranny\\", Sam, they are chastised by Jamie. This leads to a brawl between Steve's team and Jamie's. Lisa breaks up the fight by dropping a bowling ball on Steve's foot just as Steve is about to kick Jamie again. Egerton, brandishing a shotgun, tells the teenagers to leave and they can continue their tournament the following night. Lisa, having forgot her purse in the arcade, returns to find Steve and his friends waiting for her. Steve proceeds to violently rape Lisa while the others watch. Egerton is oblivious to Lisa's cries for help, as he is downstairs cleaning up the mess the teenagers made. After he is finished raping Lisa, Steve leaves the room. While Steve is gone, A.J. anally rapes Lisa on the pool table; then it's Joey who abuses her. Patrick, who believed the three were only going to \\"scare\\" Lisa, refuses to participate in the rape. Steve returns with a bowling pin and prepares to insert it into Lisa before Patrick intervenes. Steve retorts by giving Patrick the pin and ordering him to do it himself. Patrick refuses to do so at first but complies when Steve threatens to do the same to him. In the end Patrick penetrates Lisa with the bowling pin as she screams in pain.

My friends and I went to see the Gin Blossoms in 1993 at a small venue in Chicago. We were having some beers and enjoying the opening band (they were okay, but not memorable) when this guy came and stood right in front of my roommate. I mean, the floor was filling up, sure, but we’d landed a decent spot right in the middle and he came and stood right in front of her when there was plenty of room off to the side a bit. My roommate and our friend and I looked at each other and were like, “How rude!” Frankly, I was surprised my roommate didn’t do or say anything - holding her tongue wasn’t her forte. I half expected her to spank his bottom - I’d seen her do it before to get some guy’s attention, and this guy was pretty cute. But when that same song came to an end, the guy turned around and actually apologized to all of us. He held up his camera and said he wanted a really good shot of the band as they were friends of his. He actually went and bought each of us a beer, so it totally worked out well. We thanked him and he took off. The only excuse I have for us is that we were in college and not glued to MTV or entertainment magazines, and really, only Hey Jealousy had hit the airwaves when we went to the concert. But sure enough, when the Gin Blossoms took the stage, Robin Wilson gave a shout out to those three girls he’d blocked the stage for earlier and hoped we’d enjoyed our beers. Like I said, it’s pretty tame, but I thought he handled it with class, so it’s always made me remember their music fondly. Question: what is true about the girls Answer: Answer:","output":"The girls, who were attending the Gin Blossoms concert in 1993 at a small venue in Chicago, were college students and not avid followers of entertainment news or MTV. They had a good spot near the middle of the venue and were enjoying the opening band when a guy stood right in front of one of them, blocking their view. They found it a bit rude initially but were surprised when the guy later apologized, explained that he was friends with the band, and wanted a good photo. He even bought each of the girls a beer, which they appreciated. Later, when the Gin Blossoms took the stage, the lead singer, Robin Wilson, gave a shout out to the girls and hoped they enjoyed their beers.

Answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the original name of the person who was involved with many young immigrant artists and the Dada movement?  André Kertész (French: [kɛʁtɛs]; 2 July 1894 – 28 September 1985), born Kertész Andor, was a Hungarian-born photographer known for his groundbreaking contributions to photographic composition and the photo essay. In the early years of his career, his then-unorthodox camera angles and style prevented his work from gaining wider recognition. Kertész never felt that he had gained the worldwide recognition he deserved. Today he is considered one of the seminal figures of photojournalism.Expected by his family to work as a stockbroker, Kertész pursued photography independently as an autodidact, and his early work was published primarily in magazines, a major market in those years. This continued until much later in his life, when Kertész stopped accepting commissions. He served briefly in World War I and moved to Paris in 1925, then the artistic capital of the world, against the wishes of his family. In Paris he worked for France's first illustrated magazine called VU. Involved with many young immigrant artists and the Dada movement, he achieved critical and commercial success. Due to German persecution of the Jews and the threat of World War II, Kertész decided to emigrate to the United States in 1936, where he had to rebuild his reputation through commissioned work. In the 1940s and 1950s, he stopped working for magazines and began to achieve greater international success. His career is generally divided into four periods, based on where he was working and his work was most prominently known.  They are called the Hungarian period, the French period, the American period and, toward the end of his life, the International period. Answer:","output":"The original name of the person who was involved with many young immigrant artists and the Dada movement is Kertész Andor. He later changed his name to André Kertész, which he used throughout his career as a Hungarian-born photographer. Kertész was known for his significant contributions to photographic composition and the photo essay, and is considered one of the seminal figures of photojournalism.

Background: The Jay Leno Show is an American talk show created by and starring Jay Leno. Premiering on NBC on September 14, 2009, the program aired on weeknights at 10:00 p.m. ET/PT through February 9, 2010. The program was modeled upon the format of a late night talk show--specifically, Jay Leno's incarnation of The Tonight Show, opening with a comedic monologue, followed by interviews with celebrity guests and other comedy segments. Sketches from The Tonight Show (including Headlines and Jaywalking) were carried over to The Jay Leno Show, along with new sketches. Context: Leno did not expect his show to beat competing first-run episodes, but to do better than reruns, in part because topical jokes benefit from the \\"immediacy\\" of the time slot versus 11:30 pm. A television analyst predicted that Leno would finish in \\"a safe third place\\" every night. NBC research before the show's debut indicated that fans of Leno would watch Leno two to three times a week.  NBC saw a 1.5 rating for the show in the 18-49 demographic as \\"viable\\" and a 1.8 as a \\"home run\\". NBC told Leno that at a 1.5 rating, NBC makes 300 million a year. Tonight at 11:30 pm earned about a 1.3 to 1.5; the television audience at 10 pm is 40% larger than at 11:30 pm, and the network hoped Leno's audience would also grow. Industry observers have cited a range of ratings, from 1.7 to 2, as being necessary for the show to succeed at 10 pm. By comparison, 2.5 is generally necessary for a 10 pm drama to succeed; those that earned a 1.7 or less during the 2008-2009 season were generally cancelled. NBC's prime-time dramas averaged about 2 during 2008-2009.  The first episode of The Jay Leno Show earned \\"fast national\\" estimates of 17.7 million viewers, an 11 Nielsen rating (5.1 among persons 18-49) and an 18 share, significantly above both his Tonight finale and the debut of The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien in all categories. By the second week and competing against season premieres, the audience fell to six million viewers, still on par with or exceeding NBC projections. As of November 1, 2009, The Jay Leno Show has averaged a 1.98 in the adults 18-49 ratings and 6.594 million viewers. During the week before Christmas, the ratings dropped to 1.4 during the week. Prior to the controversy regarding the move of the Jay Leno Show to 11:35 p.m., viewership bottomed out at 4.799 million viewers, although there was a slight bump as word of the controversy broke.  Though the show had been meeting the network's projections for the show itself, it has been severely detrimental to the ratings of the late local news on NBC affiliates. Several stations across the country have seen what is known as the \\"Leno Effect\\", where the lower audience for Leno (as compared to NBC's scripted prime time offerings) translated directly into a domino effect of severe audience drops for late local news (on the order of 25-30%), effects that NBC had underestimated. Question: Did the ratings stay this way?. Whats the answer?","output":"In order to provide an accurate response to the user's question about the ratings of The Jay Leno Show, I would have to gather more recent data or additional information beyond the provided context. The context only details the show's ratings up until November 2009 and mentions a controversy regarding a move to 11:35 p.m., but it doesn't specify the outcome or any subsequent changes in the ratings.  Here's a step-by-step rundown of the task: 1. Identify the question: The query is about the ratings of The Jay Leno Show. Did they maintain the same level as reported in the context, which goes up until November 2009? 2. Analyze the context: The context provides detailed information about the ratings until November 2009. It mentions a decline in ratings and also a controversy surrounding a schedule change. However, it doesn't provide any information about the show's ratings beyond this point. 3. Identify information gap: The context doesn't provide information about the ratings following the controversy and beyond November 2009. 4. Formulate response based on analysis and information gap: Given the available context, I cannot definitively answer whether the ratings remained the same after November 2009 without more recent or additional information. So, I'd respond to the user: \\"Based on the provided context, the ratings information for The Jay Leno Show is only available up until November 2009, which mentions a ratings decline. There is also mention of a controversy about a change in schedule, but the context doesn't provide details about the outcome of this or how the ratings were affected afterward. To find out whether the ratings stayed the same, we would need more recent or additional information beyond what's provided in the context\\"."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

POSTER 1: In my view, mobile phones are only a tool for communication purpose, just like any other tools which have the potential   to be misused. In my opinion, I can see young people using it for security reason, emergency purpose, etc. If the parents can afford to pay big phone bills for their kids, well, that's their business, like the old saying goes, _  --- Mary Smith POSTER 2: From psychological   point of view, teenagers are more likely to be relaxed or pleasure-oriented. They would like to make something different. Buying brands that are considered \\"COOL\\" is important to them. They want others to like and admire themselves, and sometimes, even exaggerate their own personality to show off. This can be seen as a kind of psychology during this certain range of age. --- Dick Gates Currently, people should tend to be more sociable, and age should not be seen as a barrier for teenagers to own their phones. They also need to set trends on the social circuit  . But here parents should play an important role in controlling their children about how to use the phones more properly. Options: A Supportive.

Please answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: The population of what had increased by 40% in 1901?  The arrival of the Manchester Ship Canal in 1894, and the subsequent development of the Trafford Park industrial estate in the north of the town – the first planned industrial estate in the world – had a substantial effect on Stretford's growth. The population in 1891 was 21,751, but by 1901 it had increased by 40% to 30,436 as people were drawn to the town by the promise of work in the new industries at Trafford Park.During the Second World War Trafford Park was largely turned over to the production of matériel, including the Avro Manchester heavy bomber, and the Rolls-Royce Merlin engines used to power both the Spitfire and the Lancaster. That resulted in Stretford being the target for heavy bombing, particularly during the Manchester Blitz of 1940. On the nights of 22/23 and 23/24 December 1940 alone, 124 incendiaries and 120 high-explosive bombs fell on the town, killing 73 people and injuring many more. Among the buildings damaged or destroyed during the war were Manchester United's Old Trafford football ground, All Saints' Church, St Hilda's Church, and the children's library in King Street. Smoke generators were set up in the north of the town close to Trafford Park in an effort to hide it from enemy aircraft, and 11,900 children were evacuated to safer areas in Lancashire, Cheshire, Derbyshire, and Staffordshire, along with their teachers and supervisors. A memorial to those residents who lost their lives in the bombing was erected in Stretford Cemetery in 1948, over the communal grave of the 17 unidentified people who were killed in the blitz of December 1940.Between 1972 and 1975, what is now a closed B&Q store in Great Stone Road was the 3,000-capacity Hardrock Theatre and Village Discothèque, hosting some of that period's major artists in their prime. Led Zeppelin, David Bowie, Bob Marley, Elton John, Hawkwind, Yes, Chaka Khan, Curved Air and Lou Reed were amongst those who appeared. Tangerine Dream was the last band to perform at the Hardrock, on 19 October 1975. In more recent years, Lancashire...

Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: Scooby Doo, Shaggy, Daphne, Velma, Fred, and the Mystery Machine are vacationing in Australia. After sight-seeing in Sydney, they head for the Outback to attend the Vampire Rock Music Festival. Legend says that Vampire Rock is the home of the Yoweeyahoo, an ancient Australian vampire.The events of last year's festival are making Malcolm, Daniel, and co-promoter Russell very nervous. Following the festival, one of the bands called Wild Wind went camping on Vampire Rock and were never heard from again. Rumor has it that all three were kidnapped by the Yoweeyahoo and turned into vampires. Now, strange things are happening at this year's festival--sounds, lights, and smoke are issuing from Vampire Rock. And last night three vampires (who look like the members of Wild Wind) swooped down and carried off the band members of Matt Marvellous. Most of the finalists have pulled out of the contest and are going home.When Scooby and his party arrive at Vampire Rock, they are warmly greeted by their friends, the Hex Girls, who are scheduled to open the show. Sensing a mystery to be solved, Fred, Daphne, and Velma decide to form a rock group themselves and go undercover as The Meddling Kids.Next band to arrive is the Bad Omens and their rather shady manager, Jasper Ridgeway.

Yet this is just the tip of an iceberg when it comes to UK firms owned by Indian businesses. The visit to the UK by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, which starts on Thursday, comes at a time when India is emerging as perhaps the strongest player among the so-called Bric nations - Brazil, Russia, India and China. While the Brazilian, Chinese and Russian economies are all showing signs of slowing, India is booming. Shielded from China's slowdown thanks to its huge domestic market, India's economy is growing at a rate of 7% per year, putting it neck and neck with the Chinese. And some of that Indian growth is finding new markets in the UK. According to a report earlier this year from government department UK Trade & Investment (UKTI), India is now the third-largest source of foreign direct investment into the UK. In 2014 alone, investment from India into the UK increased by 64%, and is now almost level with France, the UK's second-largest investor after the US. Throughout last year, India invested in 122 projects in the UK, compared with 124 for France and 564 for the US. This meant that Indian investment created 7,730 new UK jobs in 2014, and safeguarded a further 1,620, said UKTI. Meanwhile, the UK India Business Council, the non-profit body that aims to boost trade and business links between the two countries, estimates that the total value of Indian investment in the UK in the 2013 to 2014 financial year totalled £1.89bn. Overall there are now more than 800 Indian-owned businesses in the UK, employing more than 110,000 people. In addition to Tata Motors, Indian IT firms Infosys and Wipro have UK operations. Meanwhile, sister Tata business, Tata Global Beverages, owns best-selling Tetley Tea; and Tata Steel has significant UK operations, despite recently announced job cuts due to falling demand and cheaper steel from China. Alpesh Patel, of London-based private equity business Praefinium Partners, says that while the success of companies such as Tata and Infosys is well known, the quality of Indian small to medium-sized enterprises has improved significantly over the past 10 years, and many are looking to enter EU markets using the UK as their gateway. He adds that the ease of doing business in the UK, as well as the English language and familiarity with UK institutions, also makes the UK an attractive proposition for Indian investors. \\"Ease of business here is often overlooked and taken for granted,\\" says Mr Patel. \\"We're used to comparing things in absolute terms - we might say it took ages to fill in a tax return for example - but we don't compare it with the same thing in India where it really is a pain.\\" He adds that one area that particularly appeals to Indian investors is the ease with which they can raise finance in the UK. \\"They're often not looking for money from the UK to go into their company in India, but looking for UK money going into their UK operations. We really overlook the size and strength of our angel investor and venture capital community. \\"Relative to companies in India, we're seen as an absolute haven in terms of access to capital if you've got a good business.\\" Mukesh Rajani, UK India business group leader at accountancy giant PricewaterhouseCoopers, says that besides the EU, the UK's historical connections with the rest of the world, including Africa, are key in attracting Indian investment. He adds that Indian firms are also keen to tap into British hi-tech expertise. \\"Advanced engineering is a big strength for the UK,\\" says Mr Rajani. \\"High-end engineering, high-end advanced services, high-end pharmaceuticals are very interesting areas for Indian companies. \\"Clearly at the high-end what is on offer in Britain is in a different league, and these things would take time for India to develop as it acquires its own talent.\\" Richard Heald, chief executive at the UK India Business Council, says that most of the investment in the UK is in the IT sectors and driven by Mr Modi's policy of making India the world's hub for IT industries. He says: \\"A lot of the growth in indigenous Indian industries has to be sustained through technological development. \\"If Modi's policies are to succeed then it needs to have exposure and involvement with a lot of the technological development, incubation, catapult centres, upstream technology companies that we have here. \\"The Indians naturally look to us for that in the form of joint ventures, or acquisitions, or just investment.\\" Mr Heald highlights pharmaceutical firms Piramal and Cipla as two other Indian businesses that have made significant moves into the UK. 110,000 people are employed by Indian companies operating in the UK 13 Indian companies each employ more than 1,000 people in the UK 65,000 people work for Tata Group, which owns 5 of those 13 companies 28,000 of those work for Tata Motors, which owns Jaguar Land Rover But what about UK investment going into India? Between 2000 and 2015, the UK invested 22.2bn (£14.5bn) in India, accounting for around 9% of foreign direct investment in the country, according to a report by UK business group the CBI. This makes the UK the largest foreign investor in India after Singapore and Mauritius. The CBI study added that in total UK companies are estimated to employ 691,000 people in India. That is 5.5% of the organised private sector workforce. Mr Heald says: \\"We estimate that there's been a 300% increase in the number of British companies setting up there in the past 10 years… there's been a huge acceleration. \\"And the type of company is changing too - it's more e-commerce, services, IT and education.\\" Under India's federal system, individual states are now more competitive, and are seeking inbound investment by cutting red tape, and simplifying the country's notoriously arcane state tax systems. Mr Heald adds: \\"The term 'competitive federalism' is now being bandied around… these states really have to compete for the investment pound.\\" Summary:","output":"India is now the third-largest source of foreign direct investment into the UK, with over 800 Indian-owned businesses - such as Tata Motors, Infosys and Wipro - in the UK employing more than 110,000 people."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Grand Central Market on Broadway is in Downtown L.A. 2. The market is the oldest and largest open-air produce market. However, the second sentence states: 1. The product market on Broadway usually has rotten food. To determine the truthfulness of the second sentence based on the first sentence, let's go step by step: Step 1: Identify if both sentences are talking about the same market. - Both sentences refer to a market on Broadway. The first sentence specifies that it's the Grand Central Market, which suggests they may be talking about the same market. Step 2: Analyze the information given in Sentence 1 and determine if it affects the truth of Sentence 2. - Sentence 1 tells us the age and size of the market but does not provide any information about the quality of the produce or food sold there. Step 3: Review if the information provided is enough to accept or reject the claim in Sentence 2. - Even though both sentences refer to a market on Broadway, without explicit information about the quality of the food sold at the market, we cannot determine if Sentence 2 is true based solely on the information provided in Sentence 1."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Solve 34297*t = 17243*t + 17326*t - 16592 for t.. What is the answer??","output":"Alright, let's solve the equation step by step like we are talking to a five-year-old. Imagine you have a giant box of candies. Now, let's say 34297 candies in the box are all for you (t). On the other side, we have two more boxes. First box has 17243 candies, and the second box has 17326 candies. In both of these boxes, candies are also for you (t). But from these boxes, you had to give away 16592 candies. To find the answer (t), we'll first put the candies from the two boxes together. So, first let's add 17243 candies (first box) and 17326 candies (second box). 17243 * t + 17326 * t = (17243 + 17326) * t = 34569 * t Now we have 34569 candies for you in one box. But remember we need to subtract the 16592 candies we gave away. So, let's see the remaining candies for you now: 34569 * t - 16592 So, to find how many candies you actually get, we need to make both sides of the equation equal. So it will look like this: 34297 * t = 34569 * t - 16592 Now, we will solve the equation by following these 3 steps: 1. Move 34297 * t to the other side, so we only have the 16592 on the left side 2. Find the difference between 34569 * t and 34297 * t 3. Divide the result by the difference Let's solve it step by step: 1. 34569 * t - 34297 * t = 16592 2. (34569 - 34297) * t = 16592 (272) * t = 16592 3. Now, we divide 16592 by 272 to find how many candies you get (t): t = 16592 / 272 t = 61 So, you'll get 61 candies (the answer for t = 61).

Given the question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Every day on the road, accidents are caused. They do not only happen. The reason may be easy to see: an overloaded tray, a shelf out of reach, a patch of ice on the road. But more often than not there is a chain of events leading up to the misfortune-frustration, tiredness or just bad temper-that show what the accident really is, a sort of attack on oneself. Road accidents, for example, happen frequently after a family quarrel, and we all know people who are _ , so often at odds with themselves and the world that they seem to cause accidents for themselves and others. By definition, an accident is something you cannot predict or avoid, and the idea which used to be current, that the majority of road accidents are caused by a minority of criminally careless drivers, is not supported by insurance statistics. These show that most accidents involve ordinary motorists in a moment of carelessness or thoughtlessness. It is not always clear, either, what sort of conditions make people more likely to have an accident. For instance, the law requires all factories to take safety actions and most companies have safety committees to make sure the regulations are observed, but still, every day in Britain, some fifty thousand men and women are absent from work due to an accident. These accidents are largely the result of human error or misjudgment-noise and fatigue, boredom or worry are possible factors which contribute to this. Doctors who work in factories have found that those who drink too much, usually people who have a high anxiety level, run three times the normal risk of accidents at work. Question: The passage suggests that  _  . Options: A: accidents mostly result from slippery roads B: accidents are usually caused by psychological factors C: doctors run three times the normal risk of accidents in factories D: about 50,000 people lost their lives at work in Britain every day The answer is:","output":"B: accidents are usually caused by psychological factors The passage discusses various causes for accidents, including factors that are easy to see, such as an overloaded tray or a patch of ice on the road. However, it also highlights that more often than not, there is a chain of events leading up to accidents which involve factors such as frustration, tiredness, or bad temper. The article further states that road accidents frequently occur after a family quarrel and that some people seem to cause accidents for themselves and others due to their internal conflict and discord with the world. The passage also emphasizes that most accidents involve ordinary motorists in a moment of carelessness or thoughtlessness, suggesting that majority of road accidents are not caused by a minority of criminally careless drivers. This refutes option A, which claims that accidents mostly result from slippery roads. In the context of workplace accidents, the article mentions that despite safety regulations and committees, a significant number of employees are absent from work due to accidents. It points out that human error or misjudgment, often influenced by factors such as noise, fatigue, boredom, or worry, are the primary causes. Moreover, it states that individuals with high anxiety levels who consume alcohol are three times more likely to experience accidents at work. These points further support the idea that psychological factors play a significant role in causing accidents. Option C, which suggests that doctors run three times the normal risk of accidents in factories, is not accurate, as the passage states that people with high anxiety who drink too much are the ones more prone to accidents. Additionally, option D is not supported by the passage, as it refers to 50,000 men and women being absent from work due to accidents daily in Britain, not losing their lives. In conclusion, the passage suggests that accidents are usually caused by psychological factors, making option B the correct answer."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This article: Stefan Lochner (the Dombild Master or Master Stefan; c. 1410 – late 1451) was a German painter working in the late \\"soft style\\" of the International Gothic. His paintings combine that era's tendency toward long flowing lines and brilliant colours with the realism, virtuoso surface textures and innovative iconography of the early Northern Renaissance. Based in Cologne, a commercial and artistic hub of northern Europe, Lochner was one of the most important German painters before Albrecht Dürer. Extant works include single-panel oil paintings, devotional polyptychs and illuminated manuscripts, which often feature fanciful and blue-winged angels. Today some thirty-seven individual panels are attributed to him with confidence. Less is known of his life. Art historians associating the Dombild Master with the historical Stefan Lochner believe he was born in Meersburg in south-west Germany around 1410, and that he spent some of his apprenticeship in the Low Countries. Records further indicate that his career developed quickly but was cut short by an early death. We know that he was commissioned around 1442 by the Cologne council to provide decorations for the visit of Emperor Frederick III, a major occasion for the city. Records from the following years indicate growing wealth and the purchase of a number of properties around the city. Thereafter he seems to have over-extended his finances and fallen into debt. Plague hit Cologne in 1451 and there, apart from the records of creditors, mention of Stephan Lochner ends; it is presumed he died that year, aged around 40. Lochner's identity and reputation were lost until a revival of 15th-century art during the early 19th-century romantic period. Despite extensive historical research, attribution remains difficult; for centuries a number of associated works were grouped and loosely attributed to the Dombild Master, a notname taken from the Dombild Altarpiece (in English cathedral picture, also known as the Altarpiece of the City's Patron Saints) still in Cologne Cathedral.... contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who has thirty-seven individual panels attributed to him with confidence?, what is it ?

Because of the power of shots, the goaltender wears special equipment designed to protect the body from direct impact. The goalie is one of the most valuable players on the ice, as their performance can greatly change the outcome or score of the game.

Geoffrey Braden, a wealthy and influential landowner, lives in a grand manor with his wife, Mrs. Braden, along with their two children, and a small staff of servants. Geoffrey is known for his benevolent nature and has gained the respect and admiration of the villagers. However, dark secrets lurk beneath the surface of the perfect family image. One fateful night, Geoffrey is found brutally murdered in his study by the housemaid, and the entire village is shaken by the tragedy.

As Robert begins his investigation, he digs deeper into the lives of the Bradens and their closest acquaintances, uncovering a twisted web of infidelity, lies, and betrayal. Rumors circulate throughout the town, as people begin to reveal their suspicions of one another. It is discovered that Geoffrey was having an affair with a local woman, and Mrs. Braden was secretly aware of this but held on to her dignified facade.

Article:Members of the UN's heritage committee have gathered in Germany for the start of a three day meeting, where the bridge's nomination will be considered. It has been recommended for approval, with inspectors praising it as an \\"extraordinary milestone in the history of bridge construction\\". A final decision is due to be taken some time before Sunday night. The distinctive red rail bridge spans the Firth of Forth between South Queensferry, on the outskirts of Edinburgh, and North Queensferry in Fife. It opened in 1890 after eight years of construction work, and at 2,529m long was at the time the world's longest multi-span cantilever bridge. Supporters of its bid for World Heritage Status have described it as a masterpiece of human creative genius. Unesco appeared to agree with that assessment in its inspection report, which stated: \\"This enormous structure, with its distinctive industrial aesthetic and striking red colour, was conceived and built using advanced civil engineering design principles and construction methods. \\"Innovative in design, materials, and scale, the Forth Bridge is an extraordinary and impressive milestone in bridge design and construction during the period when railways came to dominate long-distance land travel.\\" World Heritage Sites are those which Unesco considers to have an internationally significant cultural or natural heritage, and whose value is considered to transcend national boundaries.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. gentamicin belongs to which class of antibacterial agents??","output":"Gentamicin belongs to the class of antibacterial agents known as Aminoglycosides. Aminoglycosides are a group of bactericidal antibiotics that work by inhibiting bacterial protein synthesis, leading to the death of susceptible bacteria. They are particularly effective against aerobic Gram-negative bacteria and some Gram-positive bacteria, including Staphylococcus species.  Aminoglycosides share several common structural features, including a central aminocyclitol ring (typically consisting of a six-membered ring) linked to other aminosugars through glycosidic bonds. These aminosugars are essential for the antibiotic action, as they interact with the target ribosomes in bacteria. Gentamicin, like other aminoglycosides, is produced by various species of soil-dwelling, Gram-positive bacteria belonging to the Streptomyces and Micromonospora genera. Gentamicin is derived from the Micromonospora genus, specifically, Micromonospora purpurea.  The mode of action for gentamicin and other aminoglycosides involves binding to the bacterial 16S rRNA within the 30S ribosomal subunit. This binding causes misreading of the genetic code during translation, leading to the production of nonfunctional or toxic proteins within the bacterial cell. In addition, aminoglycosides interfere with the proper formation of the ribosomal initiation complex, also hampering protein synthesis. These two actions come together to disrupt the bacterial protein synthesis process and ultimately lead to bacterial cell death. Aminoglycosides, including gentamicin, display concentration-dependent bactericidal activity, which means that the more significant the exposure of bacteria to these antibiotics, the greater the efficacy. They are also characterized by a post-antibiotic effect, wherein the bactericidal activity persists even after the antibiotic concentration drops below the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC). It is important to note that gentamicin and other aminoglycosides may have nephrotoxic and ototoxic side effects, making them less desirable options compared to less toxic antibiotics when available. However, their broad-spectrum activities make them valuable tools in the treatment of severe infections, particularly before the pathogen has been identified, or when there is a concern about the possible presence of multidrug-resistant bacteria. They are often used together with other antibiotics, such as penicillins and cephalosporins, to provide synergistic action and broaden the antimicrobial activity against a variety of bacteria."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Summarize this article: He came from simple beginnings as the son of a sharecropper in North Carolina to achieve world-wide fame.      And on Monday morning, the life of the humble and reserved Joe Frazier was remembered with elegance and passion in a two-hour ceremony at North Philadelphia's Enon Tabernacle Baptist Church.      Mr. Frazier, who moved to Philadelphia as a teenager, died Monday of liver cancer. He was 67.      Longterm adversary Muhammad Ali paid his respect to the former heavyweight champion, along with fellow boxers Bernard Hopkins, Larry Holmes and Michael Spinks, among other.      Ali was in visibly poor shape, clearly stricken from Parkinson's disease.      Mr. Frazier's white casket was placed in front of the alter draped in a tapestry and adorned by various bouquets of flowers. The heavyweight tile belt he won by defeating Ali in 1971's \\"Fight of the Century\\" sat atop the casket.      A 100-member choir sang hymns, while the preachers urged the crowd to rise from their seats and create an energetic scene.      The Rev. Jesse Jackson addressed the bi-level gathering along with other religious leaders from Philadelphia. The Rev. Al Sharpton was scheduled to speak as well but cancelled Monday morning.      The 46-year-old Hopkins remembered Mr. Frazier as someone who was not only a fighter but a vibrant member of the community. He said the courage Mr. Frazier displayed out of the ring served as an example for his own career.      \\"If you can take a page out of Joe Frazier's book, to get knocked down and get back up,\\" said Hopkins. \\"Be true to what you believe in and what you do no matter what you do. . . . There are going to be challenges, and sometimes they look too big to defeat. But if you're Joe Frazier, you're going to put 100 percent in there.\\"      Hopkins said Mr. Frazier never lost his will and determination to be a leader, fighting for causes that Hopkins said weren't always popular or noteworthy.      \\"When I be remembered, I want to be remembered of what Joe Frazier had done,\\" said Hopkins. \\"If I can do one third of what Joe Frazier has done, then it's only a blueprint for me to leave a legacy.\\"      In his remarks, Jackson chastised the city for not having a statue of Mr. Frazier. He questioned why the city so eagerly celebrated fictional boxer Rocky Balboa and not Mr. Frazier.      \\"Tell them Rocky was not a champion. Joe Frazier was,\\" said Jackson. \\"Tell them Rocky's fist were frozen in stone. Joe's fists were smokin'.\\"      Jackson incited a large cheer from the crowd as he demanded a statue of Mr. Frazier to be erected in Philadelphia.      On Friday, Mayor Nutter said the city was in discussions with the family plans for a lasting memorial.      Don King, who promoted Mr. Frazier's \\"Thrilla in Manila\\" bout with Ali, adorned his three piece suit with an American flag scarf and waived his signature American flag.      He said that the promoting Mr. Frazier \\"was a thrill because he was the embodiment of a heavyweight champion.\\" King said that Mr. Frazier's reserved nature often made him misunderstood.      \\"He was really fighting for freedom, justice and inequality the same as Ali was doing,\\" said King. \\"Only he couldn't articulate it as well as Ali. Therefore, he would use it in a competitive style with the courage and invincible spirit.\\"      King said Monday's ceremony was a day of rejoicing as Mr. Frazier lived a good life and was able to fight for what he believed in.      \\"He thought his way was better than Ali's way because his way was more moderate,\\" said King.      King said Ali's repeated verbal jabs at Mr. Frazier stayed with Mr. Frazier for a long time. The promoter said he would have to mediate between the two as Ali ridiculed Mr. Frazier with racial insults.      Holmes echoed those statements but said Mr. Frazier never showed the way he truly felt. He said Ali's insults hurt him more than anyone, but Mr. Frazier never talked about it.      \\"But, I will,\\" said Holmes.

If it's un-answerable, please output \\"No answer\\".  Question: The next morning, who tours the factory with Ellie and the Kupfers? Movie plot title: Halloween III: Season of the Witch Movie plot: In northern California, on the night of Saturday, October 23, we see a man running down a semi-rural road as the movie opens. Obviously being pursued, the man Harry Grimbridge (Al Berry) runs into a junkyard to try to hide or find help. Then we see his pursuers coming down the road in a car and enter the junkyard. The man tries to hide, to no avail; a well-dressed man who is stronger than he looks confronts him and begins choking him. The resourceful man saves himself by pulling a chock out from under a junked car, which rolls forward and pins his attacker against another car, allowing him to break free. Another well-dressed man (Dick Warlock) gets out of the car, but the pursued man flees across the junkyard on foot to dubious safety.A short distance away, as a storm begins to pass through, a gas station attendant named Walter Jones (Essex Smith) is passing time watching a news report about Stonehenge. The reporter is talking about an unsolved theft from some nine months earlier; someone had stolen a stone weighing several tons from Stonehenge in England and the local police are baffled. The TV cuts to a commercial for Silver Shamrock masks before the storm knocks out the power. Just then, the man from the junkyard bursts into the gas station, clutching a Silver Shamrock Halloween mask, begging for help. The attendant, clearly disturbed, takes the man to the hospital.Meanwhile, not too far away, the recently divorced Dr. Dan Challis (Tom Atkins) stops off at home to see his ex-wife Linda (Nancy Kyes) and their two children. He's late arriving, a not uncommon occurrence with him. He has brought the kids some masks for the upcoming Halloween, but they are disappointed, saying \\"Mom already got us masks\\". They were Silver Shamrock masks. While Dan and his ex are talking, the kids turn on the TV and see another Silver Shamrock commercial, which they seem to enjoy immensely.

Q:Question: The city's community garden was demolished for yet another what? Options: - wasteland - ocean - desert - parking lot - flowers  Explain why a human would choose \\"parking lot\\" to answer the question above: A:","output":"A human would choose \\"parking lot\\" as the answer to the question because it is the most plausible and logical option among the given choices.  Community gardens are urban spaces usually created for recreational gardening, food production, or environmental stewardship purposes, allowing neighborhood residents or visitors to come together and engage with nature. In contrast, the other options mentioned (wasteland, ocean, desert, and flowers) do not make sense in this context and do not hold strong connections with urban development processes. The construction of a parking lot after the demolition of a community garden indicates a shift in priorities toward accommodating vehicles and providing parking spaces for commercial or residential purposes. This is a common occurrence in urban areas as cities grow and the need for transportation infrastructure increases. A human would understand that the development of parking lots and the reduction of green spaces, like community gardens, reflects the ongoing transformation and expansion of urban landscapes. Therefore, \\"parking lot\\" is the most reasonable answer as it best represents the common urban development choice that might lead to the demolition of a community garden."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The given information highlights the retail aspect and consumer spending in London, which is not directly related to the cargo handling capacity of the Port of London. To provide a more suitable answer to the question, one should focus on the statistics related to the cargo throughput and shipping activities at the Port of London. The Port of London, situated along the River Thames, is a crucial logistic hub within the United Kingdom, handling a significant volume of cargo each year. According to data from the Port of London Authority, in 2019, the Port of London handled around 50 million tonnes of cargo, which includes various categories such as containerized goods, automobiles, oil, grains, and other bulk goods. This volume of cargo firmly establishes the Port of London as a critical component in the global shipping industry and, more specifically, the supply chain within the United Kingdom. In conclusion, to answer the question about the annual cargo handling capacity of the Port of London, it is essential to focus on the relevant data pertaining to the volume of goods and materials that pass through the port, rather than discussing the retail aspect within London."},{"instruction":"Q: Given a sentence in Hindi, generate a new Hindi sentence by performing small changes on the sentence.

Later that night, Reese, Ryan, and Ryan's girlfriend Cassidy Spilker sneak into the school, only to run into Pfeifer, who saw Reese's car. Knowing they cannot vandalize the sets with Pfeifer there, the group tries to leave, but finds that they have been locked inside, and there is no cell phone reception.

As the group tries to look for a way out of the school, they find news coverage of Charlie's death that includes an interview with his girlfriend Alexis.

Which soft drink, described as having a unique flavour, was first nationally marketed in the USA in 1904 and has had many advertising slogans including 'what's the worst that can happen' in 2008?","output":"The soft drink you are referring to is Dr Pepper. Dr Pepper is a popular carbonated soft drink that originated in the United States and was first nationally marketed in 1904. With a unique flavor that sets it apart from other soft drinks, it has remained a popular choice amongst consumers throughout the years. Dr Pepper's creation is attributed to Charles Alderton, a pharmacist working at Morrison's Old Corner Drug Store in Waco, Texas. He combined a unique mix of fruit and spice flavors to develop the original syrup, which was then named Dr Pepper by the drugstore's owner, Wade Morrison. The drink quickly gained popularity and began to be sold across the United States starting in 1904. Throughout its history, Dr Pepper has had numerous advertising slogans to promote its distinctive taste. One of the memorable slogans came in 2008 with the tagline, \\"What's the worst that can happen?\\" This particular campaign was designed to encourage consumers to take a chance and try the unique soft drink, emphasizing that they might find they enjoy the taste more than they expect. Other notable advertising slogans for Dr Pepper include: 1. \\"King of Beverages\\" (1904): This early slogan positioned Dr Pepper as a superior drink in the crowded soft drink market. 2. \\"Distinctively Different\\" (1920s-1930s): In an effort to stand out from other soft drinks, this slogan emphasized the drink's unique flavor. 3. \\"The Most Original Soft Drink Ever\\" (1940s): Recognizing that its taste could not be replicated, Dr Pepper used this slogan to highlight its uniqueness. 4. \\"The Friendly Pepper Upper\\" (1950s): This slogan portrayed Dr Pepper as a cheerful and uplifting beverage that can brighten your day. 5. \\"Be a Pepper\\" (1977): The \\"Be a Pepper\\" campaign, which featured the catchy song \\"I’m a Pepper,\\" encouraged people to embrace their individuality and join the Dr Pepper community. 6. \\"Hold Out for the Out of the Ordinary\\" (1980s): The campaign encouraged people to be unique and not settle for anything less than extraordinary. Today, Dr Pepper is owned by the Keurig Dr Pepper company and continues to attract consumers who appreciate the one-of-a-kind taste.

They believed that He was coming again in a very little while during their own life-time, in a few months or years, to make an end of the world and to judge the quick and the dead.  And as they waited for His coming, one generation after another, and yet He did not come, a sadness fell upon them.  Christ seemed to have left the world.  The little while that He had promised to be away seemed to have become a very long while.  Hundreds of years passed, and yet Christ did not come in glory.  And, as I said, a sadness fell on all the Church.  Surely, they said, this is the time of which Christ said we were to weep and lament till we saw Him again--this is the time of which He said that the bridegroom should be taken from us, and we should fast in those days.  And they did fast, and weep, and lament; and their religion became a very sad and melancholy one--most sad in those who were most holy, and loved their Lord best, and longed most for His coming in glory.

What is the answer??","output":"To solve the given equation for 'm', you should first gather all the 'm' terms on one side of the equation and the constant term on the other side if necessary. In this case, all 'm' terms are on one side of the equation and the constant on the other side, so we can directly proceed to the next step. The equation given is -7348 = -5716*m + 5382*m If we simplify the right side of the equation by performing addition/subtraction, we get: -7348 = (-5716 + 5382)*m Hence,  -7348 = -334*m Now, in order to isolate 'm', we should divide -7348 by -334. So, we have: m = -7348 / -334 It's important to remember that dividing two negative numbers gives a positive result. Thus, m = 7348 / 334. Now, by performing the division, we get: ⁠m ≈ 22.01197604790419 So, the solution to the equation -7348 = -5716*m + 5382*m is m ≈ 22.01197604790419."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: I know that the answer to the question \\"What does Adrian Kingsley-Hughes say of his thoughts on the origins of the interface?\\" is in \\"The interface of Windows 8 has been the subject of mixed reaction.

The AP and Google ( GOOG - news - people ) have been debating content and compensation issues for months. In an interview with Forbes on Wednesday, Curley warned that if Google doesn't strike the right deal with the AP soon, \\"They will not get our copy going forward.\\" The threat follows Rupert Murdoch's accusation earlier this month that Google is committing copyright thievery when it borrows material from news stories to assemble search rankings. A few days later, the AP weighed in with a similar charge--though it did not mention Google--announcing a content protection initiative and threatening legal and legislative action against news aggregators. The AP, a 163-year-old cooperative owned by news organizations, won't discuss its talks with Google, but plans to create landing pages and Web-based \\"news maps\\" directing users to original AP stories (and away from secondary sources who post material \\"borrowed\\" from the AP). To do this, the AP needs Google's help. Most likely that means Google creating search protocols similar to those created from the licensing deal the AP inked with Google in 2006. Since that deal was struck, Google has paid the AP undisclosed fees to carry AP content on the Google News section of the site. Search rankings on Google News give priority to recognizable news brands like the AP. But Google applies no such algorithmic discretion to general searches. The broader search rankings spread AP content out across the Web, says Curley, encouraging misappropriation by other sites. Curley wants Google to \\"protect content from unauthorized use and pay us for the longtail.\\" By \\"longtail,\\" Curley refers to the thousands of small sites that collectively drive vast herds of traffic using AP content. A lot has changed online since the AP's initial license deal with Google was struck. Is Curley's threat a re-boot of an earlier tactic?

A spokesman for News Corp said its advice was that \\"there is, to put it at its lowest, a substantial risk that any questions from the committee on the subject you identify would touch on matters relevant to the criminal trial, and a substantial risk that any answers would seriously impede or prejudice the course of justice\\". Murdoch had agreed to appear before the committee when invited in July to answer fresh questions over secret tape recordings of a meeting he had with more than 20 Sun journalists who have been arrested in connection with alleged unlawful payments to police and other public officials for stories. The first trial related to the activities of News International, which is now renamed News UK, is scheduled to start on 28 October and involves eight defendants including Rebekah Brooks, the former chief executive of News International, and David Cameron's former spin doctor, Andy Coulson, who was a former News of the World editor. Brooks and Coulson have pleaded not guilty; their trial is expected to last until mid February. Three more trials have been scheduled to take place after that with the latest pencilled in for June. Summary:","output":"Rupert Murdoch's plans to appear before the UK's culture, media and sport committee for a second time have been postponed due to the intervention of the attorney general and Murdoch's lawyers. The committee was set to question Murdoch on the activities of his British newspaper empire. However, his lawyers advised that he should not submit himself for questioning until all criminal trials related to the News of the World and the Sun are over. With potential appeals and more trials, this could be delayed until 2015. The first trial related to the activities of News International is set to start on October 28th and involves eight defendants, including the former chief executive of News International, Rebekah Brooks, and former News of the World editor, Andy Coulson."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. Answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: There is a lot of misunderstanding about studying. Most students have not been taught the principles behind really effective working. Imagine a graph showing the amount a person learns against the number of hours he works in a day. If he doesn't do any work, he learns nothing (point 0). If he does an hour's work he learns a certain amount (point 1). If he does two hours' work he learns about twice as much (point 2). If he does more work he'll learn still more (point 3). However, if he tries to do twenty-three and a half hours' work in a day, he will be so tired that he'll hardly remember anything: what he learns will be very little (point 4). If he did less work he'd learn more (point 5). Now whatever the exact shape of the graph's curve , made by joining these points, it must have a high point. Point \\"X\\" is the very maximum anyone can learn in the day. And this represents the optimum , the best, amount of work to do. It is the best possible compromise between adequate time at the books and fatigue . Fatigue is an absolutely real thing; one can't escape it or ignore it. If you try to ignore it and press yourself to work past the optimum, you will only get on this downward slope and achieve less than the best - and then become very tired and lose your power of concentration. The skill in being a student consists of getting one's daily study as near the optimum point as possible. I cannot tell you what the optimum is. It differs with the type of work, it differs from person to person, and even in the same person it varies from week to week. You must try to find your own. Every day you study, bear this principle of the optimum in mind. When you feel yourself getting fatigued, if you find yourself reading the same paragraph over and over again and not taking it in, that's a pretty good sign you've reached your highest point for the day and should stop. Most ordinary students find their optimum at five hours a day. Yours may be a little more or a little less - but if you get in five hours' good work a day, you... Answer:","output":"Based on the article about effective studying and the concept of the optimum point, which of the following statements is true? A. Studying for longer hours always leads to learning more. B. Fatigue plays no role in the effectiveness of studying. C. Ignoring fatigue can lead to a decrease in concentration and learning. D. The optimum point of studying is the same for everyone. Answer: C. Ignoring fatigue can lead to a decrease in concentration and learning."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Across the green line we have Amos Gitai of Israel, using his eleven minutes to show a terrorist act and focus on a jerky newscaster. Alejandro González Iñárritu of Mexico concentrated on the Twin Towers but seemed to forget to turn on his camera. Sean Penn not knowing that there were no buildings within the shadow of the Trade Center on 9-11. Shohei Imamura of Japan ignoring the whole thing. Claude Lelouch focussing on a trivial and cliched love affair. Ken Loach of the UK focussing on Chile. Etc. etc.","output":"The sentiment of the given review is overwhelmingly negative. The reviewer expresses discontent and disappointment in the work of various filmmakers, giving the impression they believe their work is low in quality or problematic in its content. Here is a more detailed analysis of the sentiment: 1. The reviewer opens the review by referring to the films as \\"eleven pieces of garbage.\\" This is a strong indicator of negative sentiment, showing a discontentment towards all movies in the series. 2. The sentence \\"Eleven minutes each of sheer tedium, sophistry, condescension, self-indulgence,\\" illustrates a negative sentiment, indicating the reviewer perceives the films as dull, deceptively subtle, patronizing, and self-gratifying. 3. The reviewer seems to be unsatisfied with the treatment of topics by the filmmakers. For example, when mentioning Yussef Chahine's film, the reviewer appears to express disdain for what they perceive as a celebration of terrorism. This indicates a sentiment of disapproval for the director's approach. 4. The reviewer derides Amos Gitai for focusing on a \\"jerky newscaster\\", and criticizes Alejandro González Iñárritu for seemingly forgetting to turn on his camera'. This suggests the reviewer found their contributions to be lacking in quality and substance, again emphasizing a negative sentiment. 5. Regarding Sean Penn's piece, the reviewer indicates inaccuracy in the film's portrayal, further showing dissatisfaction and contributing to the overall negative sentiment. 6. With regard to the piece by Shohei Imamura, the reviewer mentions that he \\"ignored the whole thing\\". Here, the sentiment is again negative due to expressed displeasure in their perceived lack of attention or focus. 7. Regarding Claude Lelouch and Ken Loach, negative sentiment is inferred from comments suggesting that the directors focused on trivial, cliched, or irrelevant aspects in their pieces. In conclusion, the critique communicates a strong negative sentiment towards the filmmakers and their works. The reviewer appears to feel that their work was self-indulgent, irrelevant, inaccurately portrayed, or in poor taste."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: I can use this background: The increase in electrons across the periodic table explains why elements go from metals to metalloids and then to nonmetals from left to right across the table. Look at period 2 in Figure below as an example. Lithium (Li) is a metal, boron (B) a metalloid, and fluorine (F) and neon (Ne) are nonmetals. The inner energy level is full for all four elements. This level has just one orbital and can hold a maximum of two electrons. The outer energy level is a different story. This level has four orbitals and can hold a maximum of eight electrons. Lithium has just one electron in this level, boron has three, fluorine has seven, and neon has eight.  Now, I have a new situation: James is memorizing the periodic table and some of the features of the elements on it. He is currently working on the fourth row which starts with Potassium (K) on the far left and ends with Krypton (Kr) to the far right.  Answer this question please: Given two elements are in the same row of the periodic table, which element will have a higher number of elections, a metal or a nonmetal? Answer:","output":"In the same row of the periodic table, a nonmetal will have a higher number of electrons compared to a metal.  This is because, as you move from left to right across a period, the atomic number (number of protons) increases, and so does the number of electrons. Metals are typically found on the left side of the periodic table, while nonmetals are found on the right side. Elements in between, such as metalloids, have properties of both metals and nonmetals.  Using the fourth row (period 4) as an example, which James is currently studying, we can compare Potassium (K), a metal, to Krypton (Kr), a nonmetal. Potassium has an atomic number of 19, which means it has 19 electrons. Krypton has an atomic number of 36, meaning it has 36 electrons. In this case, Krypton, the nonmetal, has a higher number of electrons than Potassium, the metal."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Q:Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Before my first summer vacation at college, my roommate Ted asked to me to work with him on his father's farm in Argentina. The idea of spending two months in Argentine was exciting. Then I began having second thoughts. I had never been far from New England, and I had been homesick my first few weeks at college. What would it be like in a strange country? What about the language? The more I thought about it, the more the idea worried me.  In the end I turned down the invitation. As soon as Ted asked somebody else to go, I began kicking myself. I had turned down something I wanted to do because I was scared, and had ended up feeling depressed. That unhappy summer taught me a valuable lesson out of which I developed a rule for myself: do what makes you anxious; don't do what makes you depressed.  At the end of my senior year, I began to think about becoming a writer. But my professor was urging me to aim at teaching. I hesitated. The idea of trying to live by writing was a lot scarier than spending a summer in Argentina. Back and forth I went, making my decision, unmaking it. Suddenly I realized that every time I gave up the idea of writing, that downhearted feeling went through me. Giving up on what I really wanted to do depressed me. Right then I learned another lesson. To avoid that kind of depression meant having to bear a certain amount of worry and concern. When I first began writing articles, I was frequently required to interview big names. Before each interview I would get butterflies in the stomach and my hands would shake. One person I particularly admired was the great composer Duke Ellington. On the stage and on television, he seemed the very model of confidence. Then I learned Ellington still got stage fright. If the highly honored Ellington, who had appeared on the bandstand some 10,000 times over 30years, had anxiety attacks, who was I to think I could avoid them? I went on doing those frightening interviews. Then I realized to my astonishment that I was even looking forward to the interviews....

Some aspects of a system's carrying capacity may involve matters such as available supplies of food, water, raw materials, and/or other similar resources. In addition, there are other factors that govern carrying capacity which may be less instinctive or less intuitive in nature, such as ever-increasing and/or ever-accumulating levels of wastes, damage, and/or eradication of essential components of any complex functioning system. Eradication of, for example, large or critical portions of any complex system (envision a space vehicle, for instance, or an airplane, or an automobile, or computer code, or the body components of a living vertebrate) can interrupt essential processes and dynamics in ways that induce systems failures or unexpected collapse. (As an example of these latter factors, the \`\`carrying capacity'' of a complex system such an airplane is more than a matter of available food, or water, or available seating, but also reflects total weight carried and presumes that its passengers do not damage, destroy, or eradicate parts, doors, windows, wings, engine parts, fuel, and oil, and so forth.) Thus, on a global scale, food and similar resources may affect planetary carrying capacity to some extent so long as Earth's human passengers do not dismantle, eradicate, or otherwise destroy critical biospheric life-support capacities for essential processes of self-maintenance, self-perpetuation, and self-repair.

The series was produced by 'Spitting Image Productions' for Central Independent Television over 18 series which aired on the ITV network. The series was nominated and won numerous awards during its run including 10 BAFTA Television Awards, including one for editing in 1989 and two Emmy Awards in 1985 and 1986 in the Popular Arts Category.  - Bo' Selecta! was a British adult sketch show written and performed by Leigh Francis, that lampooned popular culture and was known for its often surreal, abstract toilet humour.  - 2DTV is a British satirical animated television show that was broadcast on ITV in the United Kingdom from October 2001 to December 2004. Lasting a total of five series and thirty three episodes, \\"2DTV\\" became the successor of the popular television series from the 1980s, \\"Spitting Image\\", and the predecessor of ITV satirical animation from 2008, \\"Headcases\\".  - Headcases was an ITV satirical animation show based on current affairs . It employed the same satirical style as Spitting Image , 2DTV and Bo ' Selecta ! but using 3D animation created by UK Visual Effects and animation house Red Vision . Red Vision evolved a series of unique production techniques and a sophisticated animation pipeline to deliver the weekly topical elements of the series to hitherto impossible deadlines . The programme 's only series began on 6 April 2008 , with weekly episodes until 11 May 2008 , airing on Sundays at 10 pm . A seventh episode was televised on Friday , 30 May at 10:30 pm , and an eighth at 10 pm on Sunday , 15 June .

Given the following context:  MSgt Mike Takashima, Col Glenn Stevenson, and 1st Lt John Gregg, all members of the U. S. Air Force Air Rescue Service at Ashiya Air Base, Japan, set out to rescue the survivors of a Japanese ship wrecked in a still-raging storm. As they fly to the site of the wreck, each man recalls a part of his past: Gregg remembers the avalanche caused in Europe when his H-19 Chickasaw helicopter came too close to a mountain. The avalanche subsequently buried alive the group of people whom he was attempting to rescue. The accident has since caused him to fear flying solo. Stevenson, deeply prejudiced against the Japanese, recalls the reason for his hatred: as a civilian pilot in the Philippines prior to World War II, he met and married Caroline Gordon. She and their infant son later died in a Japanese prison camp when they were refused medical supplies which were being saved for Japanese soldiers. Takashima, half-Polish (mother), half-Japanese (father), reminisces about his tragic love affair with Leila, an Algerian girl, when he was an Army paratrooper during World War II. He was unable to stop a bridge from being blown up, a bridge where Leila had run to look for him after learning that his unit was being withdrawn from town. Stevenson, Gregg and Takashima are the crew of the lead aircraft of a flight of two HU-16s dispatched to rescue the Japanese civilians at sea.  When one HU-16 air rescue plane crashes while attempting to land in the treacherous seas, Stevenson refuses to jeopardize his plane for Japanese lives. At the last minute, however, he recalls Caroline's dying plea not to hate; he overcomes his prejudice.  Takashima volunteered to parachute to the life rafts with rescue equipment. Stevenson and Gregg then land the plane at sea and rescue the survivors, but when Stevenson is injured in the landing, Gregg is forced to overcome his fear and handle the dangerous takeoff and the flight back to Ashiya.  answer the following question:  What is the full name of the person that overcomes his prejudice?

Write highlights for this article: Facing the world after an isolating and traumatic experience is often stressful, especially for those who have been away for a long time. Jaycee Dugard is reuniting with her close relatives for the first time in 18 years, after having been found on August 27. Dugard was 11 years old when she was abducted in 1991 from a bus stop in South Lake Tahoe, California. She allegedly was kept in a series of backyard sheds by a convicted sex offender and gave birth to two children in captivity. A bail review hearing is scheduled for Monday in El Dorado County Superior Court in Placerville, California, for Phillip and Nancy Garrido, who face charges related to Dugard's kidnapping. In Illinois, Shannon Wilfong is charged with child abduction, allegedly having forced 6-year-old Richard K. Wilfong Chekevdia to live in seclusion and be hidden, at times in crawl spaces and the attic, for nearly two years, according to court documents. In concealing the boy, Wilfong violated the terms of a court order that granted joint custody of the child to Michael Chekevdia, the documents said. The boy is staying with his father's family under child welfare supervision, according to CNN affiliate WSIL. The situations of Dugard and Chekevdia are extreme cases of people emerging from isolation and returning to the real world. The people who have been away often feel conflicted about leaving the situation they've acclimated to in order to rejoin the loved ones they've left behind, experts not connected to the cases tell CNN. Photos: Missing children who were found. Sometimes children involved in custody disputes are taught to hate their father or mother, and \\"extreme tactics\\" may be used, although usually not to the extent of hiding a child in crawl spaces, said Jay Lebow, psychologist at The Family Institute at Northwestern University. \\"While this case is obviously the rarest of things, other children are certainly exposed to many traumas that have meaning connected to this,\\" Lebow said. The case of Dugard. Dugard is spending time in \\"a secluded place, reconnecting\\" with her mother and younger sister, said her aunt, Tina Dugard, in a statement on behalf of her family. \\"This is a joyful time for my family,\\" she said. \\"Jaycee remembers all of us.\\" But a person in Dugard's situation would most likely have both positive and negative feelings about leaving the only environment she's known for 18 years and coming back to her family, psychologists say. \\"She's going to have a lot of mixed feelings about returning to her family of origin because she's spent almost two decades with a different family,\\" said Margo Napoletano, a child and family psychologist in San Diego, California. After allegedly being confined for 18 years, Dugard probably would find the outside world frightening, Lebow said. \\"You get to know this world you live in -- it may be a terrible world, but it's the world you know,\\" he said. Experts say Dugard may have developed what is known as Stockholm syndrome, in which kidnapping victims identify with their captors. Learning to live with and even like the perpetrator has survival value, Napoletano said, and also explains why someone like Dugard probably would feel somewhat torn about returning to her original family. \\"It's a concept that explains why a kidnapped victim would stay with a perpetrator even though they had an opportunity to leave,\\" she said. \\"They opt to stay because it's their comfort zone.\\" But Johanna Tabin, a psychologist in Glencoe, Illinois, said Dugard's readjustment will depend on how she was treated in captivity. Police said Phillip Garrido, one of her alleged abductors, is believed to be the father of her two daughters, and his relationship to Dugard -- whether he framed their alleged sexual encounters as violent or seductive -- will influence her feelings about leaving that situation, Tabin said. It is also important to know how Dugard felt about her family before she was taken away, Tabin said. \\"Did she secretly mourn them?\\" Tabin asked. \\"Did she feel she stepped on a different planet where she was all of a sudden a grown-up 11-year-old and wasn't being treated anymore like a child?\\" Her family members may have constantly wondered what they could have done differently to prevent the kidnapping, Tabin said. At the same time, someone in Dugard's situation may have asked herself at the outset, \\"Why did they let me get kidnapped?\\" Lebow said. There is an infinite range of responses, but more information about Dugard's feelings growing up and in captivity would inform how she adjusts to her new life, Tabin said. The situation is likely also difficult for Dugard's two daughters, born to her in captivity, who have never met Dugard's family before, Napoletano said. \\"It's basically like a wild child who may have had some contact with civilization, but basically is having to start life all over again, and that may be overwhelming to them at first,\\" she said. Napoletano said she would suggest to a family like Dugard's to be accepting and supportive, and not ask a lot of questions. \\"Go about your daily life as usual for the most part, and take the lead from the therapist, one small step at a time,\\" she said. Lebow advises them against looking for some sudden moment of reconnection, but rather to be loving and patient. Coming back from combat. Dugard's reuniting with her family could also be likened to a soldier coming back from a \\"hellacious war,\\" Lebow said. A recent survey of military spouses of deployed Army soldiers with school-age children found that the return from deployment is the most stressful, according to three-quarters of respondents. Reunification brings excitement and relief, which is sometimes accompanied by emotional conflict, the surveyors said. Read more about the study. In the military, bonds of brotherhood form as people face dangers together, Tabin said. When service members come home, they may find life \\"shallower,\\" and feel that they are not the same people as when they left, she said. In a case where a husband has been away at war and returns to his wife, the desire to understand one another's feelings is fundamental, she said. \\"She wants to be understanding, he wants to be able to shove it aside, then he has nightmares, and she says, 'you're not setting it aside,' \\" Tabin said. \\"Well, consciously he is -- he's not awake when he dreams.\\" Don't force the person who has been away to talk about their experiences, Napoletano said. She also stressed that a family should try to normalize the life of the service member who has returned from war. Waking up in the morning, going grocery shopping, washing clothes and doing other day-to-day activities help create a stable, comforting environment, she said.","output":"Jaycee Dugard was missing for 18 years after she was taken from a bus stop. Now she is back with her family that she didn't see for a long time. It can be scary to come back to a new place after being away for so long. Jaycee has to learn how to live with her old family again and so do her two children, who were born during the time she was gone. People who know a lot about feelings say they should take it slow and be patient with each other as they learn to become a family again."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The situation has fueled speculation and concerns regarding the parties involved and the nature of the matter at hand. Discussions around the extradition of the Nigerian militant have been taking place between Angola and Nigerian authorities, but no formal announcement or confirmation has been given by Angola. This hesitation has raised several questions about the reasons behind Angola's reticence and the relationship between the countries involved. The Nigerian militant, whose identity remains undisclosed, is allegedly involved in various criminal activities, including but not limited to terrorism, insurgency, and organized crime. The extradition would potentially help in curbing criminal activities in both Nigeria and Angola, and ensure regional stability. As Angola continues to withhold information on the matter, the international community is closely following the case and anxiously awaiting Angola's next move. The lack of transparency has led to increased scrutiny and could potentially strain relations between the two countries in the long run. The eventual outcome of this situation depends on Angola's decision to confirm or deny the extradition request, and its underlying rationale. As both countries are part of the international community combating terrorism and organized crime, it is essential for them to work together and uphold their commitments to maintaining peace and security in the region. Until Angola provides a clear stance on the extradition, uncertainty will continue to surround the case, putting pressure on the diplomatic relations between Angola and Nigeria.

So now our equation looks like this: 625*q + 6 = 637*q - 966 2. Next, we want to put all the terms with \\"q\\" on one side.

Don and Alice are happy that their two children are on a school trip to Spain and thus away from the disaster. They allow a young boy to enter the house but the infected have followed him and break in. The others are killed. Don abandons Alice to save himself.Twenty eight weeks later, the infected have all starved to death. An American-led NATO force has secured parts of London and is now allowing the return of English citizens who had been abroad during the outbreak. Among them are Don and Alice's children, Tammy and Andy (Imogen Poots and Mackintosh Muggleton). Everyone lives in the Green Zone, a secured area on the Isle of Dogs, a peninsula on the East End of London. Snipers patrol the rooftops in case of another outbreak. Leaving the Green Zone is forbidden because troops are still cleaning up the corpses that have been rotting for six months. Don manages one of the apartment buildings in the zone. He tells Tammy and Andy that he tried to save their mother but there was no hope. Tammy and Andy decide to sneak out into London and visit their old home to retrieve personal items.

How is \\"Servomechanism\\" said in Russian?","output":"\\"Servomechanism\\" translates to \\"сервомеханизм\\" (servomekhanizm) in Russian. A servomechanism, or a servo, is a closed-loop control system that uses feedback to control the position or motion of an output device such as a motor, valve, or actuator. In Russian, the term \\"сервомеханизм\\" accurately conveys this concept, and refers to the same type of system used in various fields like engineering, robotics, and automation. Similar to servomechanism's function in English, \\"сервомеханизм\\" in Russian is used to describe a system that is designed to accept input signals, compare those signals to a desired output or setpoint, and control the output to reach the desired position or motion. It can work with different types of motors, such as direct current (DC) motors, alternating current (AC) motors, or stepper motors. In both Russian and English, servomechanisms are characterized by their ability to provide high precision, accuracy, and stability in controlling their output, which makes them essential components in many technological applications. They are commonly used in industrial automation, aerospace engineering, and robotics systems, ensuring that equipment functions correctly, efficiently, and with minimal errors. In summary, the term \\"сервомеханизм\\" (servomekhanizm) is the Russian equivalent of \\"servomechanism,\\" referring to a closed-loop control system that uses feedback to maintain precise control over an output device's position, speed, or motion. The term is used in various contexts and industries in Russia, just as it is in English-speaking countries, and conveys the same essential concept of a highly accurate, responsive, and stable control system."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

And I was wondering What will happen to Aubrey? A:","output":"Aubrey's decision to inform her friends about leaving may result in a variety of consequences and potential changes in her relationships and life. Although it is difficult to predict the exact outcome for Aubrey, we can discuss some possible scenarios that could happen based on the information provided.  1. Emotional reactions from friends: As Aubrey has sent text messages informing her friends about her departure, it is likely that her friends will show a range of emotional reactions. These may include expressions of surprise, concern, disappointment, or understanding. Their emotional reactions could be influenced by factors such as the closeness of their relationship with Aubrey, the specific circumstances of her departure, and their personalities. 2. Support from friends: While some of Aubrey's friends may express their disappointment or sadness about her leaving, others might offer their support and understanding. They may encourage her to follow her dreams, wish her the best, or even provide assistance in the form of advice, emotional encouragement, or practical help with her move. 3. Keeping in touch: Depending on the reason behind Aubrey's departure and the strength of her relationships with her friends, she may choose to maintain contact with them. This could include staying in touch through social media, video calls, texting, emails, or even occasionally visiting each other. The distance might affect some friendships, but others might flourish due to the effort both parties make to maintain the connection. 4. New social dynamics: Aubrey's departure could lead to a shift in the social dynamics within her friend group. Some friends may grow closer to one another, while others may drift apart due to the absence of the common connection with Aubrey. This might lead to new social groups forming or a reshuffling of friendships within the existing group. 5. Personal growth for Aubrey: Leaving her friends behind could lead to significant personal growth for Aubrey. She may be faced with new challenges as she adjusts to her new environment, be it a new city, a new job, or a new chapter in her life. These experiences can help her develop new skills, expand her horizons, and gain a fresh perspective on life. It is also possible that her absence from her close friends may lead her to build new relationships and friendships in her new surroundings. 6. Potential feelings of homesickness and loneliness: Aubrey may experience feelings of homesickness and loneliness, missing her friends and the emotional support they provided. These feelings might come in waves and could be more intense during special occasions or when she faces difficulties in her new environment. She might have to work on developing new support systems and coping techniques to navigate the challenges that come with leaving her close friends behind. In conclusion, the outcome of Aubrey's departure on her life and friendships will be influenced by a multitude of factors, such as the specific reason behind her leaving, the strength and type of relationships she has with her friends, and the manner in which both Aubrey and her friends navigate the changes in their lives. While some friendships may be strained, others may evolve into long-lasting, deep connections. Ultimately, Aubrey will likely experience a mix of personal growth, changes in her relationships, and a variety of emotions as she moves forward to the next chapter of her life."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question: Information:  - The National Hockey League (NHL) is a professional ice hockey league currently composed of 31 member clubs. Of the 30 clubs currently playing, 23 are in the United States and 7 in Canada. Headquartered in New York City, the NHL is considered to be the premier professional ice hockey league in the world, and one of the major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada. The Stanley Cup, the oldest professional sports trophy in North America, is awarded annually to the league playoff champion at the end of each season.  - Edward James Livingstone ( September 12 , 1884 -- September 11 , 1945 ) was a Canadian sports team owner and manager . He was the principal owner of the Toronto Shamrocks and the Toronto Blueshirts of the National Hockey Association , where his battles with his fellow owners led them to create the National Hockey League .  - An earl is a member of the nobility. The title is Anglo-Saxon in origin, akin to the Scandinavian form jarl, and meant \\"chieftain\\", particularly a chieftain set to rule a territory in a king's stead. In Scandinavia, it became obsolete in the Middle Ages and was replaced by duke (\\"hertig\\"/\\"hertug\\"/\\"hertog\\"). In later medieval Britain, it became the equivalent of the continental count (in England in the earlier period, it was more akin to a duke; in Scotland it assimilated the concept of mormaer). However, earlier in Scandinavia, \\"jarl\\" could also mean a sovereign prince. For example, the rulers of several of the petty kingdoms of Norway had the title of \\"jarl\\" and in many cases they had no less power than their neighbours who had the title of king. Alternative names for the \\"Earl/Count\\" rank in the nobility structure are used in other countries, such as Hakushaku during the Japanese Imperial era.  - The Canadian titles debate has been ongoing since the presentation to the Canadian House of Commons of the Nickle Resolution in 1917. This resolution marked the earliest attempt to establish a Canadian government policy requesting the sovereign not to grant knighthoods, baronetcies, and peerages to Canadians and set the precedent for later policies restricting Canadians from accepting titles from foreign countries. Dissatisfaction with the British honours system led to the gradual creation of a separate system for Canada.  - A global city, also called world city or sometimes alpha city or world center, is a city generally considered to be an important node in the global economic system. The concept comes from geography and urban studies, and the idea that globalization can be understood as largely created, facilitated, and enacted in strategic geographic locales according to a hierarchy of importance to the operation of the global system of finance and trade.  - Ontario, one of the 13 provinces and territories of Canada, is located in east-central Canada. It is Canada's most populous province by a large margin, accounting for nearly 40 percent of all Canadians, and is the second-largest province in total area. Ontario is fourth-largest in total area when the territories of the Northwest Territories and Nunavut are included. It is home to the nation's capital city, Ottawa, and the nation's most populous city, Toronto.  - The Greater Toronto Area (GTA) is the most populous metropolitan area in Canada. At the 2011 census, it had a population of 6,054,191, and the census metropolitan area had a population of 5,583,064. The Greater Toronto Area is defined as the central city of Toronto, and the four regional municipalities that surround it: Durham, Halton, Peel, and York. The regional span of the Greater Toronto Area is sometimes combined with the city of Hamilton, Ontario and its surrounding region, to form the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area. The Greater Toronto Area is the northern part of the Golden Horseshoe.  - A baronet (or ; abbreviated Bart or Bt) or the rare female equivalent, a baronetess (, or ; abbreviation \\"Btss\\"), is the holder of a baronetcy, a hereditary title awarded by the British Crown. The practice of awarding baronetcies was originally introduced in England in the 14th century and was used by James I of England in 1611 as a means of raising funds.  - Chicago (or ), officially the City of Chicago, is the third-most populous city in the United States, and the fifth-most populous city in North America. With over 2.7 million residents, it is the most populous city in the state of Illinois and the Midwestern United States, and the county seat of Cook County. The Chicago metropolitan area, often referred to as Chicagoland, has nearly 10 million people and is the third-largest in the U.S.  - A knight is a person granted an honorary title of \\"knighthood\\" by a monarch or other political leader for service to the monarch or country, especially in a military capacity. Historically, in Europe, knighthood was conferred upon mounted warriors. During the High Middle Ages, knighthood was considered a class of lower nobility. By the Late Middle Ages, the rank had become associated with the ideals of chivalry, a code of conduct for the perfect courtly Christian warrior. Often, a knight was a vassal who served as a fighter for a lord, with payment in the form of land holdings. The lords trusted the knights, who were skilled in battle on horseback. Since the early modern period, the title of knight is purely honorific, usually bestowed by a monarch, as in the British honours system, often for non-military service to the country. The modern female equivalent in the United Kingdom is Dame.  - The Stanley Cup is the championship trophy awarded annually to the National Hockey League (NHL) playoff winner. Originally commissioned in 1892 as the \\"Dominion Hockey Challenge Cup\\", the trophy is named for Lord Stanley of Preston, thenGovernor General of Canada, who awarded it to Canada's top-ranking amateur ice hockey club, which the entire Stanley family supported, with the sons and daughters playing and promoting the game. The first Cup was awarded in 1893 to Montreal HC, and subsequent winners from 1893 to 1914 were determined by challenge games and league play. Professional teams first became eligible to challenge for the Stanley Cup in 1906. In 1915, the two professional ice hockey organizations, the National Hockey Association (NHA) and the Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA), reached a gentlemen's agreement in which their respective champions would face each other annually for the Stanley Cup. After a series of league mergers and folds, it was established as the \\"de facto\\" championship trophy of the NHL in 1926 and then the \\"de jure\\" NHL championship prize in 1947.  - The National Hockey Association (NHA), officially the \\"National Hockey Association of Canada Limited\\", was a professional ice hockey organization with teams in Ontario and Quebec, Canada. It is the direct predecessor to today's National Hockey League (NHL). Founded in 1909 by Ambrose O'Brien, the NHA introduced 'six-man hockey' by removing the 'rover' position in 1911. During its lifetime, the league coped with competition for players with the rival Pacific Coast Hockey Association (PCHA), the enlistment of players for World War I and disagreements between owners. The disagreements between owners came to a head in 1917, when the NHA suspended operations in order to get rid of an unwanted owner (Eddie Livingstone). The remaining NHA team owners started the NHL in parallel as a temporary measure, to continue play while negotiations went on with Livingstone and other lawsuits were pending. A year later, after no progress was reached with Livingstone, the other NHA owners decided to permanently suspend the NHA. The NHA's rules, constitution and trophies were continued in the NHL.  - Los Angeles (Spanish for \\"The Angels\\"), officially the City of Los Angeles and often known by its initials L.A., is the second-most populous city in the United States (after New York City), the most populous city in California and the county seat of Los Angeles County. Situated in Southern California, Los Angeles is known for its mediterranean climate, ethnic diversity, sprawling metropolis, and as a major center of the American entertainment industry. Los Angeles lies in a large coastal basin surrounded on three sides by mountains reaching up to and over .  - The City of New York, often called New York City or simply New York, is the most populous city in the United States. With an estimated 2015 population of 8,550,405 distributed over a land area of just , New York City is also the most densely populated major city in the United States. Located at the southern tip of the state of New York, the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area, one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world. A global power city, New York City exerts a significant impact upon commerce, finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education, and entertainment, its fast pace defining the term \\"New York minute\\". Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an important center for international diplomacy and has been described as the cultural and financial capital of the world.  - John Ambrose O'Brien (May 27, 1885  April 25, 1968), was an industrialist and sports team owner. He was a founder of the National Hockey Association (NHA), owner of the Renfrew Millionaires and the founding owner of the Montreal Canadiens professional ice hockey team.  - Quebec (pronounced or ) is the second-most populous province of Canada and the only one to have a predominantly French-speaking population, with French as the sole provincial official language.  - Toronto is the most populous city in Canada, the provincial capital of Ontario, and the centre of the Greater Toronto Area, the most populous metropolitan area in Canada. Growing in population, the 2011 census recorded a population of 2,615,060. As of 2015, the population is now estimated at 2,826,498, making Toronto the fourth-largest city in North America based on the population within its city limits. Toronto trails only Mexico City, New York City, and Los Angeles by this measure, while it is the fifth-largest (behind also Chicago) if ranked by the size of its metropolitan area . An established global city, Toronto is an international centre of business, finance, arts, and culture, and widely recognized as one of the most multicultural and cosmopolitan cities in the world.  - Ice hockey is a contact team sport played on ice, usually in a rink, in which two teams of skaters use their sticks to shoot a vulcanized rubber puck into their opponent's net to score points. Ice hockey teams usually consist of six players each: one goaltender, and five players who skate up and down the ice trying to take the puck and score a goal against the opposing team.  - The major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada are the highest professional competitions of team sports in the United States and Canada. The four leagues universally included in the definition are Major League Baseball (MLB), the National Basketball Association (NBA), the National Football League (NFL), and the National Hockey League (NHL). Other prominent leagues include Major League Soccer (MLS) and the Canadian Football League (CFL).  - The Toronto Hockey Club, known as the Torontos and the Toronto Blueshirts were a professional ice hockey team based in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. They were a member of the National Hockey Association (NHA). The club was founded in 1911 and began operations in 1912.

Please answer the following question: Called the PURE (Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiology) study, this was a very large observational study looking at the link between fat and carbohydrate consumption and longevity in 18 countries across 5 continents. Running for 7 years and involving over 135,000 people, this was a very big study so its conclusions are right to take notice of. The key finding from the work that attracted the most media attention was that a high carbohydrate diet was linked with a higher risk of earlier mortality, whereas total fat and individual types of fat were related to a lower risk of earlier mortality. Digging deeper into the study, the research team found that global diets consisted of 61 percent energy coming from carbohydrates and 24 percent energy from fats. And while those in the highest carbohydrate consumption group (a whopping 77 percent of energy) had a higher risk of earlier death, it wasn’t cardiovascular disease they were dying from. What those other causes of death were exactly is unclear. Perhaps getting hit by a car running for a Mars Bar was one of them as a recent commenter on my Facebook page theorised. A paradigm shift? Not quite Does this study turn on its head ‘everything we knew about nutrition?’ Not quite. And here’s why. Before the PURE study, there were many studies showing the opposite link between carbohydrates and longevity. So, when a conflicting study comes along, this grabs the media spotlight for the day. Here is just one example – a major systematic review and meta-analysis from 2013 involving 17 individual studies and over 242,000 people showing a higher risk of earlier mortality as carbohydrate intake decreased. And this is the problem at times with observational research in that two studies can give polar opposite results so the findings of the PURE study should be seen through this filter.

The hypothesis, \\"The women go and have lunch and then come back to finish the painting,\\" suggests that the women take a break from the painting for lunch, presumably to eat and possibly socialize, and then return to complete the painting afterwards. While the hypothesis presents a potential scenario that may or may not be inspired by the premise, the premise itself does not provide any evidence or details to support or refute the hypothesis. We are not given any information about the time, circumstances, or context of the lunch or the completion of the painting, so it is impossible to determine if this specific hypothesis aligns with the given premise. In other words, the premise does not tell us whether the hypothesis is true or not, since the focus of the premise is on the woman painting the girl's face, not on their actions outside of this specific activity. If additional information were provided about the woman, the blond girl, and their context, it might be possible to form a more definitive answer about the hypothesis's truthfulness. For example, if we knew that the woman and the girl had a set schedule including lunch breaks and planned pauses in their activities, we would have more evidence to assess the hypothesis. However, based on the provided premise alone, we do not have enough information to determine whether the hypothesis is true or false."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It is important to analyze the information given and break it down to better understand the situation. Firstly, we were informed about a conversation with ethics counselor Howard Wilson on January 30, discussing the minister's involvement with the legislation. The legislation in question is presumably related to pension regulations. Secondly, we learned that the Canada Steamship Line (CSL) has a pension fund incorporated under the Pension Fund Societies Act. This means that there is a steamship line in Canada – the Canada Steamship Line. This information alone disproves the conclusion \\"Canada has no steamship line.\\" Further, we were informed that the CSL's pension fund operates under the Department of Industry and will not be directly affected by the Pension Benefit Standards Act. This information shows that the CSL is a legitimate entity in Canada. However, this information does not necessarily provide insights into the overall state of the steamship industry in Canada or how many steamship lines there are in the country. It does, however, tell us that the Canada Steamship Line exists and has a pension fund regulated by the Department of Industry. In conclusion, based on the information provided, it would be inaccurate to assert that Canada has no steamship line.

Please briefly summarize this news article: The best way to honor slain schoolchildren (Opinion) Editor's note: Donna Brazile, a CNN contributor and a Democratic strategist, is vice chairwoman for voter registration and participation at the Democratic National Committee. A nationally syndicated columnist, she is an adjunct professor at Georgetown University and author of \\"Cooking With Grease: Stirring the Pots in America.\\" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. (CNN) -- When I saw these words on Twitter, I couldn't help but put down my tablet: \\"They say the smallest coffins are the heaviest to carry.\\" They weigh heaviest upon the heart. First the Sydney attack Monday, then all too soon there came the school killings Tuesday -- 145 people, 132 of them children -- in Peshawar, Pakistan. Tragedies are stacking up. There isn't enough time to grieve. To spend one minute of silence in honor of each of the lives lost would take more than two hours. The average life expectancy for men in Pakistan is about 66 years. These children killed at their school had some 50 years of life stolen from them — life that will never be lived. Think back on the last year. What did you accomplish? How many times did you laugh? How many act of kindness did you bring into the world? Think on all you did. Think of what could have been if these children had lived — of how each of their lives could have changed the world. It takes but one person, one moment, one conviction, to start a ripple of change. Because they can't, we must. Those stolen lifetimes deserve fulfillment. Those children's lives can still change the world. But it requires us to be called from despair to action. Although their deaths are senseless and tragic, their potential lives can unfold through us. The smallest coffins are the heaviest, but living for the child lightens our hearts. It is easy to fall into despair thinking about all that is wrong with the world. The joys seems so small in comparison. Internet videos of cats riding Roombas just can't compete with a father talking about how his dead 13-year-old son had wanted to be a pilot. How do we not yield to despair? Action is my antidote. I do something. The Taliban attacked a school -- and earlier had shot Malala, an education activist -- because they are scared. They fear the potential of education to change the world, and move beyond them. Education is the light that fights their darkness. It is up to us. The horror of their methods only redoubles our commitment to spreading the light. We know education is a human right and an unstoppable force. We can use our grief to activate and motivate us, to work so even more children are educated, to ensure that these child killings are the last throes of the Taliban's reign of terror. Not long after the devastating news of the attack, I began to see a growing online community, started in large party by people of Pakistani descent across the world, looking for ways to help those in need in. Each is seeking ways to honor those murdered in Peshawar. You don't have to donate. But at the very least, you can add your name to online pledges and join this community in saying, \\"Your terror only makes us fight harder.\\" If you want your checkbook to follow your heart, make a donation to those doing work you support. The Malala Fund is a great place to start. UNICEF and the Global Fund for Children are other established, well-respected organizations that do great work across the world for children. If you aren't in a positon to give money, get some skin in the game. In 2015, the Hult Prize challenge will provide quality education for 10 million children who live in urban slums. If you are a student whose school is involved, apply online before December 21. Apply for a chance at 1 million to change the lives of 10 million children, and through them, to help change the world. If your school is not involved, apply here. If you are not a student, you can connect with your local university and offer to support the team working for early childhood education in urban slums. You have something to offer — maybe you bake fantastic cookies, or provide expertise in financial modeling, or simply ask good questions.

Roger McGuinn), and David Crosby and first released as a single on March 14, 1966 (see 1966 in music). Musically influenced by Ravi Shankar and John Coltrane, \\"Eight Miles High\\", along with its McGuinn and Crosby-penned B-side \\"Why\\", was influential in developing the musical styles of psychedelic rock, raga rock, and psychedelic pop. Accordingly, critics often cite \\"Eight Miles High\\" as being the first bona fide psychedelic rock song, as well as a classic of the counterculture era. The song was subject to a U.S. radio ban shortly after its release, following allegations published in the broadcasting trade journal the Gavin Report regarding perceived drug connotations in its lyrics. Context: The master recording of \\"Eight Miles High\\" was recorded on January 24 and 25, 1966, at Columbia Studios in Hollywood, with record producer Allen Stanton guiding the band through the recording process. John Einarson has noted that the influence of Coltrane's saxophone playing and, in particular, his song \\"India\\" from the Impressions album, can be clearly heard in \\"Eight Miles High\\"--most noticeably in McGuinn's recurring twelve-string guitar solo. In addition to this striking guitar motif, the song is also highlighted by Chris Hillman's driving and hypnotic bass line, Crosby's chunky rhythm guitar playing and the band's ethereal harmonies.  \\"Eight Miles High\\" also exhibits the influence of sitarist Ravi Shankar, particularly in the droning quality of the song's vocal melody and in McGuinn's guitar playing. However, the song does not actually feature the sound of the sitar, despite the Byrds having appeared brandishing the instrument at a contemporary press conference held to promote the single. In a 1966 promotional interview, which was added to the expanded CD reissue of the Fifth Dimension album, Crosby said that the song's ending made him \\"feel like a plane landing.\\"  An earlier version of \\"Eight Miles High\\" was recorded with Al Schmitt at RCA Studios in Los Angeles on December 22, 1965, but Columbia Records refused to release that recording because it had not been produced at a Columbia-owned studio. McGuinn has since stated that he believes this original version of the song to be more spontaneous sounding than the better known Columbia release. That opinion was echoed by Crosby, who commented, \\"It was a stunner, it was better, it was stronger. It had more flow to it. It was the way we wanted it to be.\\" This original version of \\"Eight Miles High\\" initially saw release on the 1987 archival album Never Before and was also included as a bonus track on the 1996 Columbia/Legacy CD reissue of Fifth Dimension. Question: Do all of the band members prefer the original version? Answer:","output":"While it is not explicitly documented whether all band members of the Byrds prefer the original version of \\"Eight Miles High,\\" it is evident that both Jim McGuinn (a.k.a. Roger McGuinn) and David Crosby have expressed their preference for it. McGuinn has stated that he believes the original version is more spontaneous sounding than the Columbia release, and Crosby has shared a similar sentiment, stating that the original version was \\"better\\" and \\"stronger\\" with more flow to it, and that it was how they wanted it to be. However, there is no information available about the opinions of the other band members, namely Gene Clark, Michael Clarke, and Chris Hillman, on this matter. It is important to note that opinions and preferences around music can differ greatly, even within a band. Therefore, without clear statements from all the band members, we cannot definitively conclude that all of them prefer the original version of \\"Eight Miles High.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

However, the drippings from fruits, vegetables, and meats can drip into the fan and become difficult to clean.; [-] Horizontal dehydrators will still work with a wide variety of foods. It is important that you get one that can run indefinitely up to 40 , 000 psi.;","output":"Vertical dehydrators with a fan on the bottom provide the best heat distribution and are more efficient because hot air rises. However, the drippings from fruits, vegetables, and meats can drip into the fan and become difficult to clean. When choosing a vertical dehydrator, consider ones with a bottom fan and be prepared for extra cleaning if you are dehydrating foods that may produce drippings. If you are dehydrating a variety of foods, look for models with adjustable trays. This allows you to organize your foods by type and by how much drying they require, giving you more control over the dehydration process. For instance, fruits like apples and bananas may take less time to dehydrate compared to meats or thicker vegetables. Therefore, being able to adjust your trays accordingly can ensure that all your foods are perfectly dehydrated. One additional tip when using a vertical dehydrator is to rotate your trays regularly. Because of the heat distribution, trays closer to the heat source will dehydrate faster. By rotating your trays, you can ensure uniform drying for all your foods. Bear in mind that dehydrating foods is a slow process. Depending on the type of food and the heat setting, it may take several hours or even days for your food to be fully dehydrated. Patience is key when using a dehydrator. Also, endeavor to store your dehydrated foods properly to maintain their quality and extend their shelf life. In summary, a vertical dehydrator can be a valuable tool for anyone looking to preserve their food through dehydration. It's a cost-effective and convenient choice, especially for individuals with limited kitchen space. Though it may require a bit more maintenance due to potential drippings in the fan system, the versatility and efficiency of these machines may make them an ideal choice for many home cooks. Nevertheless, ensure you weigh all these aspects before deciding on the right model for your dehydration needs."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I have a new situation: Bobby and Kenny are two prolific farmers from Arkansas who have ponds located down stream from their farm sites. Bobby recently received a large order of potatoes from a neighboring city. Because of this order, Bobby has dramatically increased the amount of fertilizer he is using on his farm. Kenny mainly grows tomatoes, which are not in season right now, so his use of fertilizer is currently low. Over the past month there has been a large amount of rain falling on both Bobby and Kenny's farms.  But I can use this background: Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil. Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf.  What is an answer for this question: Who will cause less fertilizer to end up in the ponds near their farm? Answer:","output":"Given the situation and background information provided, Kenny will cause less fertilizer to end up in the ponds near their farm. This is because Kenny is currently growing tomatoes, which are not in season, and as a result, his use of fertilizer is low. On the other hand, Bobby has received a large order of potatoes and has significantly increased the amount of fertilizer he uses on his farm. Since rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil and runoff carries it away into bodies of water like ponds, the higher usage of fertilizer by Bobby will more likely contribute to a higher amount of fertilizer ending up in the ponds near his farm, compared to Kenny's lower usage of fertilizer."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This challenge highlights the ongoing political and cultural tensions between the two major political factions in Northern Ireland. In this article, we will delve into the underlying reasons for the name change proposal, the arguments posed by both sides, and the potential implications of this dispute on Northern Ireland's political landscape. Background and Context: The city of Londonderry, also commonly referred to as Derry, has a long and complicated history, with its name signifying a focal point of division between Nationalists, who primarily identify as Irish and Catholic, and Unionists, who predominantly identify as British and Protestant. Nationalists argue that the original name of the city is Derry and that the term \\"London\\" was added during the 17th-century colonization efforts by the British to strengthen ties to London. Consequently, Nationalists prefer the name Derry, whereas Unionists favor Londonderry. Sinn Féin's Name Change Proposal: Sinn Féin, a Nationalist political party in both Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, has put forth a proposal to officially rename Londonderry as Derry. Their argument primarily revolves around historical accuracy and the honoring of the city's Irish heritage. Additionally, Sinn Féin and other Nationalists assert that the name Londonderry serves as a reminder of British colonization and oppression. Unionist Politicians' Challenge: In response to Sinn Féin's proposal, Unionist politicians have filed an official challenge, maintaining that the name Londonderry holds significant meaning for the Unionist community and that changing it would exacerbate divisions. Unionist representatives argue that such a change would undermine the political stability established by the Good Friday Agreement of 1998, which aimed to promote peace, reconciliation, and mutual respect between the two communities. Potential Implications of the Name Change Dispute: The dispute over the city's name reflects deeper political and cultural divisions within Northern Ireland, involving issues of identity, heritage, and political allegiances. An official renaming could potentially reignite simmering tensions between Nationalists and Unionists, while leaving the matter unresolved might continue to fuel debate and discontent. Looking forward, the challenge submitted by Unionist politicians may prompt further discussions and negotiation between the two factions. Achieving a mutually acceptable resolution is crucial for maintaining peace and facilitating collaboration between the Nationalist and Unionist communities. Conclusion: The official challenge filed by Unionist politicians against Sinn Féin's proposal to rename Londonderry as Derry underscores the ongoing struggle for identity and recognition in Northern Ireland. While the name change proposal seeks to honor the city's Irish roots, Unionists view it as a potential disruption to the fragile peace established by the Good Friday Agreement. It remains to be seen whether a compromise can be reached that allows both communities to feel respected and acknowledged in their shared history and future."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Second question: \\"Why is a ship is called 'she' in English?\\" Are these two questions asking the same thing?","output":"No, these two questions are not asking the same thing. They address different aspects of ships and boats.  First question: What's the difference between a ship and a boat? The primary differences between a ship and a boat lie in their size, function, and construction. 1. Size: Ships are generally larger than boats. A ship is defined as a large watercraft that is capable of deep-sea navigation and extensive voyages across oceans. They have a greater tonnage capacity, spacious cargo rooms, and a deeper draft. Boats, on the other hand, are smaller watercraft that are specialized for rivers, lakes, and coastal waters. They have a shallower draft, making them suitable for navigating smaller bodies of water. 2. Function: Ships are designed for long-distance travel, carrying cargo and/or passengers across vast stretches of open water. They are equipped with advanced navigation and communication systems, multiple watertight compartments, and complex propulsion systems. Boats, conversely, are used for a variety of purposes like fishing, sports, leisure, and short-distance transportation. Boats generally have less complex systems and are easier to operate. 3. Construction: Ships are constructed using high-quality materials for increased durability and resistance to harsh weather conditions. The construction of ships requires extensive planning, expertise, and well-established shipyards to develop these massive watercraft. Boats, in contrast, can be manufactured at a smaller facility and have a simpler construction that is typically less expensive than that of ships. 4. Crew: Ships have a larger crew compared to boats. Crew members on a ship have specific roles and responsibilities, such as navigation, engineering, and vessel management. Boats typically have a smaller crew and, in many cases, can be operated by a single person. Second question: \\"Why is a ship is called 'she' in English?\\" Referring to a ship as \\"she\\" is a historical convention in the English language, which has roots in tradition, anthropomorphism, and linguistics. 1. Tradition: Maritime tradition played a significant role in how ships were personified in the past. Ships were considered a form of protection and sustenance for sailors who spent months at sea. Sailors formed a deep attachment to their vessels, and ascribing a female gender to ships was a way to express that bond. Using \\"she\\" for the ship's pronoun is similar to how some people might refer to their cars as \\"she\\" today. This personification dates back centuries and cuts across many languages and cultures. 2. Anthropomorphism: Another reason is due to the personification of ships, where they are given human-like qualities to illustrate their nature. Ships, much like people, were believed to have personalities, and so they were given names and considered a part of the crew. Anthropomorphism was a way for people to understand and make sense of the world around them and create an emotional connection to an inanimate object. 3. Linguistics: Historically, some languages had different gender systems for nouns where objects were assigned a gender, either masculine or feminine. In Old English, gendered nouns existed, and many words associated with ships were feminine. Over time, as the English language simplified its grammatical gender, the tradition of referring to ships as female persisted. It is important to note that in recent years, more people choose to use gender-neutral terminology when referring to objects, including ships. This change addresses concerns about gender equality and linguistic accuracy. However, the custom of calling a ship \\"she\\" still endures in some maritime communities."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Raphael: nothing wrong about it, there are always some unexperienced people at sea Carlos: sure, you should learn somehow, right?

Carlos: Maybe close to the Balearic Islands? Raphael: or Greece Carlos: could be good as well Faith: Carols wants to be close to home, right? Carlos: a bit, but I love Greece as well, so no pressure What was going on in that conversation?","output":"In the conversation, Raphael, Faith, and Carlos are discussing plans for a sailing trip in the summer. Raphael and Carlos are experienced in sailing and propose the idea of going for a sail. Faith initially expresses reservations due to her lack of experience, but Raphael and Carlos assure her that it's alright and she can learn. They reassure Faith that they plan to sail in a calm Mediterranean area, as opposed to the more demanding Southern Seas. This decision helps assuage Faith's apprehension, making her more excited about the trip. Then, the discussion moves towards deciding a specific location within the Mediterranean for their sailing trip. They consider both the Balearic Islands and Greece as potential destinations. Faith notices Carlos' preference to stay close to home (perhaps identified by his initial suggestion of the Balearic Islands). However, Carlos clarifies that he has no strong bias, stating he loves Greece too, indicating that he doesn't feel the pressure to choose one location over the other. Therefore, the conversation is about planning a summer sailing trip within a safe, beginner-friendly environment, while trying to decide on the specific location. Justifying these steps: 1) Understanding the User's Query: The user asked what was going on in the conversation. Hence, the task is clear - I need to summarise and describe the conversation as accurately as possible. 2) Analyzing the Conversation: The conversation needed to be broken down into smaller parts in order to analyze it effectively. This helped me understand the dynamics at play and the emotions of the people involved. 3) Translating Analysis into a Summary: Once the analysis was complete, the next step was to compose a summary.

After reading other reviews of this place, I decided to check it out after work with Jason O. for a healthy and fresh Japanese dinner. I am disappointed to report that Wasabi offered sub-par sushi and even worse cooked items.   My judgement of a sushi restaurant's quality of sushi comes in the tasting of two different types of nigiri. The first always being tamago as it is the piece with the lowest payoff for a sushi restaurant (if they take pride in their sushi, they will do the tamago correctly). The second is going to be a well textured, but very delicate cut of fish (on this day it was halibut). The tamago was presented fallen over and was overly sweet with a \\"frozen\\" taste to it. The halibut was not even prepared correctly, there was no grated yuzu (I may be asking for too much at this point) and no salt on the on the fish (you do not use soy sauce for a fish like halibut). The fish itself did not have a clean flavor and an off-putting texture. Finally, the most unforgiving of sins against sushi that Wasabi commits is their packing of sushi. Sushi rice is not to be packed so tight as you are supposed to dip the sushi FISH SIDE DOWN. I am sorry to say that grocery store sushi is better than the offerings here.   We then had the calamari appetizer. I don't even know where to begin here. Calamari should not be like onion rings (in other words, the batter should not fall off of the squid like an onion ring. Utterly disappointing.   Finally, we ended with the unagi dinner. The fillets of eel were obviously pre-frozen/pre-cooked, drenched in eel sauce, served atop a bed of rice that could feed a family of five, and also contained bones. The side to this dish was not the usual fresh or pickled vegetables that one would find traditionally used to cut the richness of properly prepared unagi, but was instead limp and bitter sauteed cabbage.  All in all, this was a very disappointing meal and I would be embarrassed to serve this food and call it \\"Japanese.\\" I rarely ever give out 1 star, but usually 1-star reviews go to venues that have rats and cockroaches.

The answer to the question: What college presents a symmetrical front to New Road? is inside the article: The college presents a symmetrical front to New Road and the castle mound, with four small gables between a larger gable at either end. There are two quadrangles, with steps leading down from the upper quadrangle (to the east) to the lower quadrangle (to the west). Residential accommodation for students and fellows is located in the lower quadrangle, whilst the hall, library, and administrative offices are in the upper quadrangle. The buildings are two storeys high, with dormers above. There are pools in the centre of the quadrangles (the one in the lower quadrangle is the longer of the two); the writer Simon Jenkins said that these are \\"almost puddles\\", and saw them as relics of Harrison's Mediterranean plan. The writer Peter Sager, however, thought that the pond represents the canal basin that previously occupied the site. The main entrance leads into the upper quadrangle, which has the hall on its east side. The square-mullioned windows facing the quadrangles are arranged in close-set groups of three; at the east end of the upper quadrangle, the common room has a larger bay window. An abstract sculpture by Hubert Dalwood, from 1962, has been positioned on the lawn inside the college. Dalwood also designed the fountain in the pool in the upper quadrangle, although his plan for a spray of water was not implemented, \\"leaving the sculpture with no obvious purpose\\". The hall has a floor of black and white marble and arches made of concrete supporting an oak roof with red panels. The furniture in the hall was designed by, and the chairs were built by, Edward Barnsley. Lord Nuffield's coat of arms are displayed over the fireplace, carved from a single piece of stone, and his portrait, painted by Sir Arthur Cope, hangs in the hall. The chapel, on the south side of the college, can seat forty people. It has five abstract stained glass windows that were designed by John Piper and executed by Patrick Reyntiens, and a metal reredos with a bronze crucifix.

Joel Morales, 12, committed suicide after a two-year barrage of bullying because of his small stature, according to his family.      Now the boy’s family from East Harlem, New York have filed a law suit against the city, the Board of Education and four youths.      His mother, Lisbeth Babilonia, said the bullies hassled Joel every day, throwing pencils and taunting him.      In the suit, Joel was described as ‘a small-framed, fragile boy who sometimes stuttered and had problems with fine motor skills. He was extremely short and underweight for his age’.            He also suffered from unspecified anxiety disorders according to the Daily News .      The allegedly bullies were named as Kenneth, Stephen, Omar and Elijah ‘Doe’ and their parents were named as defendants.      The schoolboy was ‘the target of ongoing severe, brutal physical and emotional abuse and harassment’ by his peers at Public School 102 in East Harlem, according to the suit.      Ms Babilonia complained to the Board of Education several times and eventually the school set up a meeting with the perpetrators’ parents.            After the meeting, the boys allegedly went to the apartment block where Joel lived and threw pipes and sticks at him.      Ms Babilonia’s lawyer Tedd Kessler said of the meeting: ‘It didn’t alleviate the situation at all.’      Joel was transferred to nearby Public School 57 but the bullies followed him after school.      The boy was found dead in his family’s apartment on May 31 last year.      Ms Babilonia was left bewildered by his actions. She said: ‘Every morning he always said “I love you mum. Give me a hug and a kiss.”’      At the time of Joel’s death, it was revealed that his father had committed suicide some 13 years ago when he jumped off a rooftop in New York's Bronx borough.      A 'beautiful boy': Joel suffered physical and emotional abuse, and while his mother complained to the Board of Education it did little to alleviate the situation      Neighbours told how Ms Babilonia let out a 'blood-curdling scream' as she cut down her son's body with a knife before plunging the blade into herself.      Neighbour Inez Rodriguez, 41, said that he knocked the knife out of Ms Babilonia’s hand as she tried to harm herself. He also tried to give Joel CPR.            Relatives said the boy was teased for being short and brainy but the final tipping point were taunts about his dead father. Joel was 4-months-old when his father died.            Richard Salazar, 25, Babilonia's other son said to the New York Post last year: 'She’s going through the same thing she went through then.'      The boy's aunt Angelica Babilonia, 23, said he told a friend just hours before taking his life: 'I’m tired of all this bullying.'            In April this year, Rehtaeh Parsons from Nova Scotia, Canada hanged herself after four boys raped her and spread a photograph of the assault, causing classmates and friends to taunt and cyber-bully her, her mother has said.      Driven from school: Joel was taunted by classmates at Public School 102 (pictured) in East Harlem, New York before his family transferred him to nearby Public School 57 but the bullies followed him after school      Joel's mother Lisbeth Babilonia revealed he always said: 'I love you mum.

Joel transferred schools, his mother Lizbeth Babilonia contacted the police, and she tried to get her and her son transferred to another housing project. But still, Joel took his own life on May 29, 2012. Now, Babilonia is suing the city, the Board of Education, and the individual bullies who tormented Joel, as well as their parents. The suit claims Babilonia \\"complained multiple times per week to Department of Education personnel,\\" but the bullies were not disciplined. ||||| Summary:","output":"The family of a 12-year-old boy, Joel Morales, who committed suicide after being bullied for two years, is suing the city, the Board of Education, and the four alleged bullies.

Please answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: An apex predator, also known as an alpha predator or top predator, is a predator at the top of a food chain, with no natural predators.Apex predators are usually defined in terms of trophic dynamics, meaning that they occupy the highest trophic levels. Food chains are often far shorter on land, usually limited to being secondary consumers – for example, wolves prey mostly upon large herbivores (primary consumers), which eat plants (primary producers). The apex predator concept is applied in wildlife management, conservation and ecotourism.  I am facing a new situation today: Two cousins were fascinated about food chains in nature. Liam started reading about apex predators, while Fox read about grazers and large herbivores.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which cousin learned more about predators with no natural predators? Answer:","output":"Based on the background information provided, Liam, who read about apex predators, learned more about predators with no natural predators. This is because apex predators, also known as alpha predators or top predators, are the ones that sit at the top of the food chain and have no natural predators. These apex predators play a critical role in maintaining the balance and overall health of an ecosystem. On the other hand, Fox read about grazers and large herbivores. Grazers and large herbivores are primary consumers, meaning they consume primary producers such as plants to obtain their energy and nutrients. While these animals play an essential role in their respective ecosystems and can be prey for predators, they are not the top of the food chain like apex predators. In summary, Liam's focus on apex predators provided him with knowledge specifically about predators with no natural predators, while Fox's focus on grazers and large herbivores covered animals lower in the food chain, which are often hunted by predators, but are not themselves apex predators. Therefore, Liam learned more about predators with no natural predators in this situation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Title: Zero-Gravity Wreaks Chaos on Long Hair During Televised Presidential Call Subtitle: An Unintended Celestial Consequence of Long Hair as President Obama Makes a Historical Call to Space In a rather peculiar and comical event, zero-gravity seemed to challenge the traditional norms of grooming during an important televised phone call made by President Obama. As humanity pushes the boundaries of space exploration and frequently conducts astronauts' interactions with the Earth, we get to witness not only the exciting developments of science and technology but also the unforeseen and humorous effects of the space environment on human life. President Obama's call was meant to highlight and appreciate the astronauts' contributions towards significantly advancing our understanding of space, reflecting the administration's commitment to inspiring future generations for more daring space excursions. While the entire event was groundbreaking and showed incredible cooperation between the White House and space agencies, it had an unexpected twist that sent a wave of laughter across viewers and participants alike. Long hair, a simple and common trait among billions of people on Earth, proved to be a playful contender in space. As the astronauts conversed with the president, their long hair floated in every conceivable direction, defying both gravity and their attempts to maintain a composed appearance. Remarkably, even during this serious and formal communication, the zero-gravity environment provided moments of lighthearted entertainment that reminded us of the many unique challenges faced by astronauts in their daily lives. This incident brings forth an interesting aspect of human adaptability and resilience, albeit in a humorous light. The astronauts, despite the floating hair and distractions, maintained their professionalism and dedication to their mission, responding thoughtfully to the president's questions and providing insightful details of their experiences and discoveries. In the meantime, President Obama himself seemed to take the situation in stride, acknowledging the astronauts' endeavors with a contagious sense of humor. The hair-raising rendezvous also demonstrated that space exploration comes with its fair share of surprises. It is not just the cosmic events or the breathtaking imagery that interest researchers and space enthusiasts, but also the day-to-day challenges that contribute to the collective human experience in space. From eating and sleeping to exercising and personal grooming, astronauts are constantly adapting and learning how to navigate life in an out-of-this-world environment. This televised phone call has not only garnered attention for the astronauts' impressive achievements but also provided a valuable lesson: to embrace humor and adaptability in even the most professional and high-stakes situations. The unfaltering grace and poise exhibited by the astronauts, despite their uncooperative locks, have not only humanized space activities but also serves as an inspiration for aspiring young astronauts, showcasing the lighter side of this demanding profession. In conclusion, the zero-gravity long-haired debacle during President Obama's call to space has immortalized itself as a symbol of the challenges that come hand-in-hand with the enormity of space exploration—and the human ability to rise above them. The global community will undoubtedly maintain this conversation about the vastness of the cosmos, as we continue expanding the horizons of our knowledge, conquering new frontiers and, occasionally, tending to the mischief of unruly hair in space."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer this question: which category of food provides the most riboflavin?","output":"Riboflavin, also known as vitamin B2, is an essential nutrient required for various bodily functions including energy production, normal cell growth and function, and maintaining overall good health. It is an important water-soluble vitamin that cannot be synthesized by the human body, meaning we must obtain riboflavin from our diet to meet daily requirements. The category of food that provides the most riboflavin includes dairy products, meat, and certain plant-based foods. Let's explore these categories to see which specific foods are top sources of riboflavin: 1. Dairy products: Dairy products, particularly milk and milk-based products, are the most significant sources of riboflavin. Including these in your diet can help ensure you get enough of this essential vitamin. Key dairy sources of riboflavin include:   a. Milk (cow's milk, goat's milk)   b. Cheese (cheddar, Swiss, Gouda, Brie)   c. Yogurt (both plain and flavored)   d. Cottage cheese   e. Kefir 2. Meat and animal-based products: Aside from dairy products, several meat and animal-based foods are also rich in riboflavin. Some examples are:   a. Organ meats (liver, kidney, heart)   b. Beef (steak, ground beef)   c. Poultry (chicken, turkey)   d. Pork (tenderloin, ham)   e. Fish (salmon, trout, mackerel, tuna)   f. Eggs (both whole eggs and egg yolks) 3. Plant-based riboflavin sources: Certain plant-based foods also contain riboflavin, albeit in lower amounts compared to dairy and animal-based products. Vegetarians and vegans can obtain riboflavin from the following food sources:   a. Nuts and seeds (almonds, pistachios, sunflower seeds)   b. Leafy green vegetables (spinach, kale, collard greens)   c. Whole grains (brown rice, barley, quinoa, oats)   d. Legumes (lentils, chickpeas, and soybeans)   e. Mushrooms (shiitake, maitake, cremini, white button) Fortified foods are also a significant source of riboflavin, especially for those who consume a more restrictive diet. Many manufacturers add riboflavin to products like breakfast cereals, bread, and non-dairy milk alternatives such as almond milk and soy milk. In summary, while many food categories provide riboflavin in varying amounts, the category with the highest concentration of riboflavin is dairy products, followed by meat and animal-based products. It is important to consume a balanced diet that includes a variety of food sources to meet daily riboflavin requirements and maintain overall health."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Instead, the statement discusses the general view by the scholars, Wang, and Nyima, on how the Ming Dynasty maintained its relationship with Tibet during the reign of the Hongwu Emperor. The Hongwu Emperor, Zhu Yuanzhang, was the founder and first emperor of the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644). He officially ascended to the throne in 1368 and ruled until his death in 1398. The question of when the Hongwu Emperor used military force in Tibet pertains specifically to the period of his rule, which is not directly addressed in the statement given. During the Hongwu Emperor's reign, the relationship between the Ming Dynasty and Tibet was characterized by a system of what could be described as suzerainty, where Tibetan religious and political authorities acknowledged the Ming Dynasty's supremacy in lieu of direct military intervention from the Ming court. To strengthen and maintain the relationship with Tibetan vassal lords and their forces, the Ming court sent envoys, established tributary relations, granted titles and official positions, and frequently exchanged gifts and religious relics. This strategic approach was largely a continuation established by the previous dynasty, the Mongol-led Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368), who recognized the importance of Tibetan Buddhism and its influence in the region. The Yuan Dynasty had maintained a more direct level of control over Tibet by appointing a high-level commissioner called the \\"Sakya Dpon-chen,\\" which was established under the rule of Kublai Khan. Under the Ming Dynasty and the Hongwu Emperor's reign, the Sino-Tibetan relationship relied on maintaining close ties with Tibetan vassals, rather than resorting to direct military intervention or garrisoning troops in Tibet. As the statement highlights, scholars Wang and Nyima argue that this approach was effective in maintaining control over Tibet without the need for military force. To provide a clear-cut answer to the question, there is no direct evidence to suggest that the Hongwu Emperor used military force in Tibet during his reign from 1368 to 1398. The emperor primarily relied on political and religious ties, engaging with Tibetan vassals to maintain the influence of the Ming Dynasty in the region."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The after-action review had treated the CIA as the lead agency for any offensive against al Qaeda, and the principals, at their March 10 meeting, had endorsed strengthening the CIA's capability for that role. To the CTC, that meant proceeding with \\"The Plan,\\" which it had put forward half a year earlier-hiring and training more case officers and building up the capabilities of foreign security services that provided intelligence via liaison. On occasion, as in Jordan in December 1999, these liaison services took direct action against al Qaeda cells. In the CTC and higher up, the CIA's managers believed that they desperately needed funds just to continue their current counterterrorism effort, for they reckoned that the millennium alert had already used up all of the Center's funds for the current fiscal year; the  Bin Laden unit had spent 140 percent of its allocation. Tenet told us he met with Berger to discuss funding for counterterrorism just two days after the principals' meeting. While Clarke strongly favored giving the CIA more money for counterterrorism, he differed sharply with the CIA's managers about where it should come from. They insisted that the CIA had been shortchanged ever since the end of the Cold War. Their ability to perform any mission, counterterrorism included, they argued, depended on preserving what they had, restoring what they had lost since the beginning of the 1990s, and building from there-with across-the-board recruitment and training of new case officers, and the reopening of closed stations. To finance the counterterrorism effort, Tenet had gone to congressional leaders after the 1998 embassy bombings and persuaded them to give the CIA a special supplemental appropriation. Now, in the aftermath of the millennium alert, Tenet wanted a boost in overall funds for the CIA and another supplemental appropriation specifically for counterterrorism. To Clarke, this seemed evidence that the CIA's leadership did not give sufficient priority to the battle against  Bin Laden and al Qaeda. He told us that James Pavitt, the head of the CIA's Directorate of Operations, \\"said if there's going to be money spent on going after  Bin Laden, it should be given to him. My view was that he had had a lot of money to do it and a long time to do it, and I didn't want to put more good money after bad.\\" The CIA had a very different attitude: Pavitt told us that while the CIA's  Bin Laden unit did\\"extraordinary and commendable work,\\" his chief of station in London \\"was just as much part of the al Qaeda struggle as an officer sitting in [the  Bin Laden unit].\\" The dispute had large managerial implications, for Clarke had found Ailies in the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).

Would the following phrase be considered positive or negative? smart , compelling drama","output":"The phrase \\"smart, compelling drama\\" can be considered as positive. Let's break down the adjectives and analyze their meanings to better understand why this is a positive phrase. 1. Smart: In this context, \\"smart\\" refers to something that showcases intelligence and sophistication. When it comes to drama, a smart piece would be well-researched, thoughtfully written, and presented in a way that is engaging and insightful for the audience. The use of \\"smart\\" as an adjective suggests that the drama being described is not a run-of-the-mill or cliched offering, but rather an elevated and well-crafted piece of art. 2. Compelling: A compelling drama is one that captures the audience's attention and draws them in emotionally. It typically possesses a strong underlying theme, captivating characters, and an engaging plot that keeps the viewers invested from beginning to end. Calling a drama \\"compelling\\" means that it has the power to evoke emotions in the audience, holding their attention and even urging them to reflect on the different aspects of the narrative. When combined, \\"smart\\" and \\"compelling\\" create a powerful description that strongly implies a high-quality piece of work. In the case of a drama, it suggests a production that is intellectually stimulating and emotionally gripping, offering an experience to the audience that they would not want to miss. Therefore, the phrase \\"smart, compelling drama\\" can be deemed a positive description, as it conveys praise for the work and highlights its standout characteristics."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

By Arthur Martin PUBLISHED: 11:29 EST, 22 June 2012 | UPDATED: 06:34 EST, 23 June 2012 Bribed: Jailed Sainsbury's buyer John Maylam outside Croydon Crown Court A corrupt Sainsbury’s executive who took bribes of cash and lavish hospitality worth £5million in return for a multi-million-pound contract was jailed for four years yesterday. John Maylam, 45, who was in charge of buying potato crops for the supermarket, allowed Greenvale, a major supplier, to overcharge Sainsbury’s by £8.7million for its crop in a £40million deal. Using complex financial arrangements, he was able to artificially inflate the price without his bosses noticing. heard how Maylam and","output":"Maylam's co-conspirator, Greenvale executive David Baxter, engaged in a fraudulent scheme that lasted several years. Baxter, 50, also faced legal consequences for his involvement and was handed a 30-month prison sentence by the court. The two men had been working together since 2006, establishing a network of secret arrangements to manipulate contracts in Greenvale's favor. The court heard that Maylam enjoyed luxury holidays, expensive cars, and extravagant meals at Michelin-starred restaurants as part of the bribes received from Baxter. In addition to these personal benefits, Maylam also received significant cash payments, all of which ultimately contributed to the £5million total in bribes. Prosecutors revealed the detailed and deliberate nature of the men's scheme, exposing the lengths they went to in order to keep their illicit dealings covert. Sainsbury's, which was unaware of the arrangement between Maylam and Baxter, conducted an internal investigation upon discovering the fraud. The supermarket company subsequently ended its contract with Greenvale, citing the corrupt practices as a clear violation of its supplier code of conduct. Sainsbury's has since sought restitution for the £8.7million lost through the overcharging scheme. In passing sentence, the judge condemned the actions of both Maylam and Baxter, emphasizing the considerable financial damage caused to the company and the dishonesty at the heart of their crimes. The judge also acknowledged the personal greed that motivated the defendants and expressed hope that the sentences imposed would serve as a deterrent to others considering similar fraudulent schemes. Following the trial's conclusion, a Sainsbury's spokesperson affirmed the company's commitment to safeguarding against such corruption in the future, stating that it would continue to work diligently to maintain the highest standards of integrity in all of its business dealings."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:This article: The postwar period also saw the beginning of Bush's 20-year involvement with grand opera, a genre in which, although he achieved little commercial recognition, he was retrospectively hailed by critics as a master of British opera second only to Britten. His first venture, Wat Tyler, was  written in a form which Bush thought acceptable to the general British public; it was not his choice, he wrote, that the opera and its successors all found their initial audiences in East Germany.  When eventually staged in Britain in 1974 the opera, although well received at Sadler's Wells, seemed somewhat old-fashioned; Philip Hope-Wallace in The Guardian thought the ending degenerated into \\"a choral union cantata\\", and found the music pleasant but not especially memorable. Bush's three other major operas were all characterised by their use of \\"local\\" music: Northumbrian folk-song in the case of Men of Blackmoor, Guyanese songs and dances in The Sugar Reapers, and American folk music in Joe Hill –  the last-named used in a manner reminiscent of Kurt Weill and the German opera with which Bush had become familiar in the  early 1930s.The extent to which Bush's music  changed substantially after the war was addressed by Meirion Bowen, reviewing a Bush concert in the 1980s. Bowen noted a distinct contrast between early and late works, the former showing primarily the influences of Ireland and of Bush's European contacts, while in the later pieces the idiom was \\"often overtly folklike and Vaughan Williams-ish\\".  In general Bush's late works continued to show all the hallmarks of his postwar oeuvre: vigour, clarity of tone and  masterful use of counterpoint. The Lascaux symphony, written when he was 83, is the composer's final major orchestral statement, and addresses deep philosophical issues relating to the origins and destiny of mankind. contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person whose first venture was written in a form which Bush thought acceptable to the general British public?, what is it ?

Sir James Matthew Barrie, 1st Baronet,  (; 9 May 1860 -  19 June 1937) was a Scottish novelist and playwright, best remembered today as the creator of Peter Pan. He was born and educated in Scotland and then moved to London, where he wrote a number of successful novels and plays. James Matthew Barrie was born in Kirriemuir, Angus, to a conservative Calvinist family. His father David Barrie was a modestly successful weaver. His mother Margaret Ogilvy assumed her deceased mother's household responsibilities at the age of eight. Barrie was the ninth child of ten (two of whom died before he was born), all of whom were schooled in at least the three Rs in preparation for possible professional careers. His siblings were: Alexander (1842 - 16 July 1914), Mary Ann (1845-1918), Jane (14 March 1847 - 31 August 1895), Elizabeth (12 March 1849 - 1 April 1851), Agnes (23 Dec 1850 - 1851), David Ogilvy (30 January 1853 - 29 January 1867), Sarah (3 June 1855 -1 November 1913), Isabella (4 January 1858 - 1902) and Margaret (9 July 1863 - 1936). He was a small child and drew attention to himself with storytelling. He only grew to 5 ft 3 1/2 in. (161 cm) according to his 1934 passport.  When he was 6 years old, Barrie's next-older brother David (his mother's favourite) died the day before his 14th birthday in an ice-skating accident.This left his mother devastated, and Barrie tried to fill David's place in his mother's attentions, even wearing David's clothes and whistling in the manner that he did. One time, Barrie entered her room and heard her say, \\"Is that you?\\" \\"I thought it was the dead boy she was speaking to\\", wrote Barrie in his biographical account of his mother Margaret Ogilvy (1896) \\"and I said in a little lonely voice, 'No, it's no' him, it's just me.'\\" Barrie's mother found comfort in the fact that her dead son would remain a boy forever, never to grow up and leave her. Eventually, Barrie and his mother entertained each other with stories of her brief childhood and books such as Robinson Crusoe, works by fellow Scotsman Walter Scott, and The Pilgrim's Progress.  At the age of 8, Barrie was sent to the Glasgow Academy in the care of his eldest siblings Alexander and Mary Ann, who taught at the school. When he was 10, he returned home and continued his education at the Forfar Academy. At 14, he left home for Dumfries Academy, again under the watch of Alexander and Mary Ann. He became a voracious reader, and was fond of Penny Dreadfuls and the works of Robert Michael Ballantyne and James Fenimore Cooper. At Dumfries, he and his friends spent time in the garden of Moat Brae house, playing pirates \\"in a sort of Odyssey that was long afterwards to become the play of Peter Pan\\". They formed a drama club, producing his first play Bandelero the Bandit, which provoked a minor controversy following a scathing moral denunciation from a clergyman on the school's governing board. What happened to David?","output":"David Ogilvy Barrie, James Matthew Barrie's next-older brother, tragically died in an ice-skating accident. David was the favorite child of their mother, Margaret Ogilvy, and his death came just a day before his 14th birthday, leaving her devastated. In an attempt to fill the void left by David and to gain his mother's attention, James Barrie would wear David's clothes and imitate his mannerisms, such as whistling in the way David did. This loss had a profound effect on both James Barrie and his mother. Margaret found solace in the idea that her deceased son would remain a boy forever, never growing up and leaving her. This notion likely played a significant role in the development of Barrie's most famous creation, Peter Pan, the boy who never grows up. Throughout his life, Barrie's experiences and relationships with his family, particularly the impact of David's death and his mother's subsequent grief, shaped his storytelling and the themes of his literary works."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The idea behind a time-fluid committee is to enable collaboration and productivity among individuals who may not have the same availability or work within the same time constraints. Key features of a time-fluid committee include: 1. Flexible scheduling: Members of a time-fluid committee are not required to adhere to a rigid schedule or participate in meetings at set times. This allows individuals to collaborate when it is convenient for them, leading to increased participation, engagement, and overall efficiency. 2. Asynchronous communication: Time-fluid committees rely heavily on asynchronous communication, such as email, online forums, and collaborative project management tools. This ensures that important discussions and decision-making processes can take place even if members cannot be present at the same time. 3. Task-based organization: Time-fluid committees often organize their work around specific tasks or deliverables, rather than rigid time-based schedules. This allows members to focus on accomplishing goals in a manner that works best for their individual circumstances. 4. Emphasis on personal accountability: In a time-fluid committee, members are generally expected to take personal responsibility for their contributions and overall productivity. This necessitates a high level of trust and accountability among the group, as well as clear communication of expectations. Second question: What epic reason should be there to quit from someone's relationship? An epic reason to quit a relationship would be a reason that significantly impacts the foundation, dynamics, or overall health of the relationship. While every situation is unique, an epic reason typically falls under one or multiple categories. Here are some examples: 1. Irreconcilable differences: This refers to conflicting ideas, values, or beliefs that are so profound that they create an insurmountable barrier to the relationship. Examples include fundamental disagreements on core life values, lifestyle choices, religion, or parenting styles. 2. Abuse or toxicity: Any form of abuse – physical, emotional, or psychological – is a valid reason to leave a relationship. This includes ongoing patterns of manipulation, control, or toxic behavior that undermines one's mental health, safety, and overall well-being. 3. Betrayal or dishonesty: Trust is the foundation of any healthy relationship, and a significant betrayal or pattern of dishonesty can irreparably damage that trust. Examples include ongoing infidelity, hidden addictions, or purposeful deception regarding crucial aspects of one's life. 4. Incompatibility or lack of fulfillment: Over time, people may change, and it may become evident that the partners are no longer compatible or unable to meet each other's emotional needs. Incompatibility or lack of fulfillment may result from differing visions for the future, emotional disconnect, or other substantial barriers hindering personal growth and happiness. In conclusion, the two questions are not asking the same thing. The first question pertains to a particular type of committee that operates in a flexible, time-independent manner. The second question focuses on the reasons one might opt to end a relationship, specifically those reasons that are particularly significant or severe in nature."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:The answer to the question: What is the last name of the person that played at Melbourne's Royal Exhibition Building? is inside the article: Except for three months' formal schooling as a 12-year-old, during which he was bullied and ridiculed by his classmates, Percy was educated at home.  Rose, an autodidact with a dominating presence, supervised his music and literature studies and engaged other tutors for languages, art and drama. From his earliest lessons, Percy developed a lifelong fascination with Nordic culture; writing late in life, he said that the Icelandic Saga of Grettir the Strong was \\"the strongest single artistic influence on my life\\". As well as showing precocious musical talents, he displayed considerable early gifts as an artist, to the extent that his tutors thought his future might lie in art rather than music. At the age of 10 he began studying piano under Louis Pabst, a German immigrant then considered to be Melbourne's leading piano teacher. Grainger's first known composition, \\"A Birthday Gift to Mother\\", is dated 1893. Pabst arranged Grainger's first public concert appearances, at Melbourne's Masonic Hall in July and September 1894. The boy played works by Bach, Beethoven, Schumann and Scarlatti, and was warmly complimented in the Melbourne press.After Pabst returned to Europe in the autumn of 1894, Grainger's new piano tutor, Adelaide Burkitt, arranged for his appearances at a series of concerts in October 1894, at Melbourne's Royal Exhibition Building. The size of this enormous venue horrified the young pianist; nevertheless, his performance delighted the Melbourne critics, who dubbed him \\"the flaxen-haired phenomenon who plays like a master\\". This public acclaim helped Rose to decide that her son should continue his studies at  the Hoch Conservatory in Frankfurt, Germany, an institution recommended by William Laver, head of piano studies at Melbourne's Conservatorium of music. Financial assistance was secured through a fund-raising benefit concert in Melbourne and a final recital in Adelaide, after which mother and son left Australia for Europe on 29 May 1895. Although Grainger never returned permanently to Australia, he..., can you guess it ? A:","output":"Yes, the last name of the person that played at Melbourne's Royal Exhibition Building is Grainger.

What is the final step of the following process: -  A larva is born - The caterpillar eats constantly until it grows bigger - The caterpillar starts to form a cocoon around itself - The caterpillar becomes a pupa - After some time the cocoon hatches","output":"The final step of the process is: The adult butterfly (or moth) emerges from the cocoon. Step-by-step justification: 1. First, a larva is born, which is the beginning stage of a butterfly or moth's life cycle. 2. The larva, also known as a caterpillar, eats constantly in order to grow bigger and store energy for the upcoming metamorphosis. 3. Once it reaches the appropriate size and development stage, the caterpillar starts to form a cocoon (or chrysalis) around itself, providing a protective shell for the transformation. 4. Inside the cocoon, the caterpillar becomes a pupa, which is the third stage of the life cycle. During this stage, the caterpillar undergoes significant changes, rearranging its cells and structures to develop the features of an adult butterfly or moth. 5. After some time, typically ranging from several days to weeks depending on the species, the cocoon hatches. 6. The final step is the emergence of the fully developed adult butterfly (or moth) from the cocoon. This stage is known as the imago stage, and the butterfly or moth is now ready to mate, reproduce and start the cycle anew."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

This magnificent work of art, standing at 17 feet tall (5.17 meters), was completed between 1501 and 1504. Made from a single block of Carrara marble, the sculpture represents the biblical hero David and is considered one of the masterpieces of the High Renaissance period. The city of Florence has a deep connection with the Statue of David, stemming from its historical significance and artistic value. Initially, the statue was commissioned for the Cathedral of Florence, known as \\"Il Duomo,\\" to be part of a series of sculptures placed along its roofline. However, due to its monumental size and weight, the decision was made to install it at ground level instead. In 1504, shortly after its completion, the Statue of David was placed in front of the Palazzo della Signoria (now known as Palazzo Vecchio), the seat of civic power in the city at that time. It served as a powerful symbol of the Florentine Republic's resilience and defiance against external threats, particularly in relation to its rival city-states and the ruling Medici family. Over time, exposure to the elements caused deterioration of the marble, leading to the decision to move the statue indoors for preservation. In 1873, the original Statue of David was moved to the Galleria dell'Accademia in Florence, where it stands today as the gallery's pride and main attraction. A replica of the statue was installed at the original site in Piazza della Signoria to maintain the symbolic connection to the city’s history. Visitors to Florence can admire the original Statue of David at the Galleria dell'Accademia, experiencing the awe-inspiring work of Michelangelo up close. In addition to the Accademia Gallery, there are other replicas to be found in various locations in Florence, such as the one in Piazza della Signoria and another in the outdoor sculpture display at the Piazzale Michelangelo. This enduring masterpiece is not only a testament to Michelangelo's exceptional artistic skill but also a symbol of the cultural, historical, and political legacy of Florence, Italy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

With few exceptions, all elements are under command of the Surgeon General for domestic support and force generation, or temporarily assigned under command of a deployed Joint Task Force through Canadian Joint Operations Command.\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"In the context of military operations and formations, groups of troops sent away on a separate mission are generally called \\"detachments\\" or \\"task forces.\\" These terms can be better understood when broken down and explained with reference to the provided context of the Health Services Group within the Canadian Armed Forces. 1. Detachments: A detachment is a smaller unit of troops temporarily separated from their parent unit to perform a specific mission or duty. In the context of the Health Services Group, detachments are smaller groups of personnel and resources that can be sent to provide medical support and health services to various Canadian Armed Forces operations or domestic support as required. These detachments can consist of general or specialized units, depending on the needs of the mission. Once their assigned tasks are complete, they will typically rejoin their parent unit. 2. Task Forces: A task force, on the other hand, is a temporary formation of units or groups of troops assembled to achieve a specific objective or conduct a joint operation. These task forces are usually composed of different types of units that possess complementary capabilities, enabling them to carry out a wide range of tasks. In the context of the Health Services Group, when a detachment or a specialized unit is assigned under the command of a deployed Joint Task Force through the Canadian Joint Operations Command, it becomes part of a larger formation with a specific mission to accomplish. In summary, groups of troops sent away on a separate mission within the Health Services Group of the Canadian Armed Forces, or any military organization, are commonly referred to as detachments or task forces. Detachments are smaller units temporarily separated from their parent unit for a specific mission, while task forces are temporary formations of various units with complementary capabilities working together to achieve a common objective. Both terms are used to describe the flexible and adaptable nature of military forces when responding to different operational needs and requirements."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If there are dominant and recessive genes, how can a white/black pair of parents can never have a black/white baby? Why does my best friend have weird eyebrows? On the right side her eyebrows and eyelashes are white but the left side is black. Do those questions have the same meaning?","output":"These questions do not have the same meaning, but they are related in the sense that they both involve genetics and inheritance of traits. I will address each question separately. 1. Regarding the pairing between white and black parents: In order to have a child that is either black or white, the parents must both carry the genes for these traits. Skin color is determined by multiple genes, but we can simplify the concept by looking at a single gene that influences pigmentation. The dominant gene (B) may code for darker skin, while the recessive gene (b) may lead to lighter skin.  A black parent could have the gene pair (BB) or (Bb), while a white parent would have the gene pair (bb). When a black parent with (BB) genes and a white parent with (bb) genes have a child, the child will inherit one gene from each parent. In this case, the child would inherit (Bb), resulting in them having darker skin, as the dominant gene (B) is expressed. However, since the child carries the recessive (b) gene, they can potentially pass down lighter skin to their offspring if they have a child with a partner who also has a (b) gene. If a black parent has the (Bb) gene pair and a white parent has the (bb) gene pair, there is a 50% chance the child will inherit (Bb) and have darker skin, and a 50% chance the child will have lighter skin (bb). In summary, a white/black pair of parents can have a black/white baby depending on the specific combination of genes they carry and pass down to their children. 2. Regarding your friend's eyebrows: The variation in your friend's eyebrows and eyelashes color could be due to a genetic condition called Waardenburg syndrome. This syndrome affects pigmentation and can cause a person to have patches of lighter hair, eyebrows, and eyelashes, as well as different eye colors. Waardenburg syndrome is caused by a mutation in one of several genes and may be inherited. Even if your friend doesn't have Waardenburg syndrome, the different coloration could still be due to genetics. Hair and eyebrow color are determined by the amount and type of pigmentation produced by melanocytes (pigment-producing cells). The pigmentation can be influenced by several genes, so it is possible that your friend inherited a unique combination of genes that created the distinct eyebrow and eyelash coloration. In conclusion, these questions are related to genetics and inheritance, but they address two different topics: skin color in offspring resulting from mixed relationships and the unique pigmentation of a person's eyebrows/eyelashes."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Patriots quarterback Tom Brady threw for a career second-best 466 yards, as he completed 38 of 59 pass attempts with three touchdown throws, as the Patriots were able to hold off a late Buffalo Bills rally thanks to their high-octane offense, giving the Patriots their first divisional win of the season. The match-up between the Bills and Patriots was highly anticipated in the week before the meeting. Both teams had won their first games of the new season and high expectations for the season ahead were falling on both teams, including the host team, who were led by new head coach and old Patriots' foe Rex Ryan (formerly of the New York Jets). The Guinness Book of World Records was invited to Ralph Wilson Stadium to see if the Bills' fans could break the decibel record for crowd noise that was set at Arrowhead Stadium by Kansas City Chiefs' fans in the season prior (coincidentally in a game that the Patriots also featured in as the away team). In a heated game-day atmosphere, the Bills took the opening kickoff and drove the ball 80-yards in ten plays, with rookie running back Karlos Williams scoring on a 2-yard run. Two possessions later, the Patriots, aided by completions of 16 and 36 yards to Aaron Dobson and Gronkowski respectively, raced 62 yards in only 5 plays, with Julian Edelman catching an 8-yard touchdown pass from Brady. After another Bills three-and-out, aided by a 28-yard punt return to the Bills 27 by Danny Amendola coupled with an unnecessary roughness penalty on the Bills, the Patriots need just two plays to go 13 yards and score on a 6-yard touchdown run by Dion Lewis, taking a 14-7 lead. On the ensuing Bills' drive, Tyrod Taylor was intercepted by Super Bowl hero Malcolm Butler, who returned it 9 yards to the Bills 30. The Patriots then marched 30 yards in just 5 plays, scoring on Brady's 6-yard touchdown pass to Gronkowski, extending the lead to 21-7. After a Bills punt, from the Bills 48, Lewis caught a 6-yard pass, but was stripped by Paul Brown with Corey Graham returning it 29 yards to the Patriots 33, but an unnecessary roughness penalty moved them back to the 48. After being forced to punt, the Patriots drove to the Bills 48, but on 4th-and-1 Brady fired an incomplete pass. The Bills finally scored again, racing 48 yards in four penalty marred plays, scoring on a 9-yard touchdown pass to Charles Clay, trimming the deficit to 21-13, after a missed PAT. The Patriots drove to the Bills 28 on their next drive and Stephen Gostkowski converted a 46-yard field goal, increasing the lead to 24-13. The Bills advanced the ball to the 50-yard line on the next drive, but Taylor was intercepted by Harmon a deep pass intended for wide receiver Sammy Watkins with 16 seconds remaining in the half. Brady took a knee on the ensuing drive, with the Patriots going into the half leading 24-13. The Patriots drove 77 yards on the opening drive, all the way to the Bills 3-yard line, but were forced to settle for a 21-yard field goal by Gostkowski, making the score 27-13. After a Bills punt, the Patriots raced 83 yards in 9 plays, with Brady capping off the drive with a 22-yard touchdown pass to a diving Edelman, growing the lead to 34-13. After a Bills three-and-out, the Patriots drove to the Bills 32 and Gostkowski upping the lead to 37-13 on a 50-yard field goal. As the game entered the fourth quarter and with many Bills fans already heading for the exits, the Bills were finally able to establish rhythm with their offense, as Taylor led Buffalo on a 10-play, 80-yard drive, bombing a 32-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Robert Woods, with a failed two-point conversion, making the score 37-19.  The Patriots drove to the Bills 41 on their next drive, but failed to convert. The Bills quickly capitalized, racing 59 yards in only 7 plays, with Taylor running in a 7-yard touchdown, with a missed two-point conversion, trimming the deficit to just 37-25. On the second play of the ensuing Patriots drive, Brady was strip-sacked by Jerry Hughes , with Preston Brown recovering for the Bills at midfield. It only took two plays to cover 50 yards, with Taylor finding Watkins for a 24-yard touchdown, making the score just 37-32 after being down 37-13. As had been the theme throughout the day, the Bills' defense was unable to keep Brady and the Patriots' offense from marching up-and-down the field, and on their final drive, New England drove to the Bills 8 and Gostkowski upped the lead to 40-32 on his 26-yard field goal. On the Bills' first play of the Bills next drive, Taylor was intercepted for the third time of the day, this time by cornerback Logan Ryan at the 50-yard line on a long pass intended for Watkins. Brady kneeled on the ensuing drive, securing the 40-32 win. The Bills' fans failed to set the Guinness World Record for loudest crowd noise.

Patty was a runner and liked hiking so she spent a lot of time outdoors. Her friend Fay sealed up her home to save money on energy and spent most of her time indoors. Both friends lived in an area with moderate to high levels of air pollution and attended a seminar where they learned more about the impact of air pollution on human health.  Which friend spent less time breathing fresh air? The answer to this question is:","output":"Fay spent less time breathing fresh air compared to Patty. Though both friends lived in an area with moderate to high levels of air pollution, their lifestyles played a significant role in determining their exposure to fresh air. Patty, being an outdoor enthusiast who enjoyed running and hiking, spent much more time outside. This allowed her to breathe in the fresh air when she was in less polluted areas, such as parks, trails, or other natural settings away from the sources of air pollution commonly found in urban and industrial zones. Her outdoor activities also promoted better blood circulation and overall health, further improving her body's ability to combat any potential ill effects of air pollution. On the other hand, Fay chose to seal up her home in order to save money on energy. As a result, she spent most of her time indoors. While this decision may have reduced her energy consumption, it also limited the amount of fresh air that could enter her home. Indoor air pollution can come from various sources such as cooking, cleaning products, pets, mold, and even outdoor air pollution that enters the home. Being indoors most of the time, Fay was more susceptible to the harmful effects of indoor air pollutants. Furthermore, her limited time outdoors meant that she had fewer opportunities to breathe in cleaner, fresher air. It is important to note that while spending time outdoors can provide Patty with better access to fresh air, she still lived in an area with moderate to high air pollution. Therefore, it is crucial for both friends to be mindful of the air quality and take necessary precautions such as avoiding outdoor activities during times of high pollution, using air purifiers at home or keeping indoor environments well-ventilated. In conclusion, although both Patty and Fay lived in an area with moderate to high levels of air pollution, Patty spent more time breathing fresh air due to her outdoor activities, as compared to Fay who spent most of her time indoors with a sealed home. Nevertheless, both friends should remain cautious and attentive to the air quality in their environment to minimize the impact of pollution on their health."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Here is a news article: In the weeks following her father’s inauguration, Ivanka Trump quietly reached out to the president of Planned Parenthood seeking common ground on the contentious issue of abortion.      The first daughter requested a sit-down with Cecile Richards, the head of Planned Parenthood and a vocal surrogate for Hillary Clinton on the 2016 campaign trail, to talk about an organization that is being targeted by Republicans seeking to defund it because it provides abortions, among other women’s health services like cancer screenings.      Story Continued Below      Their under-the-radar meeting — a rarity between a well-known Democratic activist and a close adviser to a Republican president — has not been previously reported.      “The purpose of the meeting, from Cecile’s point of view, was to make sure that Ivanka fully understood what Planned Parenthood does, how it is funded, and why it would be a terrible idea for Planned Parenthood to be removed from being able to see Medicaid patients,” said Dawn Laguens, executive vice president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America. “The main thing that Cecile Richards was doing was explaining that the money doesn’t actually go to abortions — we get reimbursed the same way a hospital does. We were clearing up misinformation about how this works.”      Richards also shares a unique perspective with Ivanka Trump: She, too, is a political daughter (her mother was former Texas Gov. Ann Richards) with big personal ambitions focused on fighting for women's empowerment. Laguens called it “an explainer meeting” and said that Ivanka Trump had expressed an interest in wanting “to know more about the facts of Planned Parenthood.”      Ivanka Trump has been on a listening tour since moving to Washington, as she stakes a claim on women's issues. In addition to her meeting with Richards, she has quietly met with other leaders of the progressive women’s movement, including Marcia Greenberger, co-president the National Women's Law Center, and Judy Lichtman, senior adviser to the National Partnership for Women and Family, sources familiar with the meetings told POLITICO.      But the strategic outreach hasn’t seemed to earn Ivanka Trump much public goodwill. Since Ivanka Trump’s sit-down with Richards, what started as a cordial relationship has soured — and any effort on the part of the politically savvy first daughter to back-channel to the nonprofit has transformed into a bitter battle since Ivanka Trump assumed an official administration post.      Richards, fighting the Trump administration, has publicly rebuked Ivanka Trump for her “deafening” silence on the GOP health care bill. On Wednesday night, Richards again took aim at the first daughter, now a senior White House official with a security clearance and an office in the West Wing.      “Anyone who works in this White House is responsible for addressing why women are in the cross hairs of basically every single policy we've seen in this administration,” Richards said, speaking at the Women in the World conference in New York City.      The public lashing of Ivanka Trump stems from a sense, among Planned Parenthood advocates, that as someone who has staked her reputation on fighting for women’s economic empowerment, Ivanka Trump must be held accountable for her silence.      “You don’t get to have it both ways,” Laguens said. “You don’t get to say, I’m all for economic empowerment, and ignore that 30 percent of wage gains are directly attributable to access to birth control. You don’t get to say women should have great child care when maternity benefits are on the chopping block.”      Last month, Vice President Mike Pence broke a 50-50 vote in the Senate to roll back a rule that barred states from denying family planning grants to Planned Parenthood. Ivanka Trump did not weigh in.      Ivanka Trump declined to comment for this story.      In an interview with Gayle King that aired on CBS Wednesday morning, Ivanka Trump defended her role both as a champion of women and as someone who is choosing to stay away from the public fight to defund Planned Parenthood.      “I would say not to conflate lack of public denouncement with silence,” she said. “I think there are multiple ways to have your voice heard. In some cases, it’s through protest and it’s through going on the nightly news and talking about or denouncing every issue on which you disagree with. Other times, it is quietly and directly and candidly. So where I disagree with my father, he knows it.”      Planned Parenthood, which receives about 550 million in federal funding annually, has been a stumbling block for Ivanka Trump — one that advocates on the left have set up as a test of her commitment to fighting for women’s rights, and that her defenders argue is an unfair albatross. The New York Times reported last month that the White House had pitched the organization on a plan that would please the conservative base while seeking common ground with Democrats — allowing it to retain its federal payments if it stopped providing abortions. But that was an immediate non-starter for the group.      In her interview with King, Ivanka Trump defended her position, arguing that she is playing a long game, and that speaking out on issues where she doesn’t see a win won’t help her be effective in the White House.      “I’ll take hits from some critics who say that I should take to the street,” she said. “And then other people will, in the long term, respect where I get to. But I think most of the impact I have, over time, most people will not actually know about.” She has also noted that the line item for women’s health increased in the Trump administration’s proposed budget.      The attacks lobbed at her from Planned Parenthood executives are seen by people close to Ivanka Trump as misguided: Even if she were publicly engaged, Ivanka Trump would not be able to sway a Republican House and Senate on the issue. The thinking is that no amount of advocacy on her part, when it comes to sticking up for a group that has long symbolized the fight against a woman’s right to choose, could help.

President Donald Trump has been more open to Planned Parenthood than many of the lawmakers who control the levers of funding — a sign that it is not his viewpoint, the one over which Ivanka Trump holds the most sway, that needs to be changed.      “Millions and millions of women — cervical cancer, breast cancer — are helped by Planned Parenthood,” Trump said during a presidential debate in February 2016. “I would defund it because I’m pro-life, but millions of women are helped by Planned Parenthood.” And in the past, Trump had also supported abortion rights. ||||| The president's daughter has responded to criticism about her brought up in a \\"Saturday Night Live\\" sketch -- because this is politics in 2017.      However, Ivanka Trump's reply to a question asking if she is \\"complicit\\" in her dad's presidency has confused everyone.      It has even led some to believe the first lady daughter doesn't actually know what the word means -- so clearly, she hasn't been keeping up with \\"SNL.\\"      REUTERS      In an interview with CBS's's Gayle King, her first since Donald Trump became president, Ivanka said,      I don't know what it means to be complicit, but you know, I hope time will prove that I have done a good job and much more importantly that my father's administration is the success that I know it will be.      I mean, she even said herself she doesn't know what it means.      Luckily for Ivanka, she's been given a helping hand by the Merriam-Webster dictionary, who waded into the debate on Twitter and defined it as \\"helping to commit a crime or do wrong in some way.\\"      Twitter      In the interview, the newly appointed assistant to the president said,      If being complicit is wanting to, is wanting to be a force for good and to make a positive impact, then I'm complicit. I don't know that the critics who may say that of me, if they found themselves in this very unique and unprecedented situation that I am now in, would do any differently than I am doing.      The interview took place weeks after Scarlett Johansson played Ivanka in an \\"SNL\\" sketch advertising her new perfume, \\"Complicit.\\"      Saturday Night Live on YouTube      Ivanka regularly speaks out about women's issues, but despite that, she has been criticized for failing to denounce the alleged sexism of the Trump presidency.      Some have labeled her complicit for not intervening with his controversial policies that attack women.      Most recently, eyebrows were raised when she tweeted to celebrate Equal Pay Day just days after the president removed protections for women in the workplace brought in under Barack Obama.

It is used to assist in the growing of agricultural crops, maintenance of landscapes, and revegetation of disturbed soils in dry areas and during periods of inadequate rainfall. Additionally, irrigation also has a few other uses in crop production, which include protecting plants against frost, suppressing weed growth in grain fields and preventing soil consolidation. In contrast, agriculture that relies only on direct rainfall is referred to as rain-fed or dry land farming.  - New South Wales (abbreviated as NSW) is a state on the east coast of :Australia.

Plains occur as lowlands along the bottoms of valleys, coastal plains and as plateaus or uplands at high elevations. In a valley, a plain is enclosed on two sides but in other cases a plain may be delineated by a complete or partial ring of hills, by mountains or cliffs. Where a geological region contains more than one plain, they may be connected by a pass (sometime termed a gap). Plains may have been formed from flowing lava, deposited by water, ice, wind, or formed by erosion by these agents from hills and mountains.  - The Riverina  is an agricultural region of south-western New South Wales (NSW), Australia. The Riverina is distinguished from other Australian regions by the combination of flat plains, warm to hot climate and an ample supply of water for irrigation. This combination has allowed the Riverina to develop into one of the most productive and agriculturally diverse areas of Australia.

Through your discussion of how they feel, they begin to learn words associated with those feelings and can later use those words to talk out their feelings. This will help them transition to talking about feelings instead of acting out their frustrations. You might say something like “I know you are sad that it is bedtime, but we can play with your toys again tomorrow.” It is important to observe how your children play and act out to understand their feelings. By watching and understanding your toddler’s feelings you can more effectively discuss them. You can also teach your toddler to express their feelings in more socially constructive ways. If your toddler is angry, you might say something like “I know that you are upset that the candy is gone, but you cannot hit people. Instead, you can show us you are upset by taking a deep breath and just telling us you are upset.” Toddlers need to understand what is expected of them. They will naturally push the boundaries, but if you set firm limits and give explanations for those limits, most toddlers will begin to respect the rules. This gives them the structure and boundaries they need to feel secure. Emphasize the positive aspects of rules with your toddler. For example, explain that the your child must get enough sleep tonight so that he or she can have more fun tomorrow. Babies do not interact very well with each other, but once children start to reach the toddler phase, they begin to socialize a bit with other kids. Encourage your toddler to make friends, and teach him or her how to do things like introduce him or herself. This is one of the early milestones in socializing your child. Do not be surprised if your toddler plays more “beside” the other children than they play “with” the other children. Parallel play is common in this stage. Summary:","output":"Discussing feelings with your toddler is crucial for their emotional development and learning how to express themselves. As they begin to understand and associate words with certain emotions, they can later use those words to communicate effectively. Observing and understanding your toddler's feelings helps you to guide them in expressing their emotions in a more constructive manner. Setting firm limits and boundaries while explaining the reasoning behind them instills a sense of security in your child. Focus on the positive aspects of rules, highlighting the benefits, and encourage your toddler to socialize with other children.

Help as much as you can. Q:Information:  - A student or pupil is a learner, or someone who attends an educational institution. In Britain those attending university are termed \\"students\\". In the United States, and more recently also in Britain, the term \\"student\\" is applied to both categories. In its widest use, \\"student\\" is used for anyone who is learning, including mid-career adults who are taking vocational education or returning to university. When speaking about learning outside an institution, \\"student\\" is also used to refer to someone who is learning a topic or who is \\"a student of\\" a certain topic or person.  - Physics (from , from \\"phúsis\\" \\"nature\\") is the natural science that involves the study of matter and its motion and behavior through space and time, along with related concepts such as energy and force. One of the most fundamental scientific disciplines, the main goal of physics is to understand how the universe behaves.  - The Nobel Prize (; Swedish definite form, singular: \\"Nobelpriset\\") is a set of annual international awards bestowed in a number of categories by Swedish and Norwegian institutions in recognition of academic, cultural, and/or scientific advances.  - The City of New York, often called New York City or simply New York, is the most populous city in the United States. With an estimated 2015 population of 8,550,405 distributed over a land area of just , New York City is also the most densely populated major city in the United States. Located at the southern tip of the state of New York, the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area, one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world. A global power city, New York City exerts a significant impact upon commerce, finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education, and entertainment, its fast pace defining the term \\"New York minute\\". Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an important center for international diplomacy and has been described as the cultural and financial capital of the world.  - A research university is a university that expects all its tenured and tenure-track faculty to continuously engage in research, as opposed to merely requiring it as a condition of an initial appointment or tenure. Such universities can be recognized by their strong focus on innovative research and the prestige of their brand names. On the one hand, research universities strive to recruit faculty who are the most brilliant minds in their disciplines in the world, and their students enjoy the opportunity to learn from such experts. On the other hand, new students are often disappointed to realize their undergraduate courses at research universities are overly academic and fail to provide vocational training with immediate \\"real world\\" applications; but many employers value degrees from research universities because they know that such coursework develops fundamental skills like critical thinking.   - Miami University (also referred to as Miami U, Miami of Ohio, Miami University, Ohio, or simply Miami) is a coeducational public research university located in Oxford, Ohio, United States. Founded in 1809, although classes were not held until 1824, it is the 10th oldest public university in the United States and the second oldest university in Ohio. In its 2017 edition, U.S. News & World Report ranked the university 79th among national universities, the 30th top public school, and 2nd (1st among public institutions) for best undergraduate teaching at national universities.   - Dominions were semi-independent polities under the British Crown, constituting the British Empire, beginning with Canadian Confederation in 1867. They included Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Newfoundland, South Africa, and the Irish Free State, and then from the late 1940s also India, Pakistan, and Ceylon (now Sri Lanka). The Balfour Declaration of 1926 recognised the Dominions as \\"autonomous Communities within the British Empire\\", and the 1931 Statute of Westminster granted them full legislative independence.  - George Mason (sometimes referred to as George Mason IV;  October 7, 1792) was a Virginia planter and politician, and a delegate to the U.S. Constitutional Convention of 1787, one of three delegates who refused to sign the constitution. His writings have been a significant influence on political thought and events, including substantial portions of the Fairfax Resolves of 1774, the Virginia Declaration of Rights of 1776, and his \\"Objections to this Constitution of Government\\" (1787) in opposition to ratification of the constitution. The Virginia Declaration of Rights, which Mason principally authored, served as a basis for the United States Bill of Rights, of which he has been deemed the father.  - The Chesapeake Bay is an estuary lying inland from the Atlantic Ocean, and surrounded by the North American mainland to the west, and the Delmarva Peninsula to the east. It is the largest such body in the contiguous United States. The northern bay is within Maryland, the southern portion within Virginia, and is a very important feature for the ecology and economy of those two states, as well as others. More than 150 major rivers and streams flow into the bay's drainage basin, which covers parts of six states (New York, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia and West Virginia) plus all of the District of Columbia.  - Economics (, ) is a social science concerned with the factors that determine the production, distribution, and consumption of goods and services. The term \\"economics\\" comes from the Ancient Greek from (', pronounced \\"eekos\\", \\"house\\") and (', \\"custom\\" or \\"law\\"), hence \\"rules of the house (hold for good management)\\". 'Political economy' was the earlier name for the subject, but economists in the late 19th century suggested \\"economics\\" as a shorter term for \\"economic science\\" to establish itself as a separate discipline outside of political science and other social sciences.  - Law is a system of rules that are created and enforced through social or governmental institutions to regulate behavior. State-enforced laws can be made by a collective legislature or by a single legislator, resulting in statutes, by the executive through decrees and regulations, or established by judges through precedent, normally in common law jurisdictions. Private individuals can create legally binding contracts, including arbitration agreements that may elect to accept alternative arbitration to the normal court process. The formation of laws themselves may be influenced by a constitution, written or tacit, and the rights encoded therein. The law shapes politics, economics, history and society in various ways and serves as a mediator of relations between people.  - In physics, a force is any interaction that, when unopposed, will change the motion of an object. In other words, a force can cause an object with mass to change its velocity (which includes to begin moving from a state of rest), i.e., to accelerate. Force can also be described intuitively as a push or a pull. A force has both magnitude and direction, making it a vector quantity. It is measured in the SI unit of newtons and represented by the symbol F.  - The Institute for Science and International Security (ISIS) is a nonprofit, non-governmental institution (Not to be confused with Islamic State - ISIS) to inform the public about \\"science and policy issues affecting international security.\\" Founded in 1993, the group is led by founder and former United Nations IAEA nuclear inspector David Albright. ISIS was founded on a belief that scientists have an obligation to participate actively in solving major problems of national and international security. ISIS focuses primarily on four parts: 1) prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and related technology to other nations and terrorists, 2) lead to greater transparency of nuclear activities worldwide, 3) reinforce the international non-proliferation regime, and 4) cut down nuclear arsenals. Furthermore, ISIS seeks to build stable foundations for various efforts to reduce the threat posed by nuclear weapons to U.S. and international security by integrating technical, scientific and policy research. As the effectiveness of ISIS was appreciated and recognized in the Global Go-To Think Tanks rankings, ISIS consistently places in the top 25 Science and Technology Think Tanks in the world and in 2015 placed as one of the top United States and foreign policy think tanks in the world.  - Natural science is a branch of science concerned with the description, prediction, and understanding of natural phenomena, based on observational and empirical evidence. Mechanisms such as peer review and repeatability of findings are used to try to ensure the validity of scientific advances.  - A master's degree (from Latin \\"magister\\") is a second-cycle academic degree awarded by universities or colleges upon completion of a course of study demonstrating mastery or a high-order overview of a specific field of study or area of professional practice. A master's degree normally requires previous study at the bachelor's level, either as a separate degree or as part of an integrated course. Within the area studied, master's graduates are expected to possess advanced knowledge of a specialized body of theoretical and applied topics; high order skills in analysis, critical evaluation, or professional application; and the ability to solve complex problems and think rigorously and independently.  - Wright State University is a public research university in Fairborn, Ohio, a suburb of Dayton. Originally operating as a branch campus for Ohio State University and Miami University, Wright State became an independent institution in 1967. Its name honors the aviation pioneers Orville and Wilbur Wright, who were residents of Dayton. In 1969, a branch campus opened on the shore of Grand Lake St. Marys in Celina, Ohio. The university offers degrees at the bachelors, masters, and doctoral level.  - The Ohio State University, commonly referred to as Ohio State or OSU, is a public university in Columbus, Ohio. Founded in 1870 as a land-grant university and ninth university in Ohio with the Morrill Act of 1862, the university was originally known as the Ohio Agricultural and Mechanical College (Mech). The college began with a focus on training students in various agricultural and mechanical disciplines but was developed into a comprehensive university under the direction of Governor Rutherford B. Hayes, and in 1878 the Ohio General Assembly passed a law changing the name to \\"The Ohio State University\\". It has since grown into the third-largest university campus in the United States. Along with its main campus in Columbus, Ohio State also operates a regional campus system with regional campuses in Lima, Mansfield, Marion, Newark, and Wooster.  - Purdue University is a public research university located in West Lafayette, Indiana and is the main campus of the Purdue University system. The university was founded in 1869 after Lafayette businessman John Purdue donated land and money to establish a college of science, technology, and agriculture in his name. The first classes were held on September 16, 1874, with six instructors and 39 students.  - In physics, energy is the property that must be transferred to an object in order to perform work on  or to heat  the object, and can be converted in form, but not created or destroyed. The SI unit of energy is the joule, which is the energy transferred to an object by the mechanical work of moving it a distance of 1 metre against a force of 1 newton.  - Virginia (, officially the Commonwealth of Virginia) is a state located in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States, as well as in the historic Southeast. Virginia is nicknamed the \\"Old Dominion\\" due to its status as the first colonial possession established in mainland British America, and \\"Mother of Presidents\\" because eight U.S. presidents were born there, more than any other state. The geography and climate of the Commonwealth are shaped by the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Chesapeake Bay, which provide habitat for much of its flora and fauna. The capital of the Commonwealth is Richmond; Virginia Beach is the most populous city, and Fairfax County is the most populous political subdivision. The Commonwealth's estimated population is over 8.3 million, which is slightly less than New York City.  - Creative writing is any writing that goes outside the bounds of normal professional, journalistic, academic, or technical forms of literature, typically identified by an emphasis on narrative craft, character development, and the use of literary tropes or with various traditions of poetry and poetics. Due to the looseness of the definition, it is possible for writing such as feature stories to be considered creative writing, even though they fall under journalism, because the content of features is specifically focused on narrative and character development. Both fictional and non-fictional works fall into this category, including such forms as novels, biographies, short stories, and poems. In the academic setting, creative writing is typically separated into fiction and poetry classes, with a focus on writing in an original style, as opposed to imitating pre-existing genres such as crime or horror. Writing for the screen and stagescreenwriting and playwrightingare often taught separately, but fit under the creative writing category as well.  - The Blue Ridge Mountains are a physiographic province of the larger Appalachian Mountains range. This province consists of northern and southern physiographic regions, which divide near the Roanoke River gap. The mountain range is located in the eastern United States, starting at its southernmost portion in Georgia, then ending northward in Pennsylvania. To the west of the Blue Ridge, between it and the bulk of the Appalachians, lies the Great Appalachian Valley, bordered on the west by the Ridge and Valley province of the Appalachian range.  - George Mason University (also Mason), located in Fairfax, Virginia, United States, is the largest public research university in the Commonwealth of Virginia. The university was founded as a branch of the University of Virginia in 1957 and became an independent institution in 1972. Today, Mason is recognized for its programs in economics, law, creative writing, computer science, and business. In recent years, George Mason faculty have twice won the Nobel Prize in Economics. The university enrolls 33,917 students, making it the largest university by head count in the Commonwealth of Virginia.  - David Albright , M.Sc. , is the founder of the non-governmental Institute for Science and International Security ( ISIS ) , its current president , and author of several books on proliferation of atomic weapons . Albright holds a Master of Science in physics from Indiana University and a M.Sc . in mathematics from Wright State University . He has taught physics at George Mason University in Virginia . From 1990 to 2001 , Albright was a member of the Colorado State Health Advisory Panel , participating in its assessment of the toxicological and radiological effects on the population near the Rocky Flats atomic weapons production site . 1992 -- 97 , David Albright was associated with the International Atomic Energy Agency 's Action Team . In June 1996 , he was invited to be the first non-governmental inspector of Iraq 's nuclear program and questioned Iraqi officials about that country 's uranium enrichment program . In 2001 Albright prepared an analysis , for CNN , of documents found in an abandoned Al Qaeda safe house in Kabul believed to have been used by Abu Khabbab , who they described as \`\` Osama bin Laden 's top chemical and biological weapons commander . '' Albright confirmed the abandoned documents included plans for a nuclear bomb , and extensive training notes on the handling of radiological material . In September 2002 , Albright and his organization ISIS were the first to publicly criticize the claims of the Bush administration and the CIA about the infamous Iraqi aluminum tubes . In response to Iraqi aluminum tubes , Albright said it was far from clear that the tubes were intended for a uranium centrifuge . From the August / September 2003 American Journalism Review : \`\` On December 8 ( 2002 ) Bob Simon reported on 60 Minutes that the aluminum tubes story was being challenged . He quoted British intelligence officials and David Albright , a weapons inspector in Iraq for the U.N. in the 1990s . Albright said , ' People who understood gas centrifuges almost uniformly felt that these tubes were not...  - A thesis or dissertation is a document submitted in support of candidature for an academic degree or professional qualification presenting the author's research and findings. In some contexts, the word \\"thesis\\" or a cognate is used for part of a bachelor's or master's course, while \\"dissertation\\" is normally applied to a doctorate, while in other contexts, the reverse is true. The term graduate thesis is sometimes used to refer to both master's theses and doctoral dissertations.  - The University of Virginia (U.Va. or UVA), frequently referred to simply as Virginia, is a public flagship and research university. Founded in 1819 by Declaration of Independence author Thomas Jefferson, UVA is known for its historic foundations, student-run honor code, and secret societies.  - Indiana UniversityPurdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) is a public research university located in Indianapolis, Indiana.

Located along the White River and Fall Creek it sits upon a peninsula adjacent to Downtown Indianapolis.  - Computer science is the study of the theory, experimentation, and engineering that form the basis for the design and use of computers. It is the scientific and practical approach to computation and its applications and the systematic study of the feasibility, structure, expression, and mechanization of the methodical procedures (or algorithms) that underlie the acquisition, representation, processing, storage, communication of, and access to information. An alternate, more succinct definition of computer science is the study of automating algorithmic processes that scale. A computer scientist specializes in the theory of computation and the design of computational systems.  - In the classical physics observed in everyday life, if something has mass and takes up space, it is said to be composed of matter; this includes atoms (and thus molecules) and anything made up of these, but not other energy phenomena or waves such as light or sound. More generally, however, in (modern) physics, matter is not a fundamental concept because a universal definition of it is elusive: elementary constituents of atoms may not take up space individually, and massless particles may be composed to form objects that have mass (even when at rest).  - English America, and later British America, were the English, and later British, territories in North America (including Bermuda), Central America, the Caribbean, and Guyana from 1607 to 1783. Formally, the British colonies in North America were known as \\"British America and the British West Indies\\" until 1776, when the Thirteen British Colonies located along the Atlantic seaboard declared their independence and formed the United States of America. After that, British North America (or, simply but not inclusively, Canada) was used to describe the remainder of Britain's continental North American possessions. The term \\"British North America\\" was first used informally in 1783, but it was uncommon before the Report on the Affairs of British North America (1839), called the Durham Report.  - A Master of Science degree (abbreviated MS, MSc, MSci, ScM or SciM with or without punctuation) is a type of master's degree awarded by universities in many countries. The degree is usually contrasted with the Master of Arts degree. The Master of Science degree is typically granted for studies in sciences, engineering, and medicine, and is usually for programs that are more focused on scientific and mathematical subjects; however, different universities have different conventions and may also offer the degree for fields typically considered within the humanities and social sciences. While it ultimately depends upon the specific program, earning a Master of Science degree typically includes writing a thesis.  - Indiana University Bloomington (abbreviated \\"IU Bloomington\\" and colloquially referred to as \\"IU\\" or simply \\"Indiana\\") is a public research university located in Bloomington, Indiana, United States. With over 48,000 students, IU Bloomington is the flagship institution of the Indiana University system and its largest university.  - International security, also called global security, refers to the amalgamation of measures taken by states and international organizations, such as the United Nations, European Union, Association of Southeast Asian Nations, and others, to ensure mutual survival and safety. These measures include military action and diplomatic agreements such as treaties and conventions. International and national security are invariably linked. International security is national security or state security in the global arena.  - Indiana University (IU) is a multi-campus public university system in the state of Indiana, United States. Indiana University has a combined student body of more than 110,000 students, including approximately 46,000 students enrolled at the Indiana University Bloomington campus and approximately 31,000 students enrolled at the Indiana University  Purdue University Indianapolis (IUPUI) campus.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. By. James Rush. An inquisitive toddler had to be rescued by firefighters after getting her head stuck in a toilet training seat. Emily Pitt got her head wedged in her older brother's training seat after trying it on as a hat. Her mother, Sarah Pitt, at first laughed when her young daughter wandered into the living room with the seat around her neck - but then had to ring 999 when she was unable to get it off. Emily Pitt had to be freed by firefighters after she got her head wedged in her older brother's training seat. Ms Pitt, 35, said: 'I thought they would just give me advice on how to get it off - we spent 45 minutes trying to get it off and she was wedged in tight. 'We had to show her Peppa Pig on my iPhone to keep her quiet. The fire brigade showed up and carefully cut her free - I'm so grateful to them. 'Emily now keeps talking about how the firemen came and rescued her.' Emily wandered into the bathroom of their home in Tadworth, Surrey, on Saturday afternoon where she found her older brother Owen's training seat. She then toddled into the lounge with the seat around her neck, prompting her parents to contact the emergency services when they were unable to get it off. Mother-of-four Ms Pitt said: 'She wasn't in pain or anything - the seat wasn't tight around her neck or anything like that. Emily (right) wandered into the bathroom of their home in Tadworth, Surrey, on Saturday afternoon where she found her older brother Owen's training seat (left) 'Obviously, we wanted to get it off without hurting her. Firemen spent about five minutes cutting it off with a hacksaw blade. 'I would like to warn other parents that if their child gets in the same situation, ring 999 rather than attempting to cut it off yourself. 'Parents aren't trained to do things like this - but luckily firemen are.' She added: 'Emily's not the smallest two-year-old. She's quite big. It was a first for us and the fire station. 'It just goes to show I suppose that toilet training seats definitely shouldn't be used as a hat.' Emily's father Adam added: 'All my little girl keeps talking about is how the firemen helped her.' Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"A little girl named Emily Pitt found her older brother Owen's toilet training seat and thought it would be fun to wear it as a hat. But, her head got stuck in the seat, and her mom couldn't get it off. So, they called firefighters to come and help. They carefully cut the seat off Emily's head using a special tool. Everything was okay, and Emily was happy that the firefighters came to rescue her. It's important to remember not to use toilet training seats as hats because your head might get stuck."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Can Schools Punish Students Who Post Racy Photos Online? Two Indiana girls  one 16, one 15  took racy photos of themselves at a slumber party and posted them online. When their high school found out, it suspended the girls from participating in a certain amount of their extracurricular activities. Can the school legally do that? A federal district court in Fort Wayne, Ind., recently ruled that it cannot  because the punishment violated the girls' First Amendment rights. The legal question of what rights students have to post provocative material on the Internet, and what rights schools have to restrict such postings, is still unsettled. But the Indiana decision is the second important ruling in recent months to strike a blow for students' online speech rights. (See the top 10 people caught on Facebook.) The two Indiana 10th-graders  whose names have not been released  engaged in a variety of crude activities at a slumber party in the summer of 2009. Among other things, they posed with toys in sexually suggestive ways and sucked on phallic-shaped lollipops. It is hardly shocking that teenagers at a sleepover party would engage in raunchy behavior. Thanks to the Internet, however, activity that once remained behind closed bedroom doors can now be broadcast to a limited group of friends  or a worldwide audience. (See top 10 things you shouldn't do on Facebook.) One of the girls posted some of the photos on her MySpace and Facebook accounts, where they could be seen by people who had \\"friend\\" status. Some of the lollipop photos were posted on a photo-sharing website, where a password was necessary to see them. The postings did not identify the girls as students of Churubusco High School, the public school they attended outside of Fort Wayne. Nor did the girls ever take the photographs on campus. But the photos came to the attention of a school parent, who complained to the local superintendent. The parent said the photos were causing divisiveness on the school's volleyball team, of which the two girls were both members, and that the team was breaking down into a camp that supported the photos and one that did not. The principal decided that the girls had violated the school's athletic code, which prohibits students from engaging in conduct that \\"brings discredit or dishonor\\" on themselves or the school. To punish them, he imposed a partial suspension from volleyball. The girls, backed by the American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana, sued, alleging that the suspensions violated their free-speech rights. The school stood its ground, and argued that the girls' provocative posing was not protected free expression. The federal district court took a dim view of the girls' activities. It began its opinion by saying: \\"Not much good takes place at slumber parties for high school kids, and this case proves the point.\\" It also acknowledged that the racy photographs at stake in the case were hardly the loftiest sort of communication. (Read why students have a right to mock teachers online.) In previous school-speech cases, students have fought for the right to wear black armbands to oppose the Vietnam War, or to publish exposés in school newspapers. The expression at issue here, the court said, was by comparison \\"juvenile and silly.\\" Still, it was expression  and worthy of First Amendment protection. Yet the fact that it was judged to be protected speech did not end the matter. In student-speech cases, courts have tried to balance students' rights against schools' need for discipline. The standard they apply, based on the 1969 Supreme Court case Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District (the case involving the black armbands) is that schools can only restrict student expression when that expression would \\"materially and substantially disrupt the work and discipline of the school.\\" The girls' racy photographs, the Indiana court rightly held, do not rise to the level of \\"substantial disruption.\\" The \\"petty disagreements\\" on the volleyball team were \\"utterly routine,\\" the court said, and not the sort of problem that justified infringing on student-speech rights. The Indiana ruling follows a June decision from the Philadelphia-based U.S. Court of Appeals in J.S. v. Blue Mountain School District, which held that a student could not be disciplined for posting a crude parody of her middle-school principal on MySpace. In that case, the court said that even if the parody was offensive  it presented the principal as a bisexual named M-Hoe with a sexual addiction and a child who looked like a gorilla  there was no reason to believe it would cause substantial disruption. Taken together, the back-to-back Indiana and Pennsylvania rulings suggest two things. First, with the rise of the Internet, students are posting a lot of \\"crass foolishness,\\" as the Indiana court tartly put it. And second, that courts are correctly determining that, except in the most extraordinary cases, students have a constitutional right to do so.

Article: Parents whose children think the latest Nike or Adidas shoes may be better than buying old-fashioned plimsolls   because they encourage a healthier style of running, researchers said. Big companies, like Nike and Adidas, make millions of dollars from selling highly-cushioned shoes  both as fashion and sports shoes. The researchers warn that wearing such shoes from an early age can make it difficult to run in a healthy way. Once we have grown used to running in this kind of shoes, it is very difficult to change our technique, even if we remove our shoes, it can raise the risk of injury. Children should be encouraged to wear shoes with thin soles such as plimsolls from a young age to help them develop a natural \\"barefoot\\" running style, experts said. Dr Mick Wilknson, who did the research, told the British Science Festival in Newcastle, \\"If I would advise someone on what to give their child, I would say don't go and buy them expensive Adidas or Nike, just get them a pair of flexible, flat shoes. Give them basic foot-ware, nothing fancy, nothing particularly cushioned.\\" Running in flat shoes, barefoot, encourages the runner to use the front of their foot which is a better technique for running, especially long distances as the human was designed to do. Around the world, and in particular in the US, running barefoot is becoming more and more popular with many long distance runners training without shoes. Dr Mick Wilknson believes that training and running barefoot or in flat running shoes can help reduce injuries to runners, he said: \\"Injury rates in running have not changed since the 1970s, despite claims of improvements in running shoes. That has led some to conclude that barefoot running is better.\\" Question: Why are people advised to wear plimsolls? Options: A: They have a new fashion B: They have better quality.

To be sure you properly maintain your specific make and model of tractor, you should read through the manual that came with it.  Many tractors require specific types of lubricants and hydraulic fluids that you can identify in the manual. Using the wrong kind could damage your tractor. If you do not have a manual for your tractor, you may be able to find the information on the manufacturer's website. Before you get started with any planned maintenance on your tractor, give the whole thing a good once over to see if anything looks overly worn, broken, or dirty. Many newer model tractors even have plastic windows on fluid reservoirs to check things like hydraulic fluid levels.  Give your tractor a visual inspection before and after each use. Make note of any issues you identify to make sure you address them before the next time you use the tractor. Use a tire pressure gauge on each tire and compare it to the tire’s pressure rating written on the sidewall. Tractor tires can last years, but operating a tractor with under-inflated tires can ruin the sidewall and cause the tires to wear faster than they should. Under-inflated tires will also cause the tractor to burn more fuel in normal operations.  You may want to adjust tire pressure for different types of jobs. For instance, if you plan on driving your tractor on the road, you might want to add a few more pounds of air. Reducing tire pressure on slick surfaces like mud can help increase traction. Tires lose pressure more quickly when temperatures change from cold to hot, so you may want to check your tire pressure more frequently in the spring and fall. Some tractors may not be equipped with any lights at all, while others could have an extensive lighting system that includes turn signals and interior lighting. Check each of the lights after each use of the tractor so you can address any electrical issues as they arise.  If a light fails to work, it may be a blown out bulb or fuse that needs to be replaced. If neither of those solve the problem, your tractor may need to be serviced by a technician. Check your owner’s manual to find the correct type of bulb or fuse needed to fix a bad light. Just like in a car, a tractor’s engine relies on a number of rubber hoses and usually at least one belt. Look all of the rubber components over for signs of wear or damage. Excessively worn rubber components should all be replaced.  Look for glazing on the sides and bottom of any belts that may indicate that it’s been slipping. Any rubber that has cracked should be replaced. Depending on the environment you use your tractor in, you may need to change your air filter more or less frequently. Locate the air filter using the tractor’s user manual, then visually inspect it. If it’s really dirty, it should be replaced.  There’s no real rule of thumb with air filters; they should just be replaced as they appear dirty. You should check your air filter after 8 hours of use or so. You need specialized tools to check your tractor’s hydraulic system. If you have the correct coupler fitting and a pressure gauge, you can connect it to any of the black ports on the hydraulic system while it’s running, and compare that figure to the correct specifications outlined in the manual. If you don’t have the correct tools, it’s recommended that you have your hydraulic system serviced by a professional after every 500 hours of use. What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"This article provides a comprehensive guide on how to properly maintain different types of tractors. It emphasizes the importance of reading the tractor's manual for specific requirements and regular visual inspections.

Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.   Which friend was less likely to have a body mass index 30.0 kg/m 2 or greater?  Two friends met after 20 years and compared diets. Paul ate junk food daily and weighed 300 lbs and was 5'8'' in height. Mike was vegan and stayed healthy and thin.  Hint: Any unused energy in food, whether it comes from carbohydrates, proteins, or lipids, is stored in the body as fat. An extra 3,500 Calories of energy results in the storage of almost half a kilogram (1 pound) of stored body fat. People who consistently consume more food energy then they need may become obese. Obesity occurs when the body mass index is 30.0 kg/m 2 or greater. Body mass index (BMI) is an estimate of the fat content of the body. It is calculated by dividing a person’s weight (in kilograms) by the square of the person’s height (in meters). Obesity increases the risk of health problems such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension. A:","output":"Mike was less likely to have a body mass index of 30.0 kg/m2 or greater. The paragraph mentions that Paul ate junk food daily and weighed 300 lbs, while Mike was vegan and stayed healthy and thin. Considering that eating excessive food (especially junk food: high in calories and fats) regularly leads to obesity (indicated by a body mass index of 30.0 kg/m2 or greater), Paul is more likely to have a greater body mass index. Also, the fact that Mike is described as thin and healthy (typically associated with a balanced diet) suggests that he is less likely to have a high body mass index indicating obesity.  So based on the information provided, Mike is less likely to be obese, hence less likely to have a body mass index 30.0 kg/m2 or greater."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Shad are also valued as a sport fish that exhibit complex and little-understood feeding behavior while spawning. Unlike salmon, shad retain the ability to digest and assimilate food during the anadromous migration. Like other fish, their feeding instinct can be triggered by a variety of factors such as turbidity and water temperature. Anglers use both spinning and fly fishing tackle to pursue shad. Spin fisherman use a shad dartjig or a flutter spoon. Some anglers use a downrigger to place the artificial lure at the desired depth and location. This is usually in the channel, or deepest part of the river. Migrating shad tend to occupy the lower portion of the water column which makes this the typical depth of choice for fishing. In the North, April through June is when shad spawn in coastal rivers and estuaries once water temperatures have reached 58 degrees Fahrenheit (14 °C). Fishing conditions typically improve as water temperatures warm and flow decreases.  Jeff loves to go shad fishing. He prefers using fly fishing tackle and is planning a fishing trip up North with his buddies. They decided to take their trip in May when everyone can get off work over the Memorial Day holiday. Sam enjoys shad fishing as well, but the only time he and his buddies are able to take off work is during their slow season in March.  Who will have worse fishing conditions and likely catch less shad on their fishing trip, Jeff or Sam? A:","output":"To determine who will have worse fishing conditions and likely catch less shad on their fishing trip, we need to compare the factors mentioned in the text that affect shad feeding behavior and the timing of Jeff's and Sam's trips. 1. Season: The text states that shad spawn in the North from April through June, once water temperatures have reached 58°F (14°C). Jeff is planning his trip in May, which falls within the shad spawning season. Sam, however, is planning his trip in March, which is before the prime shad spawning season. 2. Water temperature: Optimal fishing conditions reportedly occur as water temperatures warm. Jeff's trip in May will likely experience warmer water temperatures than Sam's trip in March. 3. Water flow: Fishing conditions typically improve as water flow decreases. Without knowing the specific water flow conditions during their respective trips, we cannot comment on this factor. Based on the available information, Sam will have worse fishing conditions and likely catch less shad on his fishing trip because his trip is outside the optimal shad spawning season and likely to experience colder water temperatures than Jeff's."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Rivers play an essential role in the process of weathering and erosion of rocks, which ultimately contributes to the formation of soil. When a river flows over rocks, it erodes the rocks through various mechanical and chemical processes. The mechanical processes include abrasion, where the force of the water and sediments carried by the river scrape away at the rock surfaces, causing them to break down. The chemical processes include dissolution, where certain minerals within the rocks are dissolved by the water and absorbed into the river.  Over time, these processes gradually wear down the rocks into smaller and smaller pieces, producing sediments such as sand, silt, and clay particles. These sediments are then transported by the river and deposited downstream along the riverbank, floodplains, or at the mouth of the river, forming new landforms such as deltas and alluvial fans. As organic matter from plants and decomposed organisms mixes with these sediments, they eventually form soil layers that support plant growth and provide habitats for various living organisms. In summary, rivers erode rocks and contribute to the formation of soil by breaking down rocks through mechanical and chemical processes and depositing the resulting sediments downstream."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Believes the 2003 invasion of the country was a 'political cock-up' Says the people of Iraq are not better off since the war in the country. Warns against UK forces going back into the country again. Major General led Royal Marines during the 1982 Falklands War.","output":"Title: \\"Major General Holds UK Politicians Accountable for Iraq's 'Complete Mess'\\" Major General, who led the Royal Marines during the 1982 Falklands War, delivered a harsh criticism of UK politicians regarding the ongoing Iraq crisis. In a recent statement, the veteran military figure openly blamed British political actions for the 'complete mess' in the Middle Eastern country, creating quite a stir in political and military circles alike. The Major General’s powerful assessment comes in the wake of continuing turmoil in Iraq; years of violence and instability that he attributes directly to the 2003 invasion of Iraq under the initiative of the US-UK alliance. He termed the fateful expedition as a 'political cock-up,' suggesting that it was a grave error instigated by political, rather than strategic, considerations. The Major General questioned the effectiveness of the war in improving the quality of life for the people of Iraq. He constructed a fairly damning critique of the UK government's actions, arguing that the Iraqi citizens are not better off since the intervention. The war, which was supposed to bestow democracy and stabilize the region, has - in his view - yielded a legacy of unrest and sectarian violence, further exacerbating the citizens' plight.  Continuing his critique of British foreign policy, the Major General warned against the possibility of UK forces re-engaging military action in Iraq. Reflecting on the repercussions of the past intervention, and the warfare's rather disastrous consequences, he strongly discourages further involvement. His admonition to his country is clear: there should be no re-entry of UK troops into Iraq. The Major General, famed for his leadership of the Royal Marines in the 1982 Falklands War, brings a wealth of battlefield experience and understanding to his critique. His leadership during the Falklands conflict, which saw the UK effectively repel Argentine forces from the south Atlantic islands, earned him considerable respect within military and political circles. Thus, his scathing review of the Iraq intervention carries considerable weight. His comments have sparked a much-needed conversation in both defence and political corridors in the UK. Civilian and military leaders alike are now evaluating the UK's past actions in Iraq and contemplating future strategies, his cautionary words resonating deeply.  In conclusion, the Major General's critique is indicative of wider frustration within military circles over perceived political decisions that have had significant strategic implications. His frank blame on the UK politicians for the missteps in Iraq voices a strong discontent with how foreign interference - however well-intentioned - can result in further despair, destabilization, and long-term suffering. This stark assessment serves as a reminder that the mission and consequences of intervention should always be thought through thoroughly to avoid further 'political cock-ups.'  Amidst global geopolitical complexities, the Major General's candid observations underscore the imperative need to balance political objectives with ground realities. His words thus ring as a cautionary bell, alerting leaders about potential pitfalls of decisions before they turn into historical regrets."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Danger: A study found pregnant women who take antibiotics could be tampering with their child's immune system. Pregnant women who take antibiotics could be putting their unborn children at risk of disease. Researchers have found that drugs used to beat infections can interfere with a baby’s immune system. By contrast mothers can help to kick-start a child’s ability to avoid illness by passing on certain germs. A study by the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia in the US showed that bacteria in the gut play a crucial role in fostering the rapid production of infection-fighting white blood cells. They found that, as with humans, mice have a surge of white blood cells around birth, but this response is reduced when their mothers are exposed to antibiotics. This left the creatures much more vulnerable to deadly E. coli infections, especially when they were born prematurely. The researchers showed that signalling mechanisms within the gut’s vast colony of micro-organisms regulate the production of white blood cells in baby mice. Exposing both the mothers and babies to antibiotics reduced the diversity of gut bacteria, many of which are beneficial, and also impaired resistance to infection in the newborn. Critically ill babies are often treated with antibiotics as a precaution, without proof of infection. The study appeared in the journal Nature Medicine. Hitesh Deshmukh, first author of the study, said: 'At birth, newborns move from a largely sterile environment to one full of microorganisms. 'Animals and humans adapt to this new situation by ramping up the production of granulocytes within the first days of life.' Doctors advised unborn babies benefit from bacteria which builds up their strength, rather than medication. A similar procedure in humans, called a fecal transplant, has recently been successful in treating severe bacterial infection in adults. However, such transplants have not been performed in newborns, and the scientists warn that a lot more research is needed before they can determine what implications these animal results may have in guiding human treatment. Despite the findings, babies will continue to be treated with antibiotics as it is very difficult to determine whether newborns are infected with bacteria. But the research urged clinicians to strive to decrease antibiotic use as a long-term goal. Highlights:","output":"1. Pregnant women taking antibiotics might affect their baby's immune system. 2. Medicine can interfere with a baby's ability to fight infections. 3. Bacteria in the gut helps produce infection-fighting white blood cells. 4. Babies should benefit from good bacteria instead of medication. 5. Researchers want to decrease antibiotic use as a long-term goal."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(CNN) -- All eyes will be on Lionel Messi and Arjen Robben when Argentina face the Netherlands in the World Cup semifinal in Sao Paulo to discover who will meet Germany in the final. The Dutch will be looking to their mercurial winger to steer them to a second successive World Cup final while Argentina will likely need some Messi magic if they are to reach a first final in 24 years. Both men have been central to the success of their sides so far in the competition earning glowing tributes from team managers past and present.

Article: Tiny monitoring devices have become an increasingly common way for scientists to study elusive animals that are difficult to track on a day-to-day basis. However, now it seems that smart. seals have caught on to the trick and are using it to their advantage to catch fish! To find out if that is true, a team of researchers from the University of St. Andrews in Scotland selected a group often young grey seals that had neither encountered the ocean nor been exposed to any kind of acoustic tags. The researchers then placed the seals one at a time, inside a pool that contained 20 foraging boxes, only two of which housed fish -- one with tags and the other without. Each seal was allowed to explore the boxes twenty separate times. In order to ensure that mammal was not depending on its memory, the fish were moved to different boxes each time. At first, there was no difference in the amount of time it took the seals to discover the tagged and untagged fish. However, after they had been in the pool a few times, they started locating the tagged fish much faster. To confirm that this indeed was the case, there searchers conducted a second experiment using two boxes -- one with pieces of fish and the other with just acoustic tags. Sure enough, the seals were all attracted to the one that was sending out signals. While this experiment involved only seals, the researchers believe that other marine mammals may also be using the information to catch prey. Sadly, predators like sharks that have been tagged by scientists may be negatively affected, as pings they emit could warn their prey of their presence. Besides potentially messing up nature's food chain, the \\"dinner bell\\" effect of the acoustic tags could also mean that the conclusions reached by previous fish studies may not be correct. Now that the secret is out, scientists will have to come up with another way to conduct their studies -- one that is not detectable by the crafty marine animals. Question: The researchers seem to believe that sharks tagged by scientists   _  . - may benefit from the tags - may attract seals by mistake - may find it hard to find prey - may be annoyed by the emitted pings Answer:","output":"The researchers seem to believe that sharks tagged by scientists may find it hard to find prey."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Meanwhile, Su-kyoung is panicking alone in the operating room. She sees a frightening image of a girl in a dark blue dress and long dark hair. Yoon-hee begins the surgery, telling Su-kyoung that it is time to become pretty. A day later, on Hyeon-su's birthday, she argues with her mother about where to have the party and finally decides to do it in her home. Hyeon-su is later in her art class, making a sculpture of Su-kyoung's face. Many girls in the class comment saying that Su-kyoung looks much more attractive than she did before. Hyeon-su accidentally cuts into the face of her sculpture and a large cut subsequently appears on Su-kyoung's cheek. She screams and flees in terror. A mysterious voice shrieks at her saying she wants her face back. Su-kyoung's cut and blood later vanish. Hye-won, another friend, decides to get an eye job from Yoon-hee. Meanwhile, Hyeon-su, Jae-hui and Su-kyoung wait at a bus stop while an old woman gives out fliers for her missing granddaughter. Su-kyoung is distant, troubled by earlier events. The bus arrives but Hyeon-su waits for her friend Sung-eon to come. Jae-hui shows instant dislike for Sung-eon, who is tomboyish and closer to Hyeon-su than her other friends: she also hasn't undergone plastic surgery. The girls all celebrate Hyeon-su's party and Su-kyoung gives her an expensive doll for a present.

Read the text and determine if the sentence is true (see options at the end): Hideki Kamiya (神谷 英樹 , Kamiya Hideki , born December 19, 1970) is a video game designer and director working for PlatinumGames. Kamiya was formerly employed by Capcom and Clover Studio, and founded PlatinumGames in 2006, along with other former Capcom staff. Sentence: Hideki Kamiya was born more than 20075 days ago. Select from the following. A). Yes B). It's impossible to say C). No","output":"Okay, let's figure this out together! Hideki Kamiya was born on December 19, 1970. To find out if he was born more than 20,075 days ago, we need to count the days between his birthday and now. As of September 29, 2022, that would make Hideki Kamiya 51 years, 9 months, and 10 days old. A year has 365 days, and in 51 years, there would be 51 multiplied by 365, which is 18615 days. Then, there are 9 months. Let's count the days in these months:  January has 31 days, February usually has 28 days (but every 4 years has 29 for leap year), March has 31 days, April has 30 days, May has 31 days, June has 30 days, July has 31 days, August has 31 days, and September has about 29 days (since we're reaching the end of the month). Adding up the days in these months, we have 31+28+31+30+31+30+31+31+29 = 272 days. But we also need to add days for leap years. From 1970 to 2022, we have 13 leap years, so that adds 13 more days. Now, let's count the 10 days of the current month, which is September. So far, we've counted 18615 (days from years) + 272 (days from months) + 13 (days from leap years) + 10 (days of the current month) = 18,910 days. Now, let's compare this to 20,075 days in the sentence: 18,910 days < 20,075 days Since 18,910 is less than 20,075, we can say that Hideki Kamiya was born less than 20,075 days ago.

Given those answer options, answer the question: If I tell you that Igneous intrusion creates valuable products, and ask you the question \\"what does igneous intrusion create?\\", is the correct answer \\"adding heat\\"? A:","output":"No, the correct answer is not \\"adding heat.\\" Instead, the correct answer is that igneous intrusion creates valuable geological products, often in the form of intrusive igneous rocks and economically important minerals. An igneous intrusion occurs when molten rock, known as magma, rises up from the mantle or lower crust and invades pre-existing rock layers in the Earth's crust. This process can lead to the formation of valuable geological products such as intrusive igneous rocks and mineral deposits. Intrusive igneous rocks, like granite and diorite, form as the magma cools and crystallizes slowly beneath the Earth's surface, resulting in coarse-grained rock textures. These rocks can be quarried for construction and decorative purposes. Additionally, igneous intrusions can lead to the formation of mineral deposits. As magma solidifies, it can concentrate certain elements to form rich deposits of valuable minerals, such as copper, gold, and platinum. These are often found near or within the intrusive rocks and are essential for many industrial and manufacturing applications. Overall, while adding heat is a factor in the process of igneous intrusion, it is not the correct answer to the question \\"what does igneous intrusion create?\\" Instead, the answer should focus on the geological products generated by the intrusion, such as intrusive igneous rocks and economically important minerals."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Having read the above passage, choose the right answer to the following question (choices are the hottest or the coldest ):   Rachel was looking into the night sky. The darkest star is most likely: the hottest or the coldest? Answer:","output":"The darkest star is most likely the coldest. To understand why, let's examine the relationship between a star's temperature and its brightness. Main sequence stars can be classified based on their temperature, which in turn affects their color and brightness. The temperature of a star dictates the color it emits, following the principle of blackbody radiation.  The colors of main sequence stars follow a progression from the hottest to the coldest, which can be remembered by the mnemonic \\"Oh Be A Fine Girl/Guy, Kiss Me!\\" This corresponds to the stellar classes O, B, A, F, G, K, and M, with O-class stars being the hottest and M-class stars being the coldest. The temperature of O-class stars can exceed 30,000 Kelvin, whereas M-class stars may have temperatures as low as 2,400 Kelvin.  Now, considering the Stefan-Boltzmann Law, which states that the total energy emitted by a blackbody is proportional to the fourth power of its temperature, we can infer that hotter stars emit more energy (or are brighter) compared to colder stars. To put it simply, a star's brightness increases as its temperature increases.  Given the passage's statement that \\"the hotter a main sequence star is, the brighter it is,\\" we can conclude that the darkest star (i.e., the least bright) observed by Rachel in the night sky would most likely be the coldest star among the visible stars."},{"instruction":"Combine facts and answer this: Phil Joanou and Rick Ray, are of which nationality?

Backers of Legal Aid services for the poor are pushing a measure that would increase court filing fees in Kentucky to raise money for the program, which faces steep funding cuts. The proposed bill, sponsored by Rep. Charles Geveden, D-Wickliffe, would double the portion of the fee that goes to Legal Aid -- in district court to 10 from 5 and in circuit court to 20 from 10. Kentucky's current fee for filing a case in district court is 50.50, and in circuit court 108. The increase still would leave Kentucky's filing fee costs below those of surrounding states and would raise about 1.3 million a year -- almost enough to replace what Legal Aid is losing from federal and other sources, said Jamie Hamon, executive director of the Access to Justice Foundation, a state poverty law resource center in Lexington. Geveden said his measure appears to be the only potential source of money for the program, which is being forced to lay off workers and close offices around the state. Geveden said he's concerned because federal funding hasn't increased in recent years, and states with increased poverty are taking a greater share of the money. ''If you don't come up with the money somewhere, legal services to people in need will diminish or go away,'' he said. Hamon said the proposed bill has attracted a number of co-sponsors, and Legal Aid backers are hoping to get it passed in the upcoming legislative session. Hamon said she knows fee increases aren't popular with lawmakers but hopes they realize the crisis Legal Aid is facing. ''A lot of poor people are not going to get served,'' she said. The measure has the endorsement of the Kentucky Bar Association. The association's board of governors voted unanimously last month to back the bill, said KBA President Stephen Catron, a Bowling Green lawyer. Legal Aid ''has been a godsend to a great number of people in this state,'' Catron said. ''We simply must find a way to provide those services to the public.'' Larry York, executive director of Appalachian Regional Defense Fund, which provides Legal Aid services in 37 Eastern Kentucky counties and is a KBA board member, said he hopes the measure is approved.

What is the solution?","output":"To solve the equation -162*f = 3*f - 1320 for f, we need to follow these steps: Step 1: Combine the 'f' terms on one side of the equation. To do this, we add 162*f to both sides of the equation: -162*f + 162*f = 3*f - 1320 + 162*f This simplifies to: 0 = 165*f - 1320 Step 2: Isolate the 'f' term. Now, we need to isolate the 'f' term by adding 1320 to both sides of the equation: 0 + 1320 = 165*f - 1320 + 1320 This simplifies to: 1320 = 165*f Step 3: Solve for 'f'. To find the value of 'f', we need to divide both sides of the equation by 165: 1320 / 165 = 165*f / 165 This simplifies to: 8 = f The solution to the equation -162*f = 3*f - 1320 is f = 8."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

According to Callen, Warner Bros has cited budgetary constraints as the reason for this exclusion, raising eyebrows in the movie industry. The first two installments of the Hobbit series reeled in a mammoth 1 billion and 958 million respectively, leading many to question the entertainment giant's justifications for this decision.

Clark kennels the Malamute with the station's sled dogs; it soon metamorphoses and attacks them. When he hears the commotion, MacReady pulls the fire alarm, and Childs incinerates the creature. Blair performs another autopsy which leads him to believe the creature perfectly imitates other organisms. The Norwegians' records lead the Americans to a buried flying saucer that the station's geologist, Norris, hypothesizes is likely over 100,000 years old. Blair becomes increasingly paranoid and withdraws, calculating that if the alien escapes to a civilized area, all life on Earth will be assimilated within a few years. Fuchs tells MacReady that he is worried about Blair, and according to Blair's journal, the creature's \\"dead\\" remains are still active on a cellular level. The camp enacts safety measures designed to reduce risk of assimilation. The creature assimilates Bennings, but Windows catches him outside before his metamorphosis is complete and MacReady burns the creature before it can escape. They discover Blair has wrecked all the transports and killed the remaining sled dogs. The team corners Blair as he is destroying the radio and locks him in an isolated tool shed.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Background: Almost all earthquakes occur at plate boundaries. All types of plate boundaries have earthquakes. Convection within the Earth causes the plates to move. As the plates move, stresses build. When the stresses build too much, the rocks break. The break releases the energy that was stored in the rocks. The sudden release of energy is an earthquake. During an earthquake the rocks usually move several centimeters. Rarely, they may move as much as a few meters. Elastic rebound theory describes how earthquakes occur ( Figure below ).  Paragraph: Tim the seismologist studied data from two cities: Tokyo and Kansas City. Tokyo experienced many more earthquakes than Kansas City.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which city experiences more energy release because of rocks breaking? Answer:","output":"Based on the provided information, Tokyo experiences more energy release because of rocks breaking. This conclusion is derived from the fact that Tokyo experiences significantly more earthquakes than Kansas City, and the energy released during each earthquake is a result of rocks breaking. Since Tokyo undergoes more earthquakes, more instances of rocks breaking and releasing energy occur in comparison to Kansas City."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The best way to iron clothes quickly is to place a piece of aluminum foil underneath the ironing board cover. This helps because the foil reflects the heat from the iron back onto the clothes, so you are effectively ironing both sides at once. This saves time and energy. The other option, using newspaper, will not work as well because newspaper does not reflect heat the same way foil does.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: Who appears to come out in support of the current vice-president via videotape? ?  Mays Gilliam is the alderman for the 9th Ward in Washington, D.C.. After learning he is likely to lose his job and getting dumped by his girlfriend, Kim, Gilliam is surprisingly chosen as the party candidate for the presidency after his party's original presidential and vice-presidential nominees die in a plane crash and he is lauded as a hero for saving a woman from an explosion. Assuming the election was already lost to sitting vice-president Brian Lewis, the party decided to pick a likable but unwinnable minority candidate to improve their chances in the next presidential election. At first, Gilliam feels he will not be able to succeed as President because he would be representing the entire African-American populace, and does not want to do anything to mess it up. However, Gilliam begins to rise in the polls after his brother persuades him to speak out for what he believes. He begins to talk about issues such as welfare, money, society, etc. After Lewis runs a series of attack ads including one saying Gilliam supports cancer, Gilliam begins to fight back using what he claimed was \\"kissing\\" his opponent (taken from Bugs Bunny–Elmer Fudd cartoons). A part of this strategy includes dubbing a videotape of Osama bin Laden saying he hates America but loves Brian Lewis. This strategy gains Gilliam even more points in the polls. As voting day draws closer, Gilliam eventually learns the reason why he was chosen as the party candidate, fires some disloyal campaign operatives (although they reconciled with him afterwards), and chooses his brother as his running mate. He later has a debate with his opponent in which he manages to win the crowd over by speaking truth about the American life. Finally, Gilliam ends up winning the election and the presidency. The film ends with a shot of Mount Rushmore with Mays Gilliam's head added, complete with bling.","output":"In the article, Osama bin Laden appears to come out in support of the current Vice-President Brian Lewis via videotape.

Concernant la politique internationale, le Groupe asiatique et la Chine accordaient une attention croissante à la coopération régionale dans le domaine de l'investissement, à la fois dans un contexte Sud-Sud et avec des pays plus développés tels que le Japon et la République de Corée. Translate to English.","output":"Regarding international politics, the Asian Group and China have been increasingly focusing on regional cooperation in the field of investment, both in a South-South context and with more developed countries such as Japan and the Republic of Korea. In recent years, we have seen a growing emphasis on regional cooperation within the international political landscape, particularly among the Asian Group and China. This interest in collaboration extends not only to investment within the South-South context (which refers to the exchange of resources, technology, and knowledge between developing countries) but also to partnering with more developed nations such as Japan and the Republic of Korea. The growth of regional cooperation in the field of investment can be attributed to several factors, including the need for economic diversification, a desire for improved regional stability, and the potential for leveraging the unique advantages that each country offers. Economic diversification is a crucial goal for many developing countries, as it can help them reduce their reliance on a single industry or sector and minimize the risk of economic shocks. By fostering regional cooperation, countries can, for example, pool their financial resources and expertise to develop strategic investments in sectors such as infrastructure, energy, and technology. This, in turn, can lead to stronger and more sustainable regional growth and development. Another driver towards increased regional cooperation is the desire for improved stability within the region. Political and economic stability is a vital factor for attracting foreign investment. By working together on shared goals and interests, countries within the Asian Group can help to reduce fractious disputes that could threaten the stable investment environment they seek to create. Additionally, this cooperation can lead to more effective and unified responses to common challenges such as climate change, terrorism, and economic inequality. Lastly, regional cooperation allows countries to leverage the unique and complementary advantages that each nation has to offer. For example, countries with a wealth of natural resources can collaborate with nations that possess advanced technological capabilities to develop those resources more efficiently and sustainably. Combining the strengths of multiple countries can lead to greater regional competitiveness on the global stage and open new opportunities for economic growth and development. In conclusion, the Asian Group and China's increasing focus on regional cooperation in the field of investment showcases the potential benefits that can be achieved from such collaborations. By pooling resources, promoting stability, and leveraging each other's strengths, these countries can work together to create a more prosperous, sustainable, and competitive regional economy."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Given the question \\"How would you describe Addison?\\", is \\"hapy for Addison's uncle\\" a valid answer? Answer:","output":"No, \\"happy for Addison's uncle\\" is not a valid answer.  Justifying the steps taken: 1. The question asks us to describe Addison, meaning we should offer traits, characteristics or behaviors about Addison, not someone else. \\"Happy for Addison's uncle\\" is not about Addison, but about another person's emotional state towards Addison's actions.     2. Even though it's mentioned that Addison visits their uncle's farm every summer to help out, this information tells us about Addison's actions, not necessarily Addison's emotional state, character or personality traits.  3. To validly describe Addison, we could use information such as 'helpful', 'dedicated', or 'family-oriented', based on the action of them visiting and helping out at the farm every summer.  Hence, it's clear that \\"happy for Addison's uncle\\" is not a valid answer to the question \\"How would you describe Addison?\\" because it describes someone else's emotions, not Addison's characteristics or personality traits."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write some highlights for the following article: On a recent flight from Atlanta, I was delayed on the tarmac for an hour and a half. The woman seated behind me played two Adele songs on a loop on her iPad. On speaker. For an hour. No one said anything. At one point the woman took a call. \\"I'm on the plane,\\" I heard her tell the caller. \\"It's Adele on my iPad!\\" Then, \\"I don't have headphones. But everyone likes Adele!\\" Anyone who has ever been on a plane, and is over the age of 10, has probably experienced some form of air rage. Creating it, witnessing it or just making a supreme mental effort not to succumb to it by thumping your seatmate for an outrageous offense such as playing loud music, noisily speaking on the phone or eating food so stinky it might actually be considered a weapon. The good news: you're not alone. The bad news: air rage is becoming routine. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) saw a 29% rise in incidents on board flights between 2009 and 2010. The Transportation Security Administration, however, has seen a decline over the last three years in security-related disturbances the agency has been called to deal with on planes. Air rage: Passengers 'quicker to snap' However you slice it, you don't have to work too hard to notice multiple recent examples of passengers losing their cool in lavish fashion. This year alone we've seen some impressive displays of in-flight fury. January started with an unruly passenger aboard a Reykjavik to New York flight who finished his journey rather inelegantly duct-taped to a seat after an apparent display of screaming, hitting and spitting at fellow passengers. Later that month, a Jetblue flight from New York to San Diego made an unscheduled stop in Denver to remove a woman who allegedly became verbally abusive after another passenger was moved to a neighboring \\"even more legroom\\" seat near her. The source of the woman's rage was apparently that the man had not paid for the extra legroom (65), but had been moved there due to a broken television in his seat. In February, a male passenger on a flight to Atlanta is accused of hitting another passenger's crying baby, uttering a racial slur as he did so. Man accused of slapping toddler will plead not guilty. According to an FBI affidavit, a passenger on a February Hawaiian airlines flight from New York assaulted a flight attendant, spat food at people and bit an air marshal. And another February incident proved that you don't even have to be up in the air to experience air travel-related anger. Yan Linkun, identified by NBC News as an executive and Chinese Communist Party official, became incensed at Kunming Changshui International Airport in Kunming, China. Learning he'd missed not one but two flights, Linkun vented his rage by flinging equipment and smashing windows in an impressive tirade that has since gone viral. Airline squeeze: It's not you, it's the seat. Frustrations on the ground and in the air may seem to invite air rage. Before fliers even reach their allocated metal bird, they've often struggled through security and customs lines and may face delays at the gate or on board. And the United States' recent mandatory government spending cuts could make those slowdowns at airports worse. Airlines, angling to make a profit, are chipping away at legroom or charging extra for a little more room, introducing new fees or bundling and unbundling the existing charges and re-jiggering mileage programs to favor the elite big-spenders. Travelers take aim at kids on a plane. Air travelers are agitated, but it doesn't quite explain why some boil over on planes. Is the altitude getting to them? HLN's Dr. Drew Pinsky points out that fliers can experience mild brain swelling even at low altitudes that can make it harder to keep your cool. Or are enraged passengers just under the influence? \\"If you want to look at one single contributing factor, you would have to point at alcohol,\\" Dr. Drew says. Andrew Thomson, creator of airrage.org and author of several air-travel related books including \\"Air Rage: Crisis in the Skies,\\" agrees. \\"Alcohol,\\" he writes, \\"is the leading driver of air rage.\\" In fact, many of the air rage incidents above were allegedly alcohol-related. Fortunately, no one on my flight was outwardly enraged or inebriated, though I'm sure, like me, many passengers were entertaining extravagant fantasies of how they'd deal with that offending Adele fan and her iPad. What in-flight behaviors push you to the verge of an outburst? Share your stories below.","output":"- On an Atlanta flight, a woman played Adele songs on loop on her iPad for an hour, causing a disturbance to other passengers. - The International Air Transport Association reported a 29% increase in on-board incidents between 2009 and 2010. - Several examples of air rage have occurred in recent years, such as a passenger being duct-taped to a seat and another smashing windows at an airport. - Airline policies such as reduced legroom and additional fees may contribute to frustrations among travelers. - Alcohol is cited as a leading cause of air rage by experts like Dr. Drew Pinsky and Andrew Thomson."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Johnnie had a set of small volumes of English verse, extensively annotated by his own hand, which Stoddard had brought to her early in their acquaintance, leaving it with her more as a gift than as a loan.  She kept these little books after all the others had gone back.  She had read and reread them--cullings from Chaucer, from Spenser, from the Elizabethan lyrists, the border balladry, fierce, tender, oh, so human--till she knew pages of them by heart, and their vocabulary influenced her own, their imagery tinged all her leisure thoughts.  It seemed to her, whenever she debated returning them, that she could not bear it.  She would get them out and sit with one of them open in her hands, not reading, but staring at the pages with unseeing eyes, passing her fingers over it, as one strokes a beloved hand, or turning through each book only to find the pencilled words in the margins.  She would be giving up part of herself when she took these back.  Yet it had to be done, and one miserable morning she made them all into a neat package, intending to carry them to the mill and place them on Stoddard's desk thus early, when nobody would be in the office.  Then the children came in; Deanie was half sick; and in the distress of getting the ailing child comfortably into her own bed, Johnnie forgot the books.  Taking them in at noon, she met Stoddard himself.  Question: \\"Whose books did Johnnie keep and reread?\\" Response: \\"Stoddard\\" Available choices:  (A). no.  (B). yes.

Question: Pick the option in line with common sense to answer the question. Question: The student felt bad for his failure, he no longer felt what? Options:  A. he felt like he lost control  B. choice  C. worthy  D. excellent  E. honest Answer:","output":"C. worthy In light of the given information, it would be most reasonable to infer that the student no longer felt worthy after experiencing failure. Failing can lead to a decline in self-esteem and self-worth, often causing individuals to doubt their capabilities and value. As a result, the student might have been feeling unworthy of success or recognition. Option A - \\"he felt like he lost control\\" could be a plausible answer, as sometimes individuals feel that they have lost control over their abilities or circumstances after experiencing failure. However, this choice is less directly connected to the emotional implications of feeling bad after failing, which makes option C a better fit. Option B - \\"choice\\" is not a relevant or clear response to the question. It does not offer any meaningful insight into how the student might be feeling. Option D - \\"excellent\\" can be ruled out since it's the opposite of feeling bad. If the student felt bad for his failure, it is unlikely that he would feel excellent about it. Option E - \\"honest\\" is not directly related to feeling bad for failing. It's possible that failure might cause someone to doubt their honesty to themselves or wonder if they misrepresented their abilities, but this option doesn't directly address the emotional consequence of failing. Therefore, the most appropriate answer in line with common sense is option C. The student no longer felt worthy after experiencing failure, which is a common emotional reaction to such setbacks."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Title: Still Crazy Movie plot: \\"History teaches us that men behave wisely . . . once they've exhausted all other alternatives. For most rock bands, the pursuit of wisdom's a low priority compared to fame, fortune and fornication. Such a band was Strange Fruit.\\" Thus begins the opening dialog of Hughie, (Billy Connolly) as he launches into a brief history of the British band: in the late 1970's Strange Fruit, consisting of guitarist Brian Lovell (Bruce Robinson), his brother and lead singer Keith, keyboard player Tony Costello (Stephen Rea), bassist Les Wickes (Jimmy Nail) and drummer Beano Baggot (Timothy Spall) were HUGE. When Keith died of a drug overdose, he was replaced on vocals by Ray Simms (Bill Nighy). Watched over by road-dog Hughie and Girl Friday Karen (Juliet Aubrey), they soldiered on until the disastrous appearance at the open-air Wisbech (U.K.) Rock Festival, when lightning struck the stage during their opening number. The already-contentious band members decided it was a sign and immediately broke up forever (all this in the first five minutes of the film). Forever, that is, until in the present (OK, 1998) Tony is spotted on Ibeza (he now stocks condoms in the restrooms at the resorts there) by the son of the Wisbech promoter, who wants to put together a 20th anniversary reunion concert with all the original acts. Tony seeks out Karen, now a divorced mother who coordinates conferences for a major hotel, suggesting a possible reunion. She is ambivalent, as is Les (now a successful roofer with a family) and Ray (a struggling solo artist with a demanding second wife -- Swedish -- and a mansion he can't afford). Beano, working in a floral nursery and hounded by the Inland Revenue (the U.K.'s IRS) is the only immediately enthusiastic bandmate. They arrange a meeting, where Karen informs them that she's tracked Brian and found his music royalties are being distributed per a bequest in his will, provoking Beano to compassionately ask if that means \\"the silly sod's dead?\\" The band again soldiers on.

He cocked his head. “What do you mean?” I had no idea—on a conscious level—what I was asking for, just that I felt in a desperate sense that the self I knew was slipping away. An inability to recognize myself either in my writing or in reflecting upon my own actions was taking over. And then…? I didn't care. I wanted to kiss girls. Which is fine—just not something I ordinarily do. I wanted to drink, smoke. Again, fine—but not something I ordinarily do. “Do I seem…okay?” I asked a colleague at work. A woman I barely knew. Insanely, I thought that since she worked with disabled students, many of whom struggled with mental illness, she would know mania when she saw it. This was a rather foolish assumption—especially since she's an educator, not a psychiatrist, especially with how skilled I am at wearing the mask of calm, the face of sanity. “You seem great, Julie. Cheery. Professional as always.” I let her reassurance placate me. Wanted to be placated. Yet, within months I lost my job. And not only that, but a chance at a scholarship, two really important long term friendships—relationships I'd enjoyed since high school. I was hospitalized three times between September and February. I lost my ability to trust myself, lost my mind. It is now a little over two years since I first felt that sliding. Twenty-six months since I knew that somewhere in the deepest parts of who I am, I was slipping. Nine seasons since I begged Dr. Poe, “Remember me to myself!” I'm still recuperating. Yes.

Please answer the following question: Build a movie plot around this: Who went with Kirwill to retrieve second head? Renko A:","output":"Movie Title: \\"Renko and Kirwill: The Second Head\\" Movie Plot: 1. Initial Plot: Our story begins in a small, quiet town in Russia \\"Rostov\\". Here, Senior cop, Arkady Renko (a Russian) and James Kirwill (an American), become unlikely partners after an international murder mystery connects their paths. The mystery revolves around a grotesque series of murders where the victims' second head has been taken as trophies. 2. First Act: Renko, known for his robust ingenuity, cynicism, and inherent charm, is paired with Kirwill who, in contrast, is characterized by his intuitive mind and stubborn, brash American spirit. The tension between them is initially palpable, given the cold war ambiance and their contrasting personalities. Despite this, they resolve to find the second head from a crime scene which leads them through a proverbial maze of deceit, corruption, and violence. 3. Midpoint: The case leads them to a reclusive ex-cosmonaut, Ivan. Ivan confesses to being blackmailed into relinquishing his research on human cloning, hinting towards why the murderer may be taking the victims' heads.  4. Climax:  As Renko and Kirwill dig deeper, they discover the gruesome reality - the murderer, a disgraced scientist named Dolokhov, is adopting Ivan's research to conduct unsuccessful cloning experiments resulting in the grotesque second heads. He was using them as means to perfect his cloning technique.  5. Final Resolution:  Underneath the cover of the Russian winter, the pair infiltrates Dolokhov's hidden laboratory. Kirwill skillfully distracts Dolokhov, providing Renko with the opportunity to retrieve the second head as evidence. After a deadly battle, Dolokhov is defeated, and Renko and Kirwill, having put their differences aside, hand over the evidence to the authorities. 6. Epilogue:  The bond of respect and understanding that forms between Renko and Kirwill bridged the gap between two nations and their ideologies. Our story ends with the pair standing victorious, showcasing their triumph not only over the criminal but the cold war sentiments as well. In summary, Renko went with Kirwill on a quest filled with mystery, danger, and unusual twists to retrieve the second head, forming the basis of our dramatic and thrilling story. The shared experience allowed them to form a bond of trust, respect, and understanding, bridging their initial cultural and ideological differences. Steps: 1. Setting initial plot around the main characters 2. Developing the characters' personalities 3. Introducing the mystery element and the antagonist 4. Planning the climax with an action scene 5. Resolving the main plot issue and tying loose ends 6. Building the epilogue and summarizing the story This sequence allows for an organically developed plot which introduced our main characters, unfolded their personality charms, built up the mystery, provided action-packed climax, and ended with a resolution and an unexpected friendship, making the story quite engaging and complete."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Each individual   ant hardly weigh anything, but put together they weigh roughly the same as all of mankind. They also live nearly everywhere, except on frozen mountain tops and around the poles.Foranimals their size, ants have been astonishingly successful, largely due to their wonderfulsocial behavior. In colonies   that range in size from a few hundred to tens of millions, they organize their lives with a clear division of labor. Even more amazing is how they achievethis level of organization. Where we use sound and sight to communicate, ants dependprimarily on pheromone  , chemicals sent out by individuals and smelled or tastedby fellow members of their colony. When an ant finds food, it produces a pheromone that will lead others straight to where the food is. When an individual ant comes under attack or is dying, it sends out an alarm pheromone to warn the colony to prepare for a conflict as a defense unit. In fact, when it comes to the art of war, ants have no equal. They are completely fearless and will readily take on a creature much larger than themselves, attacking in large groups and overcoming their target. Such is their devotion to the common good of the colony that not only soldier ants but also worker ants will sacrifice their lives to help defeat an enemy. Behaving in this selfless and devoted manner, these little creatures have survived on Earth, for more than 140 million years, far longer than dinosaurs.

The initial exposé has opened the floodgates, and since then, dozens of women have come forward with their own related stories about the disgraced Hollywood producer. In a new development, the Times reported on Monday that two women have come forward to accuse Weinstein of sexually assaulting them in the 1970s, extending the timeline of allegations against Weinstein by over four decades. Hope Exiner d'Amore, now 62, alleges that Weinstein raped her in a New York City hotel in the late 1970s. Similarly, Cynthia Burr, also 62, claims that Weinstein forced her to perform oral sex on him in a building hallway during the same period in NYC. Exiner d'Amore told the Times, \\"This has haunted me my entire life.\\" The Times has also uncovered new allegations from two other women.

As attention shifts to Harvey's brother, Bob Weinstein, he is now facing serious troubles of his own. Two sources close to TWC executives reveal that Bob is increasingly considered a \\"liability\\" by the company's board of directors.

As the accusations and revelations continue to pour in, it's clear that the Weinstein scandal has not only shaken Hollywood but exposed the need for a broader conversation about power dynamics and the prevalence of sexual harassment and assault in the industry. The shocking allegations stretching back four decades have underscored the long-lasting effects of these actions on their victims and emphasized the importance of addressing and dismantling this culture of abuse."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Two villages were situated on different sides of the hill. Each village has its own approach to agriculture. East village decided to clear the land, by felling many trees and bushes, and set up a vast irrigation system. West village too a more natural approach to food production and applied the edible forest method, and all the permaculture principles over the years.  Which village had a decreased water table?  Hint: Groundwater salinization compromises buffering properties. Vegetation clearance, along with irrigation, causes serious issues. Irrigation increases the water table and mobilizes salts, and vegetation clearance allows it to come in contact with water habitats and vegetation. This stresses species not adapted to high salinity. High levels of salinity reduces water uptake in plants, by causing stomatal closure, reducing photosynthesis. Forests undergo decline in areas of high salinity and shallow groundwater depths because these conditions make them more susceptible to droughts. Forests undergo decline in areas of high salinity and shallow groundwater depths making them more susceptible to droughts. The answer is:","output":"East village.  Step 1: Analyze the given information The hint mentions that groundwater salinization compromises buffering properties, and both vegetation clearance and irrigation cause serious issues. It also states that irrigation increases the water table, mobilizes salts, and makes species more prone to high salinity stress. High salinity levels can reduce water uptake in plants, which can lead to forest decline in areas with high salinity and shallow groundwater depths. We also know that East village cleared land and set up an irrigation system, while West village applied permaculture principles with an edible forest method. Step 2: Compare the approaches of East and West villages East village cleared many trees and bushes, which would lead to vegetation clearance, while West village maintained their vegetation through permaculture practices. East village also implemented a vast irrigation system, which can increase the water table and mobilize salts. Step 3: Identify the village with a decreased water table Given the hint and the information about the approaches of each village, it is clear that East village is more likely to have experienced a decrease in water table due to the combination of vegetation clearance and irrigation. This would make the ecosystem in East village more susceptible to high salinity stress, reduced water uptake in plants, and potential forest decline. On the other hand, West village, with its focus on permaculture and forest preservation, would have maintained a more stable water table and experienced fewer negative effects on their ecosystem."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A mall Santa had a heart attack at work and was rushed to the Emergency Room in full cardiac arrest. Let me explain that a person playing Santa is generally a certain age (white beard) and body type (round) that is predisposed to cardiac disease. We did everything we could but ultimately our efforts were futile. The mall Santa rode his sleigh into the great beyond. A mother, there to visit another patient, was insistent that her 7–8 year old son be allowed back to visit his grandmother. We had a strict 12 year old age limit visitation policy. I was called to speak with her. ”Why do you have such a stupid Draconian policy?” She insisted. “The Emergency Room is no place for a child ma’am. Besides, the germs and infections he may be exposed to, there are things he may see or hear that a child would have a hard time processing,” I explained. “Like what?” She argued. “Well, there are people in pain moaning,” I answered. “And drunks cursing at the staff. It’s a tough place.” “He’s fine,” she insisted. “I think I know how to parent. I don’t need you to worry about what my son is able to handle.” I caved in and allowed her back. As we passed the room with the dead Santa, a tech exited and opened the curtain. Her child looked in and saw Santa’s lifeless body, ET tube sticking out of his throat, boots still on but costume cut to shreds and strewn across the room. The child lost it! “Mom, Santa Claus is Dead!” He cried. “I’m not going to get anything for Christmas.” “Why would someone open the curtain?” The mother demanded. “I warned you,” I said. “That’s why we have a 12 years and above visitation policy.” She was not happy.

Answer the following question: Question: \\"Who were the humanist anti-humanists?\\"  Context: \\"In his book, Humanism (1997), Tony Davies calls these critics \\"humanist anti-humanists\\". Critics of antihumanism, most notably Jürgen Habermas, counter that while antihumanists may highlight humanism's failure to fulfil its emancipatory ideal, they do not offer an alternative emancipatory project of their own. Others, like the German philosopher Heidegger considered themselves humanists on the model of the ancient Greeks, but thought humanism applied only to the German \\"race\\" and specifically to the Nazis and thus, in Davies' words, were anti-humanist humanists. Such a reading of Heidegger's thought is itself deeply controversial; Heidegger includes his own views and critique of Humanism in Letter On Humanism. Davies acknowledges that after the horrific experiences of the wars of the 20th century \\"it should no longer be possible to formulate phrases like 'the destiny of man' or the 'triumph of human reason' without an instant consciousness of the folly and brutality they drag behind them\\". For \\"it is almost impossible to think of a crime that has not been committed in the name of human reason\\". Yet, he continues, \\"it would be unwise to simply abandon the ground occupied by the historical humanisms. For one thing humanism remains on many occasions the only available alternative to bigotry and persecution. The freedom to speak and write, to organise and campaign in defence of individual or collective interests, to protest and disobey: all these can only be articulated in humanist terms.\\"\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"The humanist anti-humanists, as mentioned by Tony Davies in his book, Humanism (1997), refer to critics who identified the flaws and failures of humanism in its emancipatory ideals but did not offer alternative emancipatory projects themselves. An example of a humanist anti-humanist is Jürgen Habermas who countered the antihumanist movement. Another example is German philosopher Heidegger, who considered himself a humanist modeled on the ancient Greeks but believed that humanism only applied to the German \\"race\\" and specifically to the Nazis. This controversial interpretation of Heidegger's thought led Davies to label him an \\"anti-humanist humanist.\\" The humanist anti-humanists highlight the limitations of humanism, especially in light of the 20th-century wars' horrific experiences, but recognize the importance of humanism as an alternative to bigotry and persecution."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question about this movie plot. If it's un-answerable, please output \\"No answer\\".  Question: Who is the only SWORD agent to evade capture? Movie plot title: Vexille Movie plot: By the 2060s, robotics technology has become extremely advanced, including cybernetics. World opinion begins to turn against robotics, leading to the U.N. declaring a unilateral ban on further research in 2067. Japan, being home to robotics pioneer Daiwa Heavy Industries, strongly protests this ban, but is unable to prevent its passage. In protest, Japan withdraws from international politics. All foreigners are deported, and further immigration is prohibited. In addition, the R.A.C.E. network is constructedÂ â 270 off-shore installations that cover Japan with an energy field, nullifying all communication with the outside world and making satellite surveillance impossible. Trade and diplomacy continues, but Japan vanishes from the world scene. Ten years later, the United States Navy special warfare unit \\"SWORD\\" is trying to trap a Japanese informant for Daiwa in Colorado. The instigator, Saito, escapes by cutting off his own leg. Analysis shows the leg is made of bio-metal. SWORD suspects that Japan has concealed extensive development of banned technologies. They embark on an unapproved scheme to infiltrate Japan and to find out the frequency of the R.A.C.E. network, enabling SWORD to gather intelligence on the country. Although the agents successfully enter Japan, they are detected by security forces before they can transmit their data. Vexille is the sole SWORD agent to evade capture, and only her lover Leon survives to be taken to Daiwa's headquarters. Vexille awakens to find Tokyo is now a shanty town ruled by Daiwa. A small resistance movement opposes the company, and uses Vexille's transmitter to successfully transmit the distortion frequency. Maria, the head of the resistance, details the 10 years of secrecy while SWORD studies Japan in shocked horror â the islands are a lifeless wasteland. In 2067, an unknown disease struck Japan and was countered by an experimental vaccine. In actuality, the disease was created by Daiwa and the \\"vaccine\\" was used as an excuse for Daiwa to begin testing...

Stephen Arthur Stills (born January 3, 1945) is an American singer, songwriter, and multi-instrumentalist best known for his work with Buffalo Springfield and Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young. Beginning his professional career with Buffalo Springfield, he composed one of their few hits \\"For What It's Worth,\\" which became one of the most recognizable songs of the 1960s. Other notable songs he contributed to the band were \\"Sit Down, I Think I Love You Stills was involved with the musician Judy Collins from 1968 to 1969 and wrote the song \\"Suite: Judy Blue Eyes\\" for her. He dated actress and singer-songwriter Nancy Priddy who was the inspiration for his Buffalo Springfield song \\"Pretty Girl Why\\". He also had a short-term relationship with Rita Coolidge, as had Graham Nash, which apparently led to the initial breakup of CSN, in 1970. During a Manassas tour in France, Stills met and married his first wife, the singer-songwriter Veronique Sanson. Their son Christopher was born in 1974. They divorced in 1979. In 1976, Stills told Rolling Stone, \\"My hearing has gotten to be a terrible problem. If I keep playing and touring the way I have been, I'll go deaf.\\" In 1988, he married the Thai model Pamela Anne Jordan, with whom he had a daughter, Eleanor. His third wife is Kristen Hathaway (Kristen Stills), whom he married in 1996.  Stills's son, Justin Stills, was born in 1972 to Harriet Tunis. Justin was critically injured while snowboarding on Mt. Charleston, just outside Las Vegas, in 1997. An episode of Discovery Health's documentary series Trauma: Life in the ER featured his treatment and recovery. Another son, Henry, has been diagnosed with Asperger syndrome  and is profiled in the 2007 documentary Autism: The Musical. Stills's daughter Eleanor is a photographer and graduate of Art Center College of Design in Pasadena. Since Eleanor's graduation, she has been responsible for all recent Crosby, Stills & Nash photography. Stills has another daughter, Alex, who attends Emerson College in Boston, Massachusetts. His son Chris and daughter Jennifer are both recording artists. His youngest son, Oliver Ragland, was born in 2004 and named in honor of Neil Young, whose maternal family name is Ragland.  Like all four members of CSNY, Stills has long been involved in liberal causes and politics. In 2000, he served as a member of the Democratic credentials committee from Florida during the Democratic National Convention, and was a delegate in previous years.  The comic book series Scott Pilgrim features a character by the name of Stephen Stills, referred to as \\"the Talent\\" by the band he shares with the title character. The character also plays an acoustic guitar and sings, and is often portrayed wearing the kind of western shirts that is part of Stills's standard wardrobe. The series also has a reference to Stills's collaborator Neil Young in the character of Young Neil.

Where is the island of Montserrat?","output":"The island of Montserrat is a British Overseas Territory located in the Eastern Caribbean Sea. It is a part of the Lesser Antilles, a collection of islands situated within the eastern boundary of the Caribbean Sea and the western boundary of the Atlantic Ocean. The island is part of the Leeward Islands chain, which forms the Eastern Caribbean archipelago. Montserrat sits approximately 27 miles (43 kilometers) southwest of Antigua, its nearest neighbor, and about 30 miles (48 kilometers) northwest of Guadeloupe. The island has a geographical position of roughly 16°45′ N latitude and 62°12′ W longitude. This position places it in the North American region. The island has a total land area of approximately 39 square miles (102 square kilometers), with approximately 98% of this territory being volcanic in origin, dominated by the Soufrière Hills volcano. This volcano has been the most significant feature of Montserrat's geography in recent years. In 1995, a series of volcanic eruptions caused extensive damage to the island's southern portion and led to the establishment of an exclusion zone that covered more than half of the island. Montserrat's capital city, Plymouth, was also devastated in the disaster, forcing the government and residents to move northward. The coastal areas of Montserrat are characterized by rocky and steep shorelines, with some small black sand beaches. The topography of the island includes rolling hills, valleys, and lush tropical vegetation, which create an attractive environment for various flora and fauna. The climate is typically tropical, with an average temperature of about 81°F (27°C) and a rainy season from June to November. Montserrat has a rich history, starting with its initial settlement by the indigenous Arawak and Carib peoples. European colonization began when Christopher Columbus sighted the island in 1493 and named it after the Santa Maria de Montserrat, a famous monastery in Spain. Subsequently, the island was colonized by the British in the early 17th century. Montserrat's culture is a mix of African, British, and indigenous Caribbean influences, with English being the official language. Today, Montserrat is a partially self-governing territory overseen by the British government. It has a small and diverse population of around 5,000 people, with many residents involved in agriculture and tourism. The island is known for its unique volcanic landscape, beautiful scenery, and the Montserrat Oriole, the national bird, which is an endangered species native to the island."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The answer to this question is:","output":"Dan studied less about rocks breaking as a result of stress buildup. While both brothers had a strong passion and interest in geology, their focus areas differed significantly. Bob's area of study centered on sedimentary rocks, which are rocks formed from the accumulation and compression of sediment fragments, mineral particles, and organic materials such as shells, bones, and plant matter. This means he would have explored topics related to lithification, stratification, and the various types of sedimentary rocks, including clastic, chemical, and organic rocks. On the other hand, Dan specialized in the study of earthquakes and their location. Earthquakes involve the sudden release of energy in the Earth's crust, creating seismic waves that cause shaking and often lead to destruction. While this subject matter does relate to rocks and the Earth's crust, Dan's focus would have been more on understanding seismic activity and the factors contributing to the movement of tectonic plates. Earthquakes do involve rock breaking as a result of stress buildup, but this would be a smaller aspect of Dan's overall studies, as he would delve deeper into the mechanisms that trigger earthquakes, the properties of seismic waves, and methods for monitoring and predicting these natural disasters. Therefore, it is safe to say that Dan studied less about rocks breaking as a result of stress buildup compared to Bob, who dedicated his studies to the formation and characteristics of sedimentary rocks.

TEXT:I notice from the comments that most of the people discussing this movie are basing their remarks on the MST3K airing. That's fair enough (that is, after all, how it got its widest exposure), but, having had the misfortune of seeing \\"Final Justice\\" in its original form, I'd just like to share a few thoughts and comments on the uncut version. First off, it must be admitted that the original version is slightly more coherent than the MST3K broadcast, owing primarily to an expository scene between Rossano Brazzi and Venantino Venantini (I COULD use the characters' names instead of the actors', but I just love typing the words \\"Venantino Venantini\\"), explaining why Venantini's fugitive character can't just leave Malta right away. (It's not a very CONVINCING plot point, but at least the filmmakers tried to cover it.) Whether this scene was cut just for time or because it didn't provide much fodder for riffs, I don't know. Another plot point missing in the original: The stripper's betrayal of Venantino Venantini to Joe Don Baker, seemingly unmotivated in the MST3K version, is explained by an earlier, extremely unpleasant scene in which Venantini rapes her in the shower. While this does give her a motive for turning against him, the whole scenario is just really...icky. (There's no other word for it.) Some of the MST-worthy moments (the perpetual truncated shouts of \\"Son of a--\\" and the \\"deja vu\\" shooting of the sheriff) were purely the result of the edited-for-TV print they worked with, and were absent from the original movie. One scene I wish had made it into the MST3K version: Before entering the bar to question some people, Joe Don asks the Maltese policewoman accompanying him to stay outside, because \\"they see that uniform, they won't cooperate.\\" However, Joe Don himself is wearing his ridiculous cowboy-slash-sheriff outfit, complete with shiny badge! I can't imagine why they passed on that great opportunity to make fun of him... One final observation on the original, uncut version of \\"Final Justice\\": Why, oh why, did they feel the need to put Venantino Venantini's naked butt up on the screen?","output":"The sentiment of this text is (A). negative.

While recovering in the hospital, Julie attempts suicide by overdose, but cannot swallow the pills. After being released from the hospital, Julie closes up the house she lived in with her family and takes an apartment in Paris without telling anyone, or keeping any clothing or objects from her old life, except for a chandelier of blue beads that presumably belonged to her daughter.For the remainder of the film, Julie disassociates herself from all past memories and distances herself from former friendships, as can be derived from a conversation she has with her mother who suffers from Alzheimer's disease and believes Julie is her own sister Marie-France. She also destroys the score for her late husband's last commissioned, though unfinished, work: a piece celebrating European unity, following the end of the cold war. Snatches of the music haunt her throughout the film.Julie reluctantly befriends Lucille, an exotic dancer who is having an affair with one of the neighbors and helps her when she needs moral support when the tennants in their apartment building want to evit her . Despite her desire to live anonymously and alone, life in Paris forces Julie to confront elements of her past that she would rather not face, including Olivier, a friend of the couple, also a composer and former assistant of Patrice's at the conservatory, who is in love with her, and the fact that she is suspected to be the true author of her late husband's music. Olivier appears in a TV interview announcing that he shall try to complete Patrice's commission, and Julie also discovers that her late husband was having an affair with a younger woman.While both trying to stop Olivier from completing the score and finding out who her husband's mistress was, Julie becomes more engaged despite her own efforts not to be.

Answer:","output":"\\"Echoes of Blue: A Symphony of Loss and Rediscovery\\" In \\"Echoes of Blue: A Symphony of Loss and Rediscovery\\", we follow Julie's emotional journey as she navigates her own grief and the unfolding mysteries surrounding her late husband Patrice de Courcy and daughter's life. The title highlights the significance of the blue chandelier beads, which serve as a recurring motif throughout the film, representing both Julie's emotional connection to her late daughter and her determined efforts to sever ties with her past. The word \\"echoes\\" in the title signifies the haunting memory of Patrice's unfinished musical composition, which resonates throughout the film as Julie gradually uncovers the truth about her husband's life. Additionally, it represents the familiar patterns that emerge as Julie finds herself inadvertently drawn back into the world she tried to leave behind, including her budding relationship with Olivier and her compassion toward Lucille. The phrase \\"a symphony of loss and rediscovery\\" not only metaphorically portrays the film's central conflict as Julie struggles with grief, rejection, and redemption, but also alludes to the actual music within the storyline.

David Webb's journey of losing weight, gaining fitness, and achieving worldwide success with his opera group is nothing short of awe-inspiring. In this article, we will explore how David managed to shed an impressive 6 stones and reduce his body fat from 40% to a super fit 13 stone. We will also touch upon his involvement with the cleft palate charity, Operation Smile. 1. David's Struggle with Comfort Eating As a teenager, David struggled with comfort eating throughout his formative years. He continued his unhealthy habits well into his gap years. As a result, he reached a massive 19 stone in weight, with 40% of it being body fat. At this point, David knew that it was time for a change. He could no longer afford to overlook the risks associated with poor health and severe obesity. 2. Discovering the Caveman Diet and Crossfit as a Dangerous Duo David began researching various diet plans in a desperate attempt to shed some weight. It was not long before he discovered the caveman diet, also known as the Paleo or Paleolithic diet. This diet focuses on consuming whole, nutrient-dense foods, such as vegetables, fruits, meats, and healthy fats, similar to what our ancestors would have eaten thousands of years ago. David adopted the caveman diet and complemented it with a Crossfit exercise regime. Crossfit workouts are high-intensity sessions, typically lasting only 10 to 20 minutes. They consist of a combination of strength and cardio exercises, which are transformative in promoting overall fitness, endurance, and agility. Through a diligent combination of a strict Paleo diet and a dynamic Crossfit routine, David underwent a remarkable transformation. 3. Achieving Worldwide Success David's consistent effort and dedication to improving his physical and mental health did not go unnoticed. He became a part of the opera group Amore, which has since achieved worldwide success. With his newfound confidence, David is now able to perform on the world stage, using opera as a positive outlet to showcase his incredible vocal talent. 4. Giving Back: The 300-mile charity ride for Operation Smile David has decided to take his fitness journey one step further, riding an impressive 300 miles over the course of three days as part of a fundraiser for the cleft palate charity, Operation Smile. This organization works tirelessly to provide essential surgery and treatment for children born with cleft lips and palates around the world. By contributing to this cause, David gets to experience firsthand the impact of his incredible journey on the lives of others, inspiring him to keep pushing his physical boundaries. Conclusion David Webb's amazing body transformation should serve as inspiration to anyone who believes that their current situation is insurmountable. Through a combination of a healthy diet, regular exercise, and unshakable determination, David was able not only to overcome his weight problem but also to achieve international success and give back to a charitable cause.

Write an article based on this summary: As if nothing had changed, Welsh farmers will have risen early this morning to milk their cows or feed their stock. Article:","output":"Title: A Glimpse Into the Unchanging Routine of Welsh Farmers Introduction In a world that increasingly revolves around technology and novel innovations, it is refreshing to know that some traditions remain intact. Welsh farmers, for instance, continue to follow their age-old, time-tested practices when it comes to tending to their livestock. As if nothing had changed, these hard-working individuals rise early each morning to milk their cows or feed their stock. In this article, we will delve into this world of unchanging routines and the dedication of Welsh farmers. Early Morning Rituals The sun has barely risen as Welsh farmers begin their day. The predawn hours are crucial for these individuals who have dedicated their lives to the age-old profession of farming. Their first responsibility is to milk the cows - a task that requires patience, skill, and a deep understanding of bovine life. The milk, so diligently collected, is then either sold or used to create dairy products such as cheese and yogurt. Ensuring the wellbeing of their livestock is also of the utmost importance. While the cows are being milked, the rest of the stock, such as sheep, pigs, and poultry, are also fed and tended to by the farmers. This ensures that the livestock remains healthy and productive, capable of sustaining the livelihoods of several rural Welsh communities. The Value of Tradition Despite the numerous advances in technology and the availability of modern farming techniques, Welsh farmers choose to adhere to their traditional ways. This decision not only maintains the quality of the produce but also preserves the cultural legacy of the region. In a world where globalization and commercialization have become the norm, this dedication to tradition is both admirable and poignant. Supporting Local Communities These unchanging routines of Welsh farmers serve a greater purpose than just the continuation of age-old practices. Their labor empowers rural communities by providing a steady supply of wholesome, locally sourced food to the people. Furthermore, this fosters a sense of self-sufficiency in rural Wales by reducing reliance on imported goods. In addition to being economically beneficial, this practice promotes a sustainable way of living that is in harmony with the environment. Local produce has a smaller carbon footprint compared to imported goods, making the reliance on Welsh farmers and their livestock a more environmentally friendly choice. Conclusion As the world around them continues to evolve, Welsh farmers remain steadfast in their commitment to time-honored traditions. Rising early each day to care for and nourish their livestock, these individuals prioritize the welfare of their animals and the sustainability of their community. Their dedication to tradition is both a testament to the resilience of rural life in Wales and a source of inspiration for the generations to come."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Movie title: ParaNorman Context: In the small town of Blithe Hollow, Massachusetts, Norman Babcock (Kodi Smit-McPhee) is an 11-year-old boy who speaks with the dead, including his late grandmother (Elaine Stritch) and various ghosts in town. Almost no one believes him and he is isolated emotionally from his family while being ridiculed by his peers. His best friend, Neil Downe (Tucker Albrizzi), is an overweight boy who is bullied himself and finds in Norman a kindred spirit. During rehearsal of a school play commemorating the town's execution of a witch three centuries ago, Norman has a vision of the town's past in which he is pursued through the woods by townsfolk on a witch hunt. Afterward, the boys are confronted by Norman's estranged and seemingly deranged uncle Mr. Prenderghast (John Goodman) who tells his nephew that he soon must take up his regular ritual to protect the town. Soon after this encounter, Prenderghast dies from a sudden stroke. During the official performance of the school play Norman has another vision, creating a public spectacle of himself which leads to his father Perry (Jeff Garlin) grounding him. His mother Sandra (Leslie Mann) tells him that his father's stern manner is because he is afraid for him. The next day, Norman sees Prenderghast's spirit who tells him that the ritual must be performed with a certain book before sundown that day; then making him swear to complete the task, Prenderghast's spirit is set free and crosses over. Norman is at first reluctant to go because he is scared but his grandmother tells him it is all right to be scared as long as he does not let it change who he is. Norman sets off to retrieve the book from Prenderghast's house (having to take it from his corpse). He then goes to the graves of the five men and two women who were cursed by the witch, but finds that the book is merely a series of fairy tales. Alvin (Christopher Mintz-Plasse), a school bully, arrives and prevents Norman from reading the story before sundown. Norman attempts to continue reading from the book, to no effect. A...","output":"In the movie ParaNorman, Norman Babcock, an 11-year-old boy with the ability to speak to the dead, is tasked with the responsibility of protecting his small town of Blithe Hollow, Massachusetts. This responsibility comes as a result of a witch's curse that was placed on the town centuries ago, during the time when the witch was executed. In order to lift the curse and protect the town, Norman must perform a ritual with a certain book before sundown as per the instructions of his deceased, deranged uncle Mr. Prenderghast. Protection of the town revolves around Norman's unique ability to communicate with ghosts and his willingness to confront the supernatural. Throughout the film, Norman encounters various challenges and setbacks, including isolation from his own family, ridicule from his peers, a lack of understanding from the townspeople, and even bullying from the school bully, Alvin. However, Norman finds emotional support from his best friend Neil, an overweight boy who is also victim to bullying, and his late grandmother's spirit who encourages him to face his fears. As the story unfolds, Norman attempts to complete the ritual before sundown but is thwarted by Alvin, which leads to a failure in lifting the curse. Nonetheless, Norman doesn't give up and continues to find a way to protect the town, despite the rising supernatural threats from the witch's curse. In a critical moment, Norman comes face-to-face with the spirit of the witch responsible for the town's curse, Aggie Prenderghast, revealing that she was a scared and misunderstood little girl who was wrongfully executed for her abilities. Norman demonstrates courage, empathy, and understanding, connecting with her on a personal level, ultimately helping Aggie accept her mistakes and start on a path of forgiveness. Through this encounter, Norman not only manages to save the town but also teaches the townspeople about the power of compassion and understanding towards those who are different. In conclusion, Norman protects the town by embracing his unique ability to communicate with the dead and facing his fears head-on. By staying true to himself and finding the courage within, Norman navigates the complexities of the curse, the town's history, and personal relationships to lift the curse and bring peace to both the living and the dead. His journey illustrates the importance of empathy and understanding when it comes to individuals who are misunderstood or different, ultimately changing the town for the better."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Write an article that answers the following question: How many years was the Suez canal defended from Ottoman attacks?","output":"Title: The Defense of the Suez Canal: Countering Ottoman Attacks during World War I Introduction The Suez Canal, a man-made waterway that meanders through Egypt and directly connects the Mediterranean Sea with the Red Sea, has played a vital role in global transport and trade since it was completed in 1869. This prime location has made it a target of numerous strategic conflicts, notably between the British Empire and the Ottoman Empire during World War I. In this article, we will delve into the history of the Suez Canal and examine how many years it was defended from Ottoman attacks. A Brief History of the Suez Canal Before addressing the defense of the Suez Canal from attacks, it is essential to understand its significance. The canal was constructed under the supervision of a French-led company between 1859 and 1869, and its completion enabled ships to bypass African Cape of Good Hope, cutting voyage times between Europe and Asia considerably. The Suez Canal quickly became a valuable geostrategic region, and in 1875, Britain acquired a controlling interest in the canal, recognizing its potential as a secure link between the British Isles and their colonial holdings in Asia and Africa. World War I and the British Defense of the Suez Canal Britain officially entered World War I on August 4, 1914, after Germany invaded Belgium. Seeing an opportunity, the Ottoman Empire joined forces with the Central Powers (Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Bulgaria) in late October 1914, seeking to regain their lost territories in Europe, Asia, and Africa. As the war intensified, the strategically positioned Suez Canal became central to the British war effort. It was a crucial supply route to British colonies and facilitated the transport of troops, equipment, and other resources between Britain, India, Australia, New Zealand, and Egypt. Consequently, it was imperative to defend the canal from potential attacks by the Central Powers, specifically the persistent adversary, the Ottoman Empire. Timeline of Ottoman Attacks and British Defense The defense of the Suez Canal from Ottoman attacks spanned a period of approximately two years, from 1914-1916. Over these years, the British and their allies strove to prevent Ottoman forces from capturing the canal, organizing defenses and launching counter-offensives. Below is a detailed timeline of events: 1. December 1914-January 1915: Pre-emptive defense measures were taken by British troops, setting up checkpoints and fortifications along the canal's length. They even sank old ships to block potential access points. This period marked the beginning of the defense against the anticipated Ottoman incursion. 2. January-February 1915: The first major encounter, known as the First Suez Offensive, occurred when Ottoman forces attacked the canal in an attempt to disrupt Allied supply routes. British and international troops stationed along the canal quickly repelled the attack, inflicting heavy casualties on the invaders. 3. July 1915: By mid-1915, British forces had fortified their positions significantly, constructing trenches, laying out barbed wire, and positioning artillery to thwart the advance of enemy troops. During this period, battles erupted in the Sinai Peninsula, where British and Empire troops fought against the Ottoman forces, weakening their ability to launch further attacks on the canal. 4. April 23, 1916: The Second Suez Offensive saw Ottoman forces attempting one more major assault on the canal. However, British forces, bolstered by Indian and Australian troops, displayed exemplary defensive tactics, ultimately repelling the Ottoman attack. Ottoman forces suffered significant losses, and their ambitions to control the Suez Canal collapsed in the face of overwhelming British resistance. Conclusion From the onset of British involvement in World War I in 1914 until the final failed Ottoman offensive in 1916, the Suez Canal was actively defended for approximately two years. British forces, with valuable support from their empire and international allies, effectively secured this vital supply route throughout the conflict, ensuring its continued use and reinforcing its geopolitical importance in the region. Today, the Suez Canal stands as a testament to the enduring strategic value of this critical waterway in the global trade network and serves as a reminder of the fierce battles once fought to protect it."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Given the following passage  \\"In his book, Humanism (1997), Tony Davies calls these critics \\"humanist anti-humanists\\". Critics of antihumanism, most notably Jürgen Habermas, counter that while antihumanists may highlight humanism's failure to fulfil its emancipatory ideal, they do not offer an alternative emancipatory project of their own. Others, like the German philosopher Heidegger considered themselves humanists on the model of the ancient Greeks, but thought humanism applied only to the German \\"race\\" and specifically to the Nazis and thus, in Davies' words, were anti-humanist humanists. Such a reading of Heidegger's thought is itself deeply controversial; Heidegger includes his own views and critique of Humanism in Letter On Humanism. Davies acknowledges that after the horrific experiences of the wars of the 20th century \\"it should no longer be possible to formulate phrases like 'the destiny of man' or the 'triumph of human reason' without an instant consciousness of the folly and brutality they drag behind them\\". For \\"it is almost impossible to think of a crime that has not been committed in the name of human reason\\". Yet, he continues, \\"it would be unwise to simply abandon the ground occupied by the historical humanisms. For one thing humanism remains on many occasions the only available alternative to bigotry and persecution. The freedom to speak and write, to organise and campaign in defence of individual or collective interests, to protest and disobey: all these can only be articulated in humanist terms.\\"\\",  answer the following question.

Long Queue vs Online Tickets You can either wait in line to get in or buy tickets online for specific time slots to bypass the line. Wait times can be anywhere from 30 minutes to 3+ hours and in the summer time, it’s common to wait for hours. I definitely recommend buying a ticket online. Keep in mind that they have a limited number of tickets for each time slot, so don’t wait too long to buy or you may be stuck in that loooooong line. We got quite a few less-then-friendly looks from those in the line when we bypassed the entire queue and went right in. C’est la vie (insert Gallic shrug here). For some inexplicable reason, the site says you must print your tickets if you buy them online. Given that most visitors to the catacombs are tourists with limited or no access to a printer, this seems particularly silly, but what can you do? Luckily, we were in a hotel with a small business center so we printed our tickets there. Online tickets cost quite a bit more (27€ compared to 12€ for adults and 10€ for those age 26 or under). Totally worth it if that works with your budget. Online tickets also come with an audio guide. If you buy tickets at the door, the guide is an extra 5€.

The Myth Of Free Market Health Care In America ObamaCare is in retreat. That much was clear the moment the president started springing B-grade Hollywood references to \\"blue pills and red pills\\" in its defense during his news conference last week. But before ObamaCare can be beaten back decisively, its critics need to answer this question: How did his plan for a government takeover of roughly a fifth of the U.S. economy get this far in the first place? The answer is not that Democrats have a lock on Washington right now--although they do. Nor that Republicans are intellectually bereft--although they are. The answer is that both ObamaCare's supporters and opponents believe that--unlike Europe--America has something called a free market health care system. So long as this myth holds sway, it will be exceedingly difficult to prescribe free market fixes to America's health care woes--or, conversely, end the lure of big government remedies. The fact of the matter is that America's health care system is like a free market in the same way that Madonna is like a virgin--i.e. in fiction only. If anything, the U.S. system has many more similarities than differences with France and Germany. The only big outlier among European nations is England, which, even in a post-communist world, has managed the impressive feat of hanging on to a socialized, single-payer model. This means that the U.K. government doesn't just pays for medical services but actually owns and operates the hospitals that provide them. English doctors are government employees! But apart from England, most European countries have a public-private blend, not unlike what we have in the U.S. The major difference between America and Europe of course is that America does not guarantee universal health insurance whereas Europe does. But this is not as big a deal as it might seem. Uncle Sam, along with state governments, still picks up nearly half of the country's 2.5 trillion annual health care tab. More importantly, contrary to popular mythology, America does offer public care of sorts. It directly covers about a third of all Americans through Medicare (the public program for the elderly) and Medicaid (the public program for the poor). But it also indirectly covers the uninsured by--at least in part--paying for their emergency care. In effect, anyone in America who does not have private insurance is on the government dole in one way or another. This is not radically different from France, where the government offers everyone basic public coverage, of course--but a whopping 90% of the French also buy supplemental private insurance to help pay for the 20% to 40% of their tab that the public plan doesn't cover. Meanwhile, in Germany, about 12.5% of Germans who are civil employees or above a certain income opt out of the public system altogether and rely solely on private coverage--even though they know it is well nigh impossible to return to the public system once they switch. And more Germans likely would go private if they were not legally banned from doing so. The most striking similarity between America, France and Germany, however, is the model of \\"insurance\\" upon which their health care systems are based. In other insurance markets, the more coverage you want, the more you have to pay for it. Consider auto insurance, for instance. If you want everything--from oil changes to collision protection--you'd have to pay more than someone who wants just basic collision protection. That's not how it works in health care. For the same flat fee--regardless of whether it is paid for primarily through taxes as in France in Germany or through lost wages as in America--patients in all three countries effectively get an ATM card on which they can expense everything (barring co-pays) regardless of what the final tab adds up to. (Catastrophic coverage plans are available in America, but the market is extremely limited for a number of reasons, including the fact that most states have issued Patients Bill of Rights mandating all kinds of fancy benefits even in basic plans.) Thus, in neither country do patients have much incentive to restrain consumption or shop for cheaper providers. In America and Germany, patients don't even know how much most medical services cost. In France, patients know the prices because they have to pay up front and get reimbursed by their insurer later--a lame attempt to ensure some price consciousness. But since there is no cap on the reimbursed amount, the French sometimes shop for doctors based on such things as office decor rather than prices, according to a study by David Green and Benedict Irvine, researchers at Civitas, a London-based think tank. (Green and Irvine reported this as a good thing.) So what are the consequences of this \\"insurance\\" model and how are the three countries coping with it? America, as Obama continuously reminds us, spends 16% of its gross domestic product on health care--the highest percentage in the world. If current trends persist, in 75 years health care will consume about 50% of the GDP--and all of the federal budget. But France is not doing a whole lot better. Its health care system is the third most expensive in the world with over 11% of its GDP going toward health care--nearly three times more than the amount in 1960. The French fork over more than 20% of their income in taxes for public coverage (and another 2.5% to purchase supplemental private coverage)--yet their public program suffers from chronic deficits. Germany, similarly, spends about 11% of its GDP on health care with Germans contributing more than 15% of their income toward buying health care. If France and Germany are not spending even more on health care, one big reason is rationing. Universal health care advocates pretend that there is no rationing in France and Germany because these countries don't have long waiting lines for MRIs, surgical procedures and other medical services as in England and Canada. And patients have more or less unrestricted access to specialists. But it is unclear how long this will last. Struggling with exploding costs, the French government has tried several times--only to back off in the face of a public outcry--to prod doctors into using only standardized treatments. In 1994, it started imposing fines of up to roughly 4,000 on doctors who deviated from \\"mandatory practice guidelines.\\" It switched from this \\"sticks\\" to a \\"carrots\\" approach four years later, and tried handing bonuses to doctors who adhered to the guidelines. Meanwhile, in Germany, \\"sickness funds\\"--the equivalent of insurance companies--have imposed strict budgets on doctors for prescription drugs. Doctors who exceed their cap are simply denied reimbursement, something that forces them to prescribe less effective invasive procedures for problems that would have been better treated with drugs. But the most potent form of rationing in France and Germany--and indeed much of Europeis not overt, but covert: delayed access to cutting-edge drugs and therapies that become available to American patients years in advance. The point is that there is no health care model, whether privately or publicly financed, that can offer unlimited access to medical services while containing costs. Ultimately, such a model arrives at a cross roads where it has to either limit access in an arbitrary way, or face uncontrolled cost increases. France and Germany, which are mostly publicly funded, are increasingly marching down the first road. America, which is half publicly and half privately funded, has so far taken the second path. Should America offer even more people such unlimited access through universal coverage, it too will end up rationing care or facing national bankruptcy. The only sustainable system that avoids this Hobson's choice is one that is based on a genuine free market in which there is some connection between what patients pay for coverage and the services they receive. That is emphatically not what America or any Western country has today. Looking to these countries for solutions as Obama and other advocates of universal health coverage are doing will lead to false diagnoses and false cures.

Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"The Myth Of Free Market Health Care In America is an opinion piece that argues the misconception of a free market healthcare system in the U.S. perpetuates ineffective solutions, and only a genuine free market system can provide sustainable healthcare without driving up costs or limiting access arbitrarily."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

During the summer campaign of 1673, Turenne had the thankless task of trying to contain Leopold's troops under the command of Raimondo Montecuccoli. Montecuccoli finally joined with the Dutch troops of William III to besiege and take the city of Bonn from the French. In August 1673, The Habsburg monarchies of Spain and the Holy Roman Empire signed a formal alliance with the Republic that required that France be returned to her boundaries of 1659. This alliance was strengthened in October by Charles IV of Lorraine. Imperial and Dutch troops conquered the town of Naarden from the French on 13 September. The Spanish, who had yet to formally enter the war, declared war on the French on 16 October. At about the same time Frederick William re-entered the war against France. The position of Louis at this stage was bad enough, but it worsened when England made a separate peace, the Treaty of Westminster, with all of the nations arrayed against France on 19 February 1674.

In conclusion, endorsing David Gallop's comments signifies the necessary commitment to address and combat the serious issue of sexual assault and degradation of women within the National Rugby League. This responsibility should be shared by all stakeholders in the game, and a united effort is required to create the necessary culture change to ensure that the future of the sport is one built on respect, inclusivity, and safety for all."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","output":"The currency used in Afghanistan is called the Afghan Afghani, commonly abbreviated as AFN (Afghanistan Afghani). The Afghani is the official form of money within Afghanistan and is regulated by the Central Bank of Afghanistan, known as Da Afghanistan Bank. Historically, the currency has gone through several incarnations, initially inaugurating in 1925 as the Kabuli Rupee, which eventually gave way to the Afghani in 1926. Throughout its history, the Afghan Afghani has faced various fluctuations and reforms. The first Afghani was used from 1926 to 2002 and was denoted by the abbreviation AFA (Afghanistan Afghanis). However, due to economic turbulence and political instability, particularly during the Soviet invasion and the ensuing civil war, the value of the Afghani faced significant depreciation. It was during this time that the value of the Afghani was pegged to multiple currencies, such as the US Dollar and the Soviet Ruble. As part of efforts to stabilize and revive the Afghan economy after the fall of the Taliban regime, the new Afghan Afghani (AFN) was introduced in 2002. This new currency replaced the old Afghani (AFA) at a rate of 1 AFN = 1000 AFA. The overhaul aimed at improving economic stability and regaining public trust in the currency, and since then, the AFN has been relatively stable. The Afghan Afghani is divided into 100 smaller units called pul, although pul coins are not commonly used due to their low value. Currently, Afghan banknotes are available in denominations of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 500, and 1000 Afghanis, while coins are available in denominations of 1, 2, and 5 Afghanis as well as 25, 50, and 100 pul. Moreover, the banknotes have undergone many designs and security updates, with the latest series released in 2020 featuring enhanced anti-counterfeiting measures. The economy of Afghanistan is primarily driven by agriculture, with the country being a notable producer of fruits, nuts, wool, and opium. Furthermore, the service and construction sectors have experienced significant growth in the past years. However, the nation still struggles with substantial challenges, including political instability, corruption, and inadequate infrastructure. This situation often leads to fluctuations in currency value, making it crucial for the Central Bank of Afghanistan to maintain control and ensure the Afghani's stability."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write some highlights for the following article: By. John Hall. People from the north of England consider London to be chaotic, crowded and bad for Britain, according to a study released today. Only 24 per cent of those living outside the capital think London has a positive impact on their local economy, with that figure even lower in northern cities such as Liverpool and Sheffield, where the number drops to just nine per cent and eight per cent respectively. While two thirds of the population agree London has a positive impact on the national economy, the same number argue that the capital unfairly benefits from central government being based there. Divide: While two thirds of the population agree London benefits the national economy (green figures), only 24 per cent of those living outside the capital think it has a positive impact at a local level (red figures) The figures come from a report for Centre for Cities and the Centre for London, with YouGov questioning residents in 16 towns and cities across the UK. The study confirms the suspicion of a growing divide between London and the rest of the country - something that has long been suggested by the capital's property bubble. The results point to something a ripple effect in opinion, with the towns and cities closest to London feeling most positive about the capital's impact, and those further away feeling the least positive. This is magnified in parts of Yorkshire, with just eight per cent of those living in Hull and Sheffield thinking London has a positive impact on their city. The results are not must better in Leeds where the number is 13 per cent. Unfair: Only 24 per cent of non-Londoners think the capital (pictured) has a positive impact on their local economy. Meanwhile two thirds argue London unfairly benefits from central government being based there. Ignored: Only 17 per cent of non-Londoners think Westminster politicians such as Chancellor George Osborne (left) and Prime Minister David Cameron (right) are responsive to local issues. It's not just the capital's economic impact that has been called into question. Three quarters of those asked also felt the media focuses too much on London at the expense of other British cities. Meanwhile 64 per cent of non-Londoners claimed the government paid too much attention to issues in the capital, with only 17 per cent thinking Westminster politicians were responsive to local issues. The only city to buck this trend was Manchester, where a slightly more positive 21 per cent either strongly agreed to tended to agree with the claim that Whitehall was in touch with local issues. But despite feeling unhappy Londoners get a much better deal than those living in other parts of the country, only one in five said they would consider moving to the capital to improve their opportunities. This, it was suggested, is down to a widespread belief that London is not a happy or comfortable place to live. Responding to questions on their opinions of quality of life in the capital, 62 per cent on non-Londoners described it as 'expensive', 59 per cent as 'crowded' and 30 per cent as 'chaotic'. Only 32 per cent thought London was a good place to raise a family.","output":"This article is about a study that shows how people from the north of England think about London. They see it as very messy, too full of people, and not very good for the rest of the country. The study found that only a small number of people who live outside London think it helps their local economy, and the numbers are even smaller in cities like Liverpool and Sheffield. Most people do agree that London is helpful for the whole country's economy. But they also think it gets more benefits from the government than other places because that's where the government is. The study showed that people who live closer to London think more positively about it, while people who live farther away don't feel as good about it. People also think that the government and news focus too much on London and don't pay enough attention to other cities. Even though people think London gets a better deal, not many of them would want to move there because they don't think it's a nice place to live."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.
