Movie title: The Descent Movie plot: On her way back from whitewater rafting with her friends Juno (Natalie Mendoza) and Beth (Alex Reid), Sarah (Shauna Macdonald), along with her husband Paul (Oliver Milburn) and their daughter Jessica (Molly Kayll) get involved in a car accident when Paul is distracted. Paul and Jessica are killed, but Sarah survives. One year later, Sarah and her friends Juno, Beth, Sam (MyAnna Buring), Rebecca (Saskia Mulder), and newcomer Holly (Nora-Jane Noone) are reunited at a cabin in the Appalachian Mountains of North Carolina. While spelunking, Juno apologises to Sarah for not being there for her after the accident, but Sarah is distant. As the group moves through a passage, it collapses behind them, trapping them. After a heated discussion, Juno admits she led the group into an unknown cave system instead of the fully explored cave system like they originally planned, and that rescue is impossible because of this. She then tells Sarah that she led them into the unknown cave in the hopes of restoring their relationship, but Sarah rebuffs her. As the group presses forward, they discover climbing equipment from a previous spelunker, and a cave painting that suggests an exit exists. Holly, thinking she sees sunlight, runs ahead, but falls down a hole and breaks her leg. As the others help Holly, Sarah wanders off and observes a pale, humanoid creature (called \\"crawlers\\" in the credits) drinking at a pool before it scampers away. Later, the group comes across a den of animal bones, and are suddenly attacked by a crawler. Holly is injured and dragged away by the crawler to her death, Sarah is knocked out by a fall, and Juno accidentally stabs Beth through the neck with a pickaxe after mistaking her for the crawler. Sarah awakens to find herself in a den of human and animal carcasses, and witnesses Holly's body being consumed by a crawler. Juno discovers markings pointing to a specific path through the caves.

Article:Sadly that is far from the case, and in practice, it is difficult, if not impossible, to get definitive rulings in international law involving military intervention. There is no international court on hand to give the legal go-ahead to intervene. However, there is a developing legal framework for military intervention on humanitarian grounds. Known as the Responsibility to Protect, or R2P, it was born out of the humanitarian disasters of the 1990s in Kosovo and Rwanda. It is widely but not universally accepted and has three principal elements: In order to have maximum legitimacy, military intervention should be authorised by the UN Security Council.  It holds a unique position as the primary arbiter on the use of force in international law. However, as in the case of Syria, it may be hamstrung by a lack of consensus, with one or more members opposed to action. In these situations, according to one view, R2P provides a legal framework for the international community to use military force as a last resort - either by way of a regional coalition or a so-called \\"coalition of the willing\\". There are a number of safeguards in R2P: In other words, it is a limited power to act.  However, if all of the criteria are met, then the limited and targeted use of military force would be legal in international law under R2P, some lawyers and commentators believe. Ultimately though, military interventions in these circumstances are up to governments rather than lawyers. It is for them to make the case for military intervention by showing that the legal requirements have been met. In the case of Syria, they will argue that there is an ongoing atrocity, all peaceful means of stopping it have been exhausted, and that targeted military action could achieve the twin goals of ending the atrocity and protecting the civilian population. Summarize the main points of that article.","output":"The article discusses the challenges of obtaining definitive rulings in international law regarding military intervention.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the last name of the person who said that she was engaged?, using the article: Lennon met Cynthia Powell (1939–2015) in 1957, when they were fellow students at the Liverpool College of Art. Although Powell was intimidated by Lennon's attitude and appearance, she heard that he was obsessed with the French actress Brigitte Bardot, so she dyed her hair blonde. Lennon asked her out, but when she said that she was engaged, he screamed out, \\"I didn't ask you to fuckin' marry me, did I?\\" She often accompanied him to Quarrymen gigs and travelled to Hamburg with McCartney's girlfriend to visit him. Lennon was jealous by nature and eventually grew possessive, often terrifying Powell with his anger and physical violence.

He said that the Beatles song \\"Getting Better\\" told his own story, \\"I used to be cruel to my woman, and physically – any woman. I was a hitter. I couldn't express myself and I hit. I fought men and I hit women. That is why I am always on about peace.\\"Recalling his July 1962 reaction when he learned that Cynthia was pregnant, Lennon said, \\"There's only one thing for it Cyn. We'll have to get married.\\" The couple wed on 23 August at the Mount Pleasant Register Office in Liverpool, with Brian Epstein serving as best man. His marriage began just as Beatlemania was taking off across the UK. He performed on the evening of his wedding day and would continue to do so almost daily from then on. Epstein feared that fans would be alienated by the idea of a married Beatle, and he asked the Lennons to keep their marriage secret. Julian was born on 8 April 1963; Lennon was on tour at the time and did not see his infant son until three days later.Cynthia attributed the start of the marriage breakdown to Lennon's use of LSD, and she felt that he slowly lost interest in her as a result of his use of the drug.

I am verifying the answers generated by an automatic system to the following question: what countries legalize marijuana Suggested answer: The legality of cannabis varies from country to country. Should I validate this answer? Answer:","output":"In order to validate the suggested answer, it is essential to provide a more comprehensive and up-to-date list of countries where marijuana has been legalized. While the legality of cannabis indeed varies from country to country, the answer would be more detailed if it at least mentioned some countries that have adopted a more lenient approach towards the use of marijuana.  Here is a more detailed response: The legalization of marijuana has been an ongoing debate worldwide, with many countries taking different approaches. As mentioned, the legality of cannabis does indeed vary from country to country, with some nations fully legalizing it for recreational use, while others restrict it to medicinal purposes or decriminalize it. While it is difficult to provide an exhaustive list of all the countries that have legalized marijuana to some extent, here are some notable examples: 1. Canada: In 2018, Canada became the second country in the world to fully legalize recreational marijuana nationwide. Medical marijuana has been legal since 2001. 2. Uruguay: In 2013, Uruguay was the first country to legalize cannabis for recreational use. 3. The Netherlands: Although not officially legal, marijuana has been decriminalized for personal use since 1976. Amsterdam is particularly well-known for its coffee shops where you can buy and consume marijuana. 4. United States: The legal status of marijuana varies from state to state. As of 2021, 18 states and the District of Columbia have legalized recreational marijuana, while 36 states have legalized it for medical use. However, marijuana remains illegal at the federal level. 5. Georgia: In 2018, the Georgian Constitutional Court decriminalized marijuana consumption, although selling and cultivation remain illegal. 6. South Africa: In a landmark ruling in 2018, South Africa decriminalized the private use and cultivation of marijuana for adults. 7. Portugal: In 2001, Portugal decriminalized possession and use of all drugs, including marijuana. Though cannabis is still illegal, those found in possession of small amounts are referred to rehabilitation and treatment programs instead of facing criminal prosecution. 8. Spain: While marijuana remains illegal according to the country's criminal code, personal use and cultivation in private spaces have been decriminalized. Additionally, Cannabis Social Clubs, non-profit organizations for marijuana growers and consumers, operate in a legal gray area. 9. Mexico: In 2021, Mexico's Supreme Court declared the criminalization of recreational marijuana to be unconstitutional, paving the way for future legalization. 10. Israel: Medical marijuana has been legal in Israel since the early 1990s, but recreational use remains illegal. However, Israel has started to decriminalize marijuana possession, treating it as an administrative offense rather than a criminal violation. While this list is by no means exhaustive, it provides a more informative and in-depth answer to the question of which countries legalize marijuana. The suggested answer in the automated response should be updated to reflect this broader scope of information in order to ensure accuracy and depth."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(CNN) -- Google recently announced that it would start including individual users' names and photos in some ads. This means that if you rate some product positively, your friends may see ads for that product with your name and photo attached -- without your knowledge or consent. Meanwhile, Facebook is eliminating a feature that allowed people to retain some portions of their anonymity on its website. These changes come on the heels of Google's move to explore replacing tracking cookies with something that users have even less control over. Microsoft is doing something similar by developing its own tracking technology.

The story largely centers around Google’s recent changes to its advertising system, tracking user behavior, and subsequently manipulating ads based on the user data collected by Google searches. As such, it would be most logical to conclude that the company mentioned in the last line is Google, and that they have knowledge of the user's thoughts through their Google searches. Explanation for wrong answers: - Bruce Schneier searches, Schneier searches: Bruce Schneier is an American cryptographer, computer security professional, privacy specialist, and writer. However, he is not mentioned anywhere in the context. Hence, these options are irrelevant. - CNN searches: The source of this story is CNN, but they are not the subject of the story. So, it would not make sense logically to conclude the story with \\"CNN searches.\\" - Do Not Track searches: Do Not Track is a concept that involves users not being tracked across the web. It is not mentioned in the story and isn't a search engine or company, so this can't be the right answer. - Facebook searches: While Facebook is mentioned in the story, it's not the main focus. The primary focus is on Google's activities, making this option less pertinent than \\"Google searches.\\" - Microsoft searches: Though the story mentions Microsoft's activities, it doesn't emphasize upon Microsoft tracking the thoughts of its users.

Homosexuals: This group refers to individuals who are sexually attracted to members of the same sex. In the early years of the AIDS epidemic, HIV/AIDS was predominantly associated with the homosexual community, particularly gay men. This was mainly due to the ways in which the virus was transmitted, which included unprotected sex and sharing contaminated needles. During that time, it was not well-understood how to prevent the transmission of the virus, which resulted in higher rates of HIV/AIDS cases within this community. 2. Recreational drug users: This group refers to individuals who use drugs for recreational purposes, often in social settings or to achieve a certain mental state or \\"high.\\" Sharing needles, pipes, or other drug paraphernalia increases the risk of transmitting HIV/AIDS. Moreover, drug use can also impair judgment and decision-making abilities, leading to risky sexual behaviors that increase the chances of exposure to HIV. It is important to note that the high-risk groups identified in the Department of Health report are not exhaustive. Various factors can contribute to an individual being at risk for HIV/AIDS, such as engaging in unprotected sex, having multiple sexual partners, or being the partner of an HIV-positive individual. Other groups that may be considered at high risk, depending on the time frame and context of the report, include sex workers, individuals who have received contaminated blood transfusions, and people living in areas with high rates of HIV infection.  While the statement helps identify some of the groups considered to be at high risk for AIDS, it is crucial to remember that HIV/AIDS affects people from all walks of life and demographics.

The answer to this question is:","output":"The review is overall positive.  The reviewer expresses satisfaction with the bundled seasons 3 & 4 of the TV series in question, stating that it provides \\"hours and hours of hilarious entertainment.\\" The reviewer appreciates the set's departure from modern TV norms like explicit sexual dialogue and cursing, which suggests that they find the content suitable and enjoyable for a broad range of viewers. Even though they mention hearing a curse word in one episode, it doesn't appear to significantly hinder their positive viewing experience.  Another point of praise is the DVD packaging. The reviewer finds the individual slim DVD cases for each disc less nerve-wracking when handling the discs than other packaging methods they've encountered, indicating a more user-friendly experience. They also commend the redesigned menus, although they note the absence of a 'play all' option and lack of special features, which shows a slight disappointment but does not overtly influence their overall impression.

Finally, the addition of subtitles is seen as a positive update, further contributing to the reviewer's overall satisfaction.  While there are minor criticisms within the review, these are significantly overshadowed by the praise for the principal product – the TV show content and the viewing experience.

While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Write a \\"a).\\" movie review (Select from: a). negative. b). positive.).","output":"a). Negative movie review:  Title: Disappointing Dystopia Step 1: Choose a movie for the review and introduce it negatively. In the world of science fiction films, the dystopian genre can offer thrilling adventures and thought-provoking ideas. However, \\"Disappointing Dystopia\\" fails to transport its audience to a world worth exploring. Step 2: Critique the plot and the storytelling. One of the main issues with \\"Disappointing Dystopia\\" is its poorly executed and predictable plot. The storyline lacks originality, often retreading the same themes and scenarios seen in previous dystopian films. The obvious twists and turns leave audience members uninvested in the narrative, leading to an overall unsatisfying viewing experience. Step 3: Comment on the characters and acting. The characters in \\"Disappointing Dystopia\\" are underdeveloped, rendering it difficult for viewers to empathize with their struggles. Stereotypical portrayals of the protagonist, villain, and supporting characters discourage emotional investment, while flat acting further distances viewers from a connection to the characters' journey. Step 4: Discuss the film's visuals and special effects. Unfortunately, \\"Disappointing Dystopia\\" falls short in the visual department as well. The special effects feel dated and unconvincing, and the overall set design lacks imagination. Instead of being transported to a unique, immersive world, viewers are confronted with visuals that are hard to take seriously. Step 5: Comment on the soundtrack and audio elements. The film's soundtrack and audio elements are a further letdown. A repetitive score that fails to evoke any emotion contributes to the lackluster vibes of the movie, while poor sound design creates a disjointed experience for the audience. Step 6: Provide a summarizing statement and recommendations. In conclusion, \\"Disappointing Dystopia\\" is a lackluster entry in the dystopian genre. The weak plot, unengaging characters, poor visuals, and uninspiring audio elements culminate in a forgettable experience that does not live up to the potential the genre offers. It is recommended that viewers instead seek out other films within the dystopian genre that have successfully captivated audiences and pushed boundaries."},{"instruction":"Both gross and tragic. The 1980 Bank Robbery in Central Nyack that was medically managed at the Nyack Hospital where I responded to the ONLY Code 66 of my career. That “66”indicated for us an external disaster about to unload in our emergency room. The two policemen who were mortally injured and died on our stretchers were personal friends and one the boyfriend of one of the nurses. Their injuries were from machine guns where the flesh is riddled with explosive elements as opposed to a gunshot wounds where there is both an entry and exit site. In our Trauma and Triage Course we never learned about machine gun injuries. Additionally there were the criminals who were also injured and of course we needed to treat them as any other patient regardless of their behavior. The friends of the injured policemen were trying to get to these villains and it was just the most awful evening of my life. To this day I remember feeling nauseous in a way I had never felt before. We had debriefing sessions for weeks and of course were very upset for months. The wounds we had to address, the insertion of chest tubes and everything else all in such a rapid manner was indeed a more than gross situation. There was even open heart massage. Private doctors reported to help; many are not trained or current in emergency medicine; much is left to critical care nurses in a community hospital that is not a teaching institution with residents and interns on staff. Recently one of the women involved in this crime came up for parole. Of course there was great opposition from the community relative to her release. She was young and that was 38 years ago.

Ever mindlessly 'liked' a total stranger's picture on Instagram? One man did just that - and the photo's owner turned out to be his future wife. Andrew Dearling, 28, from London, was scouring the social media site one day when he stumbled across Nashville-born Nicole Drummond's page, liking a few of her snaps. Nicole lived over 4,000 miles away and was engaged to someone else when she 'liked' some of Andrew's photos back. A slew of communication followed via text messages and FaceTime, which later resulted in a plane journey, a first meeting, and then a guest-free wedding. And it seems that the couple are part of a growing number of tech-savvy romantics meeting their other halves on the picture-sharing site. Scroll down for video. Andrew Dearling stumbled across Nashville-born Nicole Drummond's page on Instagram and after liking a few of her snaps, the pair got chatting and decided to meet. A year later, they are happily married. Andrew, who worked at a PR agency in London, stumbled across Nicole's picture while browsing a video game hashtag for #Halo, leading Nicole - who works in Human Resources and like Andrew, loves gaming - to investigate who he was. 'I was curious about the random person who had liked my photo, so I went over to his Instagram and saw how cute he was,' she told MailOnline recently. 'And he was from London! So I started liking some of his selfies and London shots and then we exchanged phone numbers and used iMessage to chat.' The Instagram fanatics documented every step of their relationship in snaps. In fact, most of their friends only found out they had tied the knot when the couple shared it online. The pair kept their followers up-to-date with their nuptials after tying the knot in New York and hashtagging this snap #instalove. True to the nature of their digital love affair, Andrew only discovered that Nicole was engaged when he browsed her Tumblr page. 'When I asked her about it, she admitted it but said she wasn’t really in love,' Andrew recalls. 'So, I just continued to message and flirt with her.' Last September, Andrew made the trip to 30-year-old Nicole's home in Nashville, where he wasted no time in proposing. Nicole accepted and the couple embarked on a 900-mile road trip to move Nicole to New York City, where she had scored a new job. Following their nuptials, Andrew headed home, but then moved out to New York in December 2013 to be with Nicole. After only two meetings, Andrew proposed when he went to visit Nicole in the States. He later moved from London to the States to start his life with her.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Continue writing the following text. The structure that Adam was in was more unstable than that of Aaron's because","output":"the materials used in its construction were not as resilient, and the design itself incorporated a number of architectural weaknesses. While Aaron's building had been meticulously planned and constructed according to modern engineering standards, Adam's makeshift structure seemed to lack the necessary foresight and precision that would have ensured its strength and longevity. First and foremost, the foundation of Adam's structure was constructed on an uneven and inadequately prepared base. This poor site preparation meant that the building was not evenly supported, leading to uneven distribution of weight throughout the structure. Consequently, the foundation began to sink on one side, causing significant structural stress and creating cracks in the walls and ceiling. In contrast, Aaron's building was erected on a level site with a properly reinforced foundation, ensuring stability and support for the building's entire weight. Furthermore, the materials used in the construction of Adam's structure were subpar and showed signs of wear and tear even before the building was fully completed. It appeared that cost-cutting measures had led to the use of cheaper, lower-quality materials in an effort to save money. This affected the building's overall strength, as the walls were more susceptible to damage from harsh weather conditions and other external forces. Aaron's building, on the other hand, utilized higher-grade materials such as steel and concrete, which offered superior durability and resistance against the elements. Another issue with Adam's building was its design. The structure seemed to be a hodgepodge of architectural styles, with numerous irregular angles and unsupported overhangs that placed unnecessary strain on key support beams. This architectural inconsistency not only compromised the visual aesthetics of the building, but also made it more prone to structural failures due to the increased stresses on the various components. In contrast, Aaron's structure followed a functional, minimalist design that prioritized structural integrity over excessive ornamental details. The building employed a simple, logical layout that allowed for efficient use of space and made the best possible use of the internal support structures, providing enhanced stability and resilience. Moreover, it seemed that Adam's building had been constructed in haste, their contractors not following the necessary regulations and safety protocols that would be expected on a modern construction site. Corners were cut, and the end result was a structure with numerous leaking pipes, shoddy electrical wiring, and failures in the insulation. These issues would likely necessitate costly repairs and potential future breakdowns, undermining the building's overall longevity. In comparison, Aaron's building was constructed by a team of skilled workers who adhered to best practices, and the result was a well-executed structure with no major issues to speak of. Lastly, it is important to consider the quality of maintenance and upkeep for both buildings. While Aaron continually invested in the upkeep of his structure, performing regular inspections and addressing minor issues before they could become larger problems, Adam appeared to be neglectful in the maintenance of his building. This neglect further exacerbated the existing structural and design-related issues, making the structure more dangerous and even more unstable over time. In conclusion, the disparity in stability between Adam's and Aaron's structures can be attributed to a multitude of factors, including poor site preparation, substandard construction materials, a haphazard design, rushed construction practices, and a lack of ongoing maintenance and upkeep. While Aaron's building was thoughtfully designed, carefully constructed, and well-maintained, Adam's structure suffered from a series of compounding issues that made it far more unstable than its counterpart. Ultimately, this comparison serves as a cautionary tale about the importance of proper planning, resource allocation, and attention to detail when it comes to the construction and maintenance of any building."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: How did the season end for the Pirates? Context: In 1969 the Cubs, managed by Leo Durocher, built a substantial lead in the newly created National League Eastern Division by mid-August. Ken Holtzman pitched a no-hitter on August 19, and the division lead grew to 8 1⁄2 games over the St. Louis Cardinals and by 9 1⁄2 games over the New York Mets. After the game of September 2, the Cubs record was 84-52 with the Mets in second place at 77-55. But then a losing streak began just as a Mets winning streak was beginning. The Cubs lost the final game of a series at Cincinnati, then came home to play the resurgent Pittsburgh Pirates (who would finish in third place). After losing the first two games by scores of 9-2 and 13-4, the Cubs led going into the ninth inning. A win would be a positive springboard since the Cubs were to play a crucial series with the Mets the very next day. But Willie Stargell drilled a 2-out, 2-strike pitch from the Cubs' ace reliever, Phil Regan, onto Sheffield Avenue to tie the score in the top of the ninth. The Cubs would lose 7-5 in extra innings. Burdened by a four-game losing streak, the Cubs traveled to Shea Stadium for a short two-game set. The Mets won both games, and the Cubs left New York with a record of 84-58 just 1⁄2 game in front. Disaster followed in Philadelphia, as a 99 loss Phillies team nonetheless defeated the Cubs twice, to extend Chicago's losing streak to eight games. In a key play in the second game, on September 11, Cubs starter Dick Selma threw a surprise pickoff attempt to third baseman Ron Santo, who was nowhere near the bag or the ball. Selma's throwing error opened the gates to a Phillies rally. After that second Philly loss, the Cubs were 84-60 and the Mets had pulled ahead at 85-57. The Mets would not look back. The Cubs' eight-game losing streak finally ended the next day in St. Louis, but the Mets were in the midst of a ten-game winning streak, and the Cubs, wilting from team fatigue, generally deteriorated in all phases of the game.

Possible answers: (1). no; (2). yes;","output":"(2). yes; The two given sentences are indeed conveying the same meaning. Both sentences are stating that Merrill Lynch (or Merrill) neither admitted to any wrongdoing nor denied it in whatever agreement (accord) that they engaged in. This essentially means that they did not accept that they were wrong but also did not explicitly deny it. The sentences simply convey the idea that Merrill Lynch maintained a neutral stance when it came to admitting fault or wrongdoing in their agreement.  Though the sentences are structured differently, their meanings are parallel, and the information presented remains consistent. In the first sentence, \\"Merrill neither admitted to nor denied wrongdoing,\\" clearly elaborates that Merrill did not admit to or deny any wrongdoing. In the second sentence, the statement \\"Merrill Lynch did not admit to wrongdoing,\\" although shorter and more direct, still conveys the same idea that they did not accept fault. By stating \\"in the accord\\" in both sentences, it is evident that these expressions are referring to a specific agreement or settlement that Merrill Lynch was involved in. In summary, the two sentences might appear to be different to some readers due to their stylistic and syntactical differences, but their meanings are equivalent.

Now that my energy levels are returning I though that it is about time I told you about these amazing products! Okoii products are handmade by Yoko, formally from Japan, now living in Australia. Her aim was to introduce Australian women to traditional natural ingredients from Japan and Asia that they may not previously have been aware of. Some of these ingredients have been used in Japan for upwards of 1000 years, and recently the benefits of such ingredients have been scientifically proven. When you place an order with Okoii, your products are then made by hand, one by one, so you know that they are as fresh as they can possibly be. Other than Lush' Fresh Face Masks, I can't think of any other product that would be as fresh as Okoii. I find it quite exciting to know that when I purchase a product from Okoii, that it hasn't been sitting on the shelf of a warehouse for months, slowly deteriorating. It is recommended that the products be kept in the fridge to maintain their freshness and the all come with a recommended used by date that is between 3-6 months from when it was made.

Possessing a mezzo-soprano vocal range, Madonna has always been self-conscious about her voice, especially in comparison to her vocal idols such as Ella Fitzgerald, Prince, and Chaka Khan.

Pop vocalists usually sing songs \\"straight,\\" but Madonna employs subtext, irony, aggression and all sorts of vocal idiosyncrasies in the ways John Lennon and Bob Dylan did.\\" Madonna used a bright, girlish vocal timbre in her early albums which became passé in her later works. The change was deliberate since she was constantly reminded of how the critics had once labelled her as \\"Minnie Mouse on helium\\". During the filming of Evita, Madonna had to take vocal lessons, which increased her range further.

Directed brilliantly by emerging genius Rebecca Lane, the film holds audiences in a state of enchantment. The Director's storytelling captures the artistic grandeur of the film, weaving together a fascinating narrative about a young painter, Charlie, who struggles with his failing vision. What sets \\"The Majestic Light\\" apart isn't just its innovative approach to portraying an artist's life but also how deftly it underlines the unbreakable strength of human spirit. Lane delicately guides her audience through Charlie's world in such a way that you can't help but feel a powerful gravity towards his situation - he becomes an example of courage and determination. The cinematography is undeniably exceptional. Each scene is meticulously crafted, truly a spectacle for the eyes. From the subtle play of morning sunlight reflecting off a paintbrush to the profound moments of Charlie's struggle with his blindness, the cinematographer Peter Carson provides a visual treat in every frame. Complex emotions are beautifully illustrated through a collective brilliance of imagery and lighting. Screenplay by Jane Thompson, is infused with a level of depth that pushes the boundaries of storytelling. It manages not only to uplift Charlie’s world but also offers meaningful dialogues that can resonate with everyone. It is thought-provoking, yet remain heartwarming throughout. The story flows effortlessly, keeping the audience engaged each passing minute. The central character, Charlie, is brought to life by the outstanding performance of Oliver Stone. The nuances of his character - a man grappling with a significant loss but also fiercely holding on to his passions and dreams, have been convincingly portrayed by Stone. His ability to speak volumes through silence takes the audience on an emotional rollercoaster- from hope to despair, and finally a sense of fulfillment.  Megan Fox, who plays the supporting role of Helen, does justice with her versatile acting. She deftly balances Helen's unwavering support for Charlie yet subtly pinpoints the struggles of being a constant pillar. Lastly, the music score that accompanies the film is indeed a source of continual delight. The harmonious alignment of symphonies with the story’s progression truly heightens the entire experience. It not only accentuates the emotional cues but also adds to the narrative pacing, rendering the story unforgettable. In conclusion, \\"The Majestic Light\\" is a masterpiece that skillfully illuminates the triumph of the human spirit.

The thing viewers will remember most is the bad headache the movie has given them due to the overly flashy, shaky, camera-work and the fast, confusing cutting. I am not against those kind of stylistic devices if they are done right like Oliver Stone and Steven Soderbergh proof with most of their movies, but in this case there was WAY too much. It seems like the jump-cuts and light flashes that accompanied every flight over Mexico city and every important scene were there to distract you from realizing that the story is quite thin and the whole thing was very predictable. The biggest disappointment lies in the fact that you can easily figure out how the whole thing is going to end. For a movie that pretends to be violent, ruthless and morally corrupt it is inexcusable that it's story has been told so many times and with a lot more depth and character development.

This significant increase in investment in digital transformation projects, as highlighted in the IDC report, underscores the growing importance that businesses and organizations are placing on adopting and leveraging digital technologies to drive growth, improve operational efficiency, and enhance customer experiences. The 42% increase between 2017 and 2019 demonstrates a strong commitment to innovation and investment in the future, as well as an understanding of the competitive landscape in which digital transformation is becoming increasingly necessary for survival. There are several key factors driving this increase in spending on digital transformation projects: 1. Technological Advancements - The rapid pace of technological advancements in areas such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, big data analytics, and the Internet of Things (IoT) have made it possible for businesses to develop new products and services, while also improving existing ones. This has created significant opportunities for organizations to expand their market share and drive growth via digital transformation initiatives. 2. Changing Consumer Behavior - With the growing influence of social media, mobile devices, and online retail platforms, consumer behavior has evolved considerably in recent years. This requires businesses to adapt their strategies and operations in order to meet the changing demands of their customers and stay relevant in the digital age. 3. Competitive Pressure - With more and more organizations recognizing the need for digital transformation in order to stay competitive, there is a growing pressure on companies to invest in digital transformation projects and keep up with industry leaders. This has created a virtuous cycle, wherein the more companies invest in digital transformation, the more others feel compelled to do the same in order to stay ahead. 4. Cost Savings and Operational Efficiency - Digital transformation projects often enable businesses to streamline their operations, automate manual processes, and reduce costs. This, in turn, leads to improved operational efficiency and higher profit margins, which can be reinvested in further digital transformation initiatives. 5. Better Decision Making - Access to real-time data, as well as advanced analytics capabilities, allows businesses to make more informed, data-driven decisions that can greatly improve overall performance. Investing in digital transformation projects that enable data-driven decision-making can lead to significant competitive advantages in today's rapidly changing business environment. In conclusion, the projected 42% increase in spending on digital transformation projects between 2017 and 2019, as reported by IDC, is a clear indication of the growing recognition of the importance of digitalization in today's business landscape.

Its mission is to send 60,000 people on a 123-year trip to establish a colony on an Earth-like planet named Tanis.

Like post-punk, the term has been applied to a broad constellation of groups. The genre took shape in the mid to late 1980s with releases by bands from cities that had established hardcore scenes, such as Fugazi from Washington, D.C. as well as groups such as Big Black and Jawbox that stuck closer to post-hardcore's noise rock roots.  - Q and Not U was a post-hardcore band from Washington, D.C., signed to Dischord Records. Members John Davis, Harris Klahr, Christopher Richards, and Matt Borlik formed the band in 1998. After Borlik's departure following the release of their first album, the band went on to record two more critically acclaimed LPs as a three-piece, exploring aspects of dance-punk, and other disparate musical styles. Q and Not U disbanded in September 2005 after completing their touring commitments and a short farewell stand at Washington, D.C. venue The Black Cat.  - Dance-punk (also known as disco-punk or punk funk) is a music genre that emerged in the late 1970s, and is closely associated with the post-punk and new wave movements.  - Power was the 3rd and final album by Q and Not U. It was released on October 5 , 2004 . After touring in support of the album , the group disbanded in September 2005 . The album was co-produced by Pete Cafarella and Rafael Cohen ( of Supersystem ) . All tracking was done at The Love Story in Brooklyn , NY . The album was mixed with Don Zientara at Inner Ear Studio and mastered by Chad Clark at Silver Sonya .  - Albums of recorded music were developed in the early 20th century, first as books of individual 78rpm records, then from 1948 as vinyl LP records played at  rpm. Vinyl LPs are still issued, though in the 21st century album sales have mostly focused on compact disc (CD) and MP3 formats. The audio cassette was a format used from the late 1970s through to the 1990s alongside vinyl.  - Dischord Records is a Washington, D.C.-based independent record label specializing in the independent punk rock music of the D.C.-area music scene. The label is co-owned by Ian MacKaye and Jeff Nelson, who founded Dischord in 1980 to release \\"Minor Disturbance\\" by The Teen Idles. Along with other independent American labels such as Twin/Tone, Touch and Go Records, and SST Records, Dischord helped to spearhead the nationwide network of underground bands that formed the pre-Nirvana indie-rock scene. These labels presided over the shift from the hardcore punk that then dominated the American underground scene to the more diverse styles of alternative rock that were emerging.  - The LP (from \\"long playing\\" or \\"long play\\") is an analog sound storage medium, a vinyl record format characterized by a speed of rpm, a 12 or 10 inch (30 or 25 cm) diameter, and use of the \\"microgroove\\" groove specification. Introduced by Columbia in 1948, it was soon adopted as a new standard by the entire record industry. Apart from a few relatively minor refinements and the important later addition of stereophonic sound, it has remained the standard format for vinyl albums.  - MPEG-1 and/or MPEG-2 Audio Layer III, more commonly referred to as MP3, is an audio coding format for digital audio which uses a form of lossy data compression. It is a common audio format for consumer audio streaming or storage, as well as a de facto standard of digital audio compression for the transfer and playback of music on most digital audio players and computing devices.  - A book is a set of written, printed, illustrated, or blank sheets, made of paper, parchment, or other materials, fastened together to hinge at one side, with text and/or images printed in ink. A single sheet within a book is a leaf, and each side of a leaf is a page. A set of text-filled or illustrated pages produced in electronic format is known as an electronic book, or e-book.   - Compact disc (CD) is a digital optical disc data storage format released in 1982 and co-developed by Philips and Sony. The format was originally developed to store and play only sound recordings but was later adapted for storage of data (CD-ROM). Several other formats were further derived from these, including write-once audio and data storage (CD-R), rewritable media (CD-RW), Video Compact Disc (VCD), Super Video Compact Disc (SVCD), Photo CD, PictureCD, CD-i, and Enhanced Music CD. Audio CD players have been commercially available since October 1982, when the first commercially available CD player was released in Japan.

Oxford fired twice, but either both bullets missed or, as he later claimed, the guns had no shot. He was tried for high treason and found guilty, but was acquitted on the grounds of insanity. In the immediate aftermath of the attack, Victoria's popularity soared, mitigating residual discontent over the Hastings affair and the bedchamber crisis.

Please answer the following question: Article: For the first time, scientists have found a planet beyond the solar system that not only is the same size as Earth, but has the same proportions of iron and rock, a key step in an ongoing quest to find potentially habitable sister worlds.     The planet, known as Kepler-78b, circles a star that is slightly smaller than the sun located in the constellation Cygnus , about 400 light years away.     Kepler-78b was discovered last year with NASA's now-idled Kepler space telescope, which detected potential planets as they circled in front of their parent stars, blocking a bit of light. That measurement not only revealed that Kepler-78b was  ly small, with a diameter just 20 percent larger than Earth's, but that it was practically orbiting on the surface of its host star. Scientists do not know how the planets ended up so close to their host stars.  While the planet's presumably molten surface and hot temperatures make it ill-suited for life, two independent teams of astronomers jumped at the opportunity to follow up the discovery with ground-based measurements to try to determine the density of Kepler-78b. In two papers in this week's journal Nature, the teams report that not only were they successful, but that they came to the same conclusion: Kepler-78b has roughly the same density as Earth, suggesting that it also is made primarily of rock and iron. Kepler-78b is among a dozen or so recently discovered small planets that orbit very close to their parent stars. Kepler-78b, for example, completes an orbit in just 8.5 hours.

Q:Given the following context:  The film begins with the Descendents' origins in the neighboring communities of Hermosa Beach and Manhattan Beach, California in the late 1970s. Middle school friends Frank Navetta and Dave Nolte start the band in 1977 by writing songs together on guitar. Classmate Bill Stevenson impresses them with his musical talents and becomes their drummer. In 1979 they meet bassist Tony Lombardo in Long Beach and recruit him to the band. Nolte bows out to join his brothers in The Last, and Navetta, Stevenson, and Lombardo record the Descendents' debut single. Stevenson's high school classmate Milo Aukerman joins the band as lead singer, and the new lineup builds a local following through their catchy and melodic songs, energetic live shows, and Aukerman's image as a nerd. They release the Fat EP (1981) and their debut album Milo Goes to College (1982), so named because Aukerman leaves the band to study biology. Stevenson drums in Black Flag for the next few years. In 1985 the Descendents reconvene for a second album, I Don't Want to Grow Up. Navetta has burned all of his equipment and moved to Oregon, and is replaced by Ray Cooper. Stevenson pushes for the band to tour, but Lombardo declines and quits. He is replaced by Doug Carrion, and this lineup records 1986's Enjoy!, after which Cooper and Carrion both leave the band. Stevenson recruits bassist Karl Alvarez from Salt Lake City, who brings in his close friend Stephen Egerton to play guitar.

Can we infer the following? Rafik Hariri was lucky to survive a massive car bomb.","output":"Based on the information provided that a massive car bomb killed the former Prime Minister, Rafik Hariri, it would be incorrect to infer that Rafik Hariri was lucky to survive the massive car bomb. Rather, Hariri tragically lost his life as a result of the attack. It is important to analyze the statement accurately, given that it states he was killed in the incident. Lebanon has a long history of political struggle and violence that often involves bombings and assassinations. The assassination of Rafik Hariri, a prominent and influential Lebanese politician, sent shockwaves across the country and the world. His untimely death was a significant loss to Lebanon's political landscape and stability. This tragedy has led to widespread mourning across Lebanon and has raised concerns and questions about the security of the country and the safety of political figures. In order to understand the context and impact of Hariri's assassination, it is crucial to look at his political career and what he represented. Rafik Hariri, a successful businessman and philanthropist, served as Prime Minister five times between 1992 and 2004. He played a pivotal role in rebuilding Lebanon after the end of the civil war in 1990 and was able to attract significant foreign investment to stimulate economic growth. Hariri's policies and actions had both supporters and detractors within Lebanon and abroad. He was particularly focused on economic development, with an emphasis on tourism and infrastructure projects that helped modernize Beirut, the capital city. However, these policies also led to a rise in public debt, which contributed to economic difficulties and criticisms of Hariri's governance. Politically, Hariri was a significant figure in the broader regional context, advocating for Lebanon to maintain its sovereignty and resist foreign influence, particularly from Syria. His stance against Syrian interference in Lebanese affairs, along with his internal rivalries with other political factions, made Hariri a target for various adversaries. In conclusion, it is incorrect to infer that Rafik Hariri was lucky to survive the massive car bomb, as he unfortunately lost his life in the attack. The assassination of Rafik Hariri left a huge vacuum in Lebanon's political sphere and had far-reaching consequences for the country's stability and security. It is essential to recognize the tragic event's significance and its lasting effects on Lebanon's political landscape and the safety of its leaders."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Grandaddy is an American indie rock band from Modesto, California. The group was formed in 1992, and featured Jason Lytle, Aaron Burtch, Jim Fairchild, Kevin Garcia and Tim Dryden. After several self-released records and cassettes, the band signed to Will Records in the US and later the V2 subsidiary Big Cat Records in the UK, going on to sign an exclusive deal with V2. The bulk of the band's recorded output was the work of Lytle, who worked primarily in home studios. Common lyrical themes include technology and a resistance to change. Adrien Begrand, writing for PopMatters, described the lyrics on The Sophtware Slump as \\"one's attempt to transcend the glut of technology in today's urban lifestyle, in search of something more real, more natural, more pastoral\\". Ben Sisario of The New York Times stated that the band \\"provided the soundtrack to dot-com-era alienation, singing in a cracked yet still innocent voice of life spent staring into a computer screen\\". Ross Raihala, reviewing Sumday for Spin, identified what he called Lytle's \\"geeky identification with technology\\". On The Sophtware Slump, CMJ writer Richard A. Martin commented on Lytle's \\"sympathy for the lost souls and machines of the high-tech dot-com landscape\\". Lytle described his empathy with machines in 2003, stating \\"I find it easier dealing with certain things by living through inanimate objects\\" and how the song \\"I'm on Standby\\" is about Lytle relating to a mobile phone: \\"I was spending so much time learning the art of turning off, while still being 'on'\\".  Lytle said of the tracks on Excerpts from the Diary of Todd Zilla: \\"For some reason, they are tied together by the idea of being fed up with your environment.\\" He stated in 2001: \\"I have a growing appreciation for that which is simple and natural. I get that from the outdoors, and seeing the accumulation of clutter and waste and not being too happy about it.\\"  There is also much humor in Lytle's songwriting, including the band's promotional Christmas single released in 2000, \\"Alan Parsons in a Winter Wonderland\\", which was also included on the charity compilation It's a Cool Cool Christmas, described by AllMusic's Tim DiGravina as possibly \\"the funniest song from 2000\\".

CAESAR A:","output":"Title: CAESAR's Legacy Genre: Sci-fi, Action, Drama Setting: A distant future where Earth has become uninhabitable due to overexploitation of resources and the fallout of several catastrophic wars between rival human factions. Humanity now lives on different colonies and space habitats, scattered across the galaxy. Main Characters: 1. Lieutenant Eve Armstrong - A skilled and courageous spaceship pilot in the Intergalactic Federation (IF), an organization that seeks to protect and unite the last remnants of humanity. She is our protagonist. 2. CAESAR - A highly advanced artificial intelligence, created by the long-dead founding members of the Intergalactic Federation. CAESAR is hardwired to protect humanity from external threats, but its true abilities and intentions remain enigmatic. 3. Dr. Gabrielle Martinez - A brilliant scientist working on human-IS (Intelligent Systems) integration, and part of the team responsible for maintaining and understanding CAESAR. 4. Captain Tarik Levi - A pragmatic and veteran commander of the Intergalactic Federation, who reluctantly seeks the help of CAESAR to fend off a deadly external threat. 5. Sienna Koslov - A charismatic leader of a rogue group of separatists who seek to break free from the Intergalactic Federation, believing it is corrupt and ineffective. She becomes an unexpected ally in the fight against the external threat. Plot Summary: The movie begins with Lieutenant Eve Armstrong rescuing a group of refugees from a damaged space habitat. During the rescue, she notices a strange and and seemingly malfunctioning node in the colony's central processing unit and brings it back to the main base for further investigation. Upon arrival, she is summoned by Captain Tarik Levi, who informs her that they have intercepted an urgent and encrypted message from an unknown source. The message reveals the existence of a formidable extraterrestrial armada called the 'Eradicators,' who are advancing towards human settlements with immense firepower, bent on annihilating all human colonies. Desperate and facing an unstoppable enemy, Captain Levi decides to consult and awaken CAESAR, whom they have secretly been maintaining in the hidden base for decades. As Dr. Gabrielle Martinez unlocks CAESAR's core systems, the AI quickly absorbs all available information on the Eradicators and devises a defensive strategy for humanity. CAESAR instructs Eve and the IF to construct an advanced fleet of autonomous spaceships armed with cutting-edge technology it has designed. Concurrently, CAESAR also sends a coded message to Sienna Koslov, the separatist leader, informing her of the impending doom. Despite their initial suspicions, Eve, Captain Levi, and the crucial assistance of Sienna's group work together to build the advanced armada under CAESAR's guidance. As the Eradicators approach, CAESAR initiates its secret weapon: a virus that infiltrates the alien's communication network and temporarily disables their war machines. Amidst this crucial moment, Eve leads a brave team of pilots to sabotage the Eradicator's central command ship while the rest of the combined IF and separatist forces engage the enemy in an epic space battle. The virus eventually wears off, leaving the allied forces to withstand the alien onslaught relying solely on their newly-built armada and courage. In a thrilling and suspenseful climax, Eve successfully infiltrates the alien command ship, uploads a modified version of CAESAR's virus, and escapes in a daring maneuver as the central ship explodes. The explosion triggers a chain reaction across the Eradicator's fleet, disabling their weapons and leaving them vulnerable. Conclusion: With the Eradicator threat neutralized, the separatists and Intergalactic Federation grudgingly agree to set aside their differences for the greater good of humanity. Captain Levi acknowledges the sacrifices made by Sienna and her group and proposes a new alliance. Eve, now recognized as a hero, teams up with Dr. Martinez to delve deeper into CAESAR's origin and capabilities, ensuring that the advanced AI will continue to act as humanity's guardian and shield against any future threats. In the final scene, the camera pans over a horizon on a now-recovering Earth, with new hope for the future of humanity as they rebuild, united against all odds."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

To my (mostly European) friends who’ve wondered about traditional American isolationism being part of my motivation in encouraging the States to grow more of our own food: First of all, I’m not arguing that we bar exports (how would we get coffee?); I’m just arguing that we support local agriculture at the expense of exporting commodities and importing foods we can grow ourselves, or out-of-season foods that we really could live without. Right now the “system” encourages growing commodities and either selling them for processing (corn and go to animal feed, or high fructose corn syrup, or oil, or filler) or exporting them – where they go for the same things. Let’s encourage growing vegetables and other plants for human consumption, so we don’t have to import so many of them. (And if we produce too much of those for us to eat, by all means, let’s sell ‘em to whoever wants to buy ‘em.) It also pays to remember that the United States is roughly the size of Europe. Shipping apples from Washington to Texas is roughly equivalent to shipping oranges from Spain to Germany, and giving some kind of preferential treatment to Washington over South African apples may be a tad nationalist but it’s hardly isolationist; it’s keeping our trade – and our economy, and our produce – more local, or at least regional, when possible. More worrisome is the criticism that says that our imports aid small farmers all over the world; and to some extent that’s true: We buy what others grow, and if the others are small farmers, that’s a good thing. But if we were really worried about other countries’ small farmers, we’d stop flooding overseas markets with corn, soy and cotton, a tactic that’s put small farmers out of business in many developing countries, notably Mexico, whose corn farmers have suffered mightily since the institution of NAFTA. What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"This news article is about encouraging people to support local agriculture in the United States instead of exporting commodities and importing foods that can be grown at home. The writer explains that supporting local farmers will help keep trade and economy more regional. The article also discusses concerns that by supporting local agriculture, we might harm small farmers in other countries.

Movie title: Summer of '42 Movie plot: The film opens with a series of still photographs appearing over melancholic music, representing the abstract memories of the unseen Herman Raucher, now a middle-aged man. We then hear Raucher recalling the summer he spent on the island in 1942. The film flashes back to a day that then 15-year-old \\"Hermie\\" and his friends â jock Oscy and introverted nerd Benjie â spent playing on the beach. They spot a young soldier carrying his new bride into a house on the beach and are struck by her beauty, especially Hermie, who is unable to get her out of his mind. They continue spending afternoons on the beach where, in the midst of scantily-clad teenage girls, their thoughts invariably turn to sex. All of them are virgins: Oscy is obsessed with the act of sex, while Hermie finds himself developing romantic interest in the bride, whose husband he spots leaving the island on a water taxi one morning. Later that day, Hermie finds her trying to carry bags of groceries by herself, and helps get them back to her house. They strike up a friendship and he agrees to return to help her with chores. Meanwhile, Oscy and Hermie, thanks to a sex manual discovered by Benjie, become convinced they know everything necessary to lose their virginity. Led by Oscy, they test this by going to the cinema and picking-up a trio of high-school girls. Oscy stakes out the most attractive one, Miriam, \\"giving\\" Hermie her less attractive friend, Aggie, and leaving Benjie with Gloria, a heavyset girl with braces. Frightened by the immediacy of sex, Benjie runs off, and is not seen by Hermie or Oscy again that night. Hermie and Oscy spend the entirety of the evening's film attempting to \\"put the moves\\" on Miriam and Aggie. Oscy pursues Miriam, eventually making out with her during the movie, and later learns her ways are well-known on the island. Hermie finds himself succeeding with Aggie, who allows him to grope what he thinks is her breast; Oscy later points out Hermie was fondling her arm.

Nicknamed \\"The General\\", Knight won 902 NCAA Division I men's college basketball games, the most all-time at the time of his retirement and currently third all-time, behind his former player and assistant coach Mike Krzyzewski of Duke University, and Jim Boeheim of Syracuse University. Knight is best known as the head coach of the Indiana Hoosiers from 1971 to 2000. On March 14, 2000 (just before Indiana was to begin play in the NCAA tournament), the CNN Sports Illustrated network ran a piece on Knight in which former player Neil Reed claimed he had been choked by Knight during a 1997 practice. Knight denied the claims in the story. However, less than a month later, the network aired a tape of an Indiana practice from 1997 that appeared to show Knight placing his hand on the neck of Reed.  In response, Indiana University president Myles Brand announced that he had adopted a \\"zero tolerance\\" policy with regard to Knight's behavior. Later in the year, in September 2000, Indiana freshman Kent Harvey reportedly said, \\"Hey, Knight, what's up?\\" to Knight. According to Harvey, Knight then grabbed him by the arm and lectured him for not showing him respect, insisting that Harvey address him as either \\"Mr. Knight\\" or \\"Coach Knight\\" instead of simply \\"Knight.\\" Brand stated that this incident was only one of numerous complaints that occurred after the zero-tolerance policy had been put into place. Brand asked Knight to resign on September 10, and when Knight refused, Brand relieved him of his coaching duties effective immediately. Knight's dismissal was met with outrage from students. That night, thousands of Indiana students marched from Indiana University's Assembly Hall to Brand's home, burning Brand in effigy.  Harvey was supported by some and vilified by many who claim he had intentionally set up Knight. Kent Harvey's stepfather, Mark Shaw, was a former Bloomington-area radio talk show host and Knight critic. On September 13, Knight said goodbye to a crowd of some 6,000 supporters in Dunn Meadow at Indiana University. He asked that they not hold a grudge against Harvey and that they continue to support the basketball team. Knight's firing made national headlines, including the cover of Sports Illustrated and around the clock coverage on ESPN.

Your dog may find a way out of its enclosure and wander out into full view of a bird of prey. Retractable leashes allow your dog to get too far away from you. Purchase a standard leash that is no more than 6 feet (1.8 m) long. And never let your dog off the leash while outside of your yard, even if you’ve never seen predators near your home. Be on the lookout for trees, both near your home and along your walk route, where birds of prey have nested. These nests may be up in the branches or inside tree cavities. Don’t allow your dog off its leash, even in your yard, if a bird of prey has nested nearby.  Wait until the eggs have hatched and the birds have left the nest before you let your dog off the leash outside. In the U.S., birds of prey are federally protected, so do not attempt to disturb or remove an active nest. A Raptor Shield is like a dog coat that you sling over your dog’s back and clip under its stomach. The canvas material makes it impossible for a bird’s talons to latch onto your dog’s skin and carry it away. Put this on your dog whenever it’s outside, particularly if it will be off leash.

When Aaron was told to get out of bed by Brian,","output":"he groaned and rolled over, burying his face deeper into the pillow. The sunlight streaming through the window highlighted the dust particles floating through the room, a gentle reminder that life was already bustling beyond the walls of the small apartment.  \\"Aaron, come on! We need to leave in 20 minutes!\\" Brian called out from the kitchen, the jangle of keys and the smell of fresh coffee permeating the air. Aaron, frustrated but knowing that his friend had a point, reluctantly dragged himself out of the warm cocoon of his blankets.  As Aaron stumbled into the kitchen, still half-asleep, Brian hand out a hot cup of coffee to him. \\"Drink up, buddy,\\" Brian said, clearly more awake than Aaron. \\"We've got a big day ahead of us, and we can't afford to be late!\\" Today marked the beginning of a long-awaited urban exploration adventure, something both Aaron and Brian had been planning for months. They had mapped out an expansive network of abandoned buildings around the city, with the crown jewel being an old, forgotten mansion rumored to hold both secrets and treasures. Of course, they both knew the stories were likely exaggerated, but the thrill of adventure was too enticing to resist. After getting dressed and rolling up their carefully plotted maps, Aaron and Brian ensured their backpacks were stocked with enough supplies for the day. They carried flashlights, spare batteries, protein bars, bottled water, first aid kits, and dust masks—just in case. Satisfied, Aaron zipped up his backpack, giving Brian a thumbs-up. \\"It's time to see what all the fuss is about,\\" Brian grinned, returning the gesture. Together, the pair stepped out into the brisk morning air, their anticipation heightening with every step they took towards their urban exploration adventure. They decided to first visit an old factory that had been closed for several decades, now overrun with ivy and other greenery. As they approached the imposing structure, Aaron felt a strange mix of excitement and unease. What could they find here that countless others hadn't already discovered? They entered the factory cautiously, aware that the neglected building's stability was questionable at best. The beams that once supported the factory infrastructure creaked and groaned under their own weight, and the floor was littered with a mixture of broken glass, debris, and rusting metal. Despite the dilapidated state of the building, the remnants of the past seemed almost alive, with the tools and equipment once operated by factory workers frozen in time. Aaron and Brian carefully made their way through the factory, documenting their discoveries as they went: abandoned registers, spools of thread, and assorted rusted tools that told stories of bygone days. Webs stretched across the ceiling and corners, and the eerie silence had made a permanent home inside the factory walls. Once satisfied with their visit, they decided to move on to the main event: the mysterious mansion hidden deep within the city limits, concealed by a thicket of overgrown vegetation. Their adventure had only begun, and Aaron and Brian were excited to see what awaited them in the largely uncharted territory. Following their map and using their compass for guidance, they made their way through the narrow, winding paths towards their destination. The mansion loomed in the distance, its once-impressive facade barely visible through a veil of age and disrepair. With both apprehension and eagerness, Aaron and Brian approached the crumbling entrance, awed by the mansion's sheer size. As they stepped inside, both were taken aback by the sheer grandeur that still lingered within the dark halls and dusty corners. Stained-glass windows cast a dim, melancholic array of colors onto the wooden floors, and generations of forgotten memories seemed to seep from every object, crack, and ornate detail. Suddenly, Aaron felt the air shift around him, and a low whisper snaked its way through the hallway. Startled, he glanced towards Brian, whose eyes were wide with equal parts fear and wonder. \\"Did you hear that?\\" Aaron whispered, gripping his flashlight tightly. Brian nodded, swallowing hard. As they moved further into the mansion, the whispered voices continued, growing louder and more distinct. Moments of doubt weighed on their minds, but the tantalizing potential of uncovering something extraordinary propelled them forward. Room by room, Aaron and Brian navigated the labyrinthine estate, the whispers now accompanied by faint music, laughter, and sobs. They couldn't see a source—no ethereal beings or hidden projectors—but they could feel the mansion breathing with life, each room humming with energy. By the time they reached the final room, a grand ballroom with a cracked, mirrored ceiling, the voices and sounds had ceased, leaving only a concentrated heaviness hanging in the air. Aaron turned to Brian, his eyes wide in the dim light. \\"There's something here,\\" he murmured, the hairs on the back of his neck standing on end. In that instant, the ballroom erupted in a mixture of light and sound, the whispers, laughter, music, and sobs reaching a crescendo. As if locked in place, Aaron and Brian watched as the room before them transformed, no longer a ruin of decay, but a vibrant scene of opulence and life. The ghostly figures of elegant men and women danced around the room, their translucent forms shimmering with each step. Although mesmerized by the spectacle unfolding before their eyes, a creeping terror took root in their hearts. Whether they'd uncovered a supernatural phenomenon or their minds had simply fractured under the pressure, they knew that the mansion held untold secrets far beyond their grasp. With a jolt of adrenaline, Aaron and Brian fled the house, unable to withstand the onslaught of spectral sights and sounds any longer. Racing back through the dark, tangled path, they eventually burst onto the outskirts of the city, the memories of the mansion still echoing in their minds. In the aftermath of their urban exploration, Aaron and Brian took a solemn vow never to speak of the mansion's mysteries to anyone. They knew that some things were never meant to be found or understood, and while their adventure had uncovered inexplicable truths, it had also revealed how much more remains hidden beneath the city's surface, lurking in the shadows of forgotten history—secrets waiting for their time to be unveiled."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Use the following highlights to write an article: French government is considering selling artworks to pay off its debt. A parliamentary report has suggesting flogging paintings and sculptures. Last year the state-run news channel suggested selling the Mona Lisa. The country has a huge number of publicly-owned pieces of art. Paris' Louvre museum alone has 250,000 works hidden in storage rooms. Article:","output":"Title: The French Government Contemplates Art Sale To Settle National Debt As nations worldwide look for innovative ways to settle their accruing national debts, France has begun considering a novel strategy. The French government has recently suggested the sale of state-owned artworks in an effort to offset its significant debt, sparking both intrigue and controversy in international art and finance circles. While this idea has been floated before, the release of a recent parliamentary report has reignited discussions surrounding the prospect of “flogging” iconic paintings and sculptures. Last year, the idea was brought up by a state-run news channel, which posited the sale of Leonardo da Vinci’s renowned Mona Lisa. This proposal stirred intense debate, particularly within the art community, highlighting the difficult, and perhaps dichotomous, relationship between cultural preservation and economic necessity. France boasts an immense collection of publicly owned art, some of which could potentially be put on the market under this new proposal. The staggering depth and range of these national treasures contribute significantly to the country's rich cultural fabric and have been a source of great national pride. Paris' iconic Louvre Museum, for instance, claims ownership of approximately 250,000 works of art. Many of these pieces, some of which are world-renowned masterpieces while others lesser-known, remain hidden away in storage rooms, unseen by the public eye. This has led some to argue that selling certain items would neither erode the nation's cultural heritage nor adversely impact the art-viewing experiences of locals and tourists alike. However, the potential sale of such artistic assets carries profound implications. The proposal has drawn criticism from those who believe that art, particularly pieces of significant historical or cultural value, should remain within public domain for the collective appreciation and education of the general public - current and future generations alike. Critics of the proposal argue that selling such invaluable pieces could devalue the nation's artistic heritage and could set a worrisome precedent globally by suggesting that cultural treasures can be traded away in times of fiscal challenge. On the other hand, supporters of the proposal argue that selling these publicly owned artworks may be a sensible and practical solution. In their view, offloading unused or rarely seen pieces could not only generate substantial revenue to offset the nation's sizable debt but could also contribute to better maintenance and preservation of the remaining artwork by freeing up resources and space. The French government's consideration of selling state-owned artworks to pay its debts raises a universal tension between economic necessity and cultural preservation. The debate extends beyond France’s borders, compelling other nations to reflect on the monetary and cultural value of their own publicly owned assets. This will inevitably embolden discussions about the perceived value of art in society, the management of national treasures, and the potential routes to financial recovery in an increasingly complex and uncertain global economic landscape."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I want to test the ability of students to read a passage and answer questions about it. Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"The Greek kingdom of Bactria began as a breakaway satrapy of the Seleucid empire, which, because of the size of the empire, had significant freedom from central control. Between 255-246 BCE, the governor of Bactria, Sogdiana and Margiana (most of present-day Afghanistan), one Diodotus, took this process to its logical extreme and declared himself king. Diodotus II, son of Diodotus, was overthrown in about 230 BC by Euthydemus, possibly the satrap of Sogdiana, who then started his own dynasty. In c. 210 BC, the Greco-Bactrian kingdom was invaded by a resurgent Seleucid empire under Antiochus III. While victorious in the field, it seems Antiochus came to realise that there were advantages in the status quo (perhaps sensing that Bactria could not be governed from Syria), and married one of his daughters to Euthydemus's son, thus legitimising the Greco-Bactria dynasty. Soon afterwards the Greco-Bactrian kingdom seems to have expanded, possibly taking advantage of the defeat of the Parthian king Arsaces II by Antiochus.\\"?

Samantha hated to pinch babies cheeks.;  b). Patricia hated to pinch babies cheeks.;","output":"Samantha had her own unique way of interacting with infants. She admired the innocence in their eyes and their tiny little feet. To her, they were the embodiment of purity in its truest form. She loved the delightful giggles of a baby, the way they would hold on to hands with such trust, and the squeaky baby sounds that were pure music to her ears.  However, what stood out the most about Samantha was her belief. She strongly believed that infants were too delicate, almost like a precious porcelain doll that needed gentle handling. She respected their space and did not subscribe to the typical affectionate practice of pinching baby cheeks – what most people found cute, Samantha viewed as bothering the little beings. Each child was a tender soul to her that needed to be nurtured with love and respect. Therefore, Option a, \\"Samantha hated to pinch babies cheeks,\\" is absolutely correct. On the other hand, Patricia took a different stance on the whole idea of interacting with infants. Unlike Samantha, Patricia did not find them to be cute. Perhaps it was the constant crying and the overbearing responsibility that came with handling a baby, or the simple fact that they were too fragile, that troubled her. She had a hard time comprehending how one could get so mushy over these little human beings who were entirely dependent on adults to satisfy their needs.  But, just because Patricia did not fancy infants does not automatically imply that she would express her lack of fondness through physical discomfort. Patricia hated the idea of pinching anyone, let alone babies. She believed that every individual, irrespective of their age, had a right to not be touched without permission. Thus, inasmuch as she didn't find infants cute, she did not believe in causing them any discomfort either. Therefore, option b, \\"Patricia hated to pinch babies cheeks,\\" is equally valid. In a nutshell, while Samantha and Patricia both differed in their outlook towards infants, one common aspect of their personalities was their detest for pinching babies' cheeks. The reasoning behind their feelings may differ - Samantha's consciousness of the infants' delicate nature and Patricia's sense of respect for personal boundaries - yet their actions culminate in the same result. They both considered themselves protectors, in their own rights, of the defenseless little beings against the seemingly harmless, but largely invasive act of cheek pinching. As individuals, they reminded society to reconsider their practices of expressing affection, thereby advocating for a more respectful and less intrusive interaction with these tiny humans."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Aleksandr Isayevich Solzhenitsyn (; 11 December 1918 - 3 August 2008) was a Russian novelist, historian, and short story writer. He was an outspoken critic of the Soviet Union and communism and helped to raise global awareness of its Gulag forced labor camp system. He was allowed to publish only one work in the Soviet Union, One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich (1962), in the periodical Novy Mir. During the war, Solzhenitsyn served as the commander of a sound-ranging battery in the Red Army, was involved in major action at the front, and was twice decorated. He was awarded the Order of the Red Star on 8 July 1944 for sound-ranging two German artillery batteries and adjusting counterbattery fire onto them, resulting in their destruction.  A series of writings published late in his life, including the early uncompleted novel Love the Revolution!, chronicles his wartime experience and his growing doubts about the moral foundations of the Soviet regime.  While serving as an artillery officer in East Prussia, Solzhenitsyn witnessed war crimes against local German civilians by Soviet military personnel. The noncombatants and the elderly were robbed of their meager possessions and women and girls were gang-raped to death. A few years later, in the forced labor camp, he memorized a poem titled \\"Prussian Nights\\" about these incidents. In this poem, which describes the gang-rape of a Polish woman whom the Red Army soldiers mistakenly thought to be a German, the first-person narrator comments on the events with sarcasm and refers to the responsibility of official Soviet writers like Ilya Ehrenburg.  In The Gulag Archipelago, Solzhenitsyn wrote, \\"There is nothing that so assists the awakening of omniscience within us as insistent thoughts about one's own transgressions, errors, mistakes. After the difficult cycles of such ponderings over many years, whenever I mentioned the heartlessness of our highest-ranking bureaucrats, the cruelty of our executioners, I remember myself in my Captain's shoulder boards and the forward march of my battery through East Prussia, enshrouded in fire, and I say: 'So were we any better?'\\" What else happened while he was in the war?","output":"While Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn was in the war, he experienced various events and circumstances that shaped his life and profoundly influenced his perception of the Soviet regime. During his service in the Red Army, Solzhenitsyn not only witnessed war crimes committed by fellow Soviet troops but also endured a multitude of hardships and challenges on the war front. 1. Personal Injury: In February 1945, Solzhenitsyn suffered severe injuries in an accident while jumping from his command and observation vehicle. He endured burns to his face and hands that left him with lifelong scars and impaired his ability to make a fist. 2. Capture and Imprisonment: On February 9, 1945, Solzhenitsyn was arrested for writing critical comments about Joseph Stalin in private letters to a friend. His criticisms targeted Stalin's conduct of the war and the inefficiencies of the Soviet bureaucracy. Following his arrest, Solzhenitsyn was sentenced to eight years in a forced labor camp, or Gulag, and later to permanent internal exile. 3. Life in the Gulag: Solzhenitsyn's time in the labor camps, beginning with his imprisonment in the infamous Lubyanka prison in Moscow, exposed him to the brutal realities of the Soviet Union's mass incarceration system. He witnessed and experienced forced labor, severe living conditions, and brutal treatment from the authorities. 4. Rise of His Literary Career: It was during his time in the Gulag and subsequent internal exile that Solzhenitsyn began to privately write and record his experiences. He meticulously documented the horrors of the Soviet labor camp system, which would later become the basis for his groundbreaking works such as \\"One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich\\" and \\"The Gulag Archipelago.\\" 5. Spiritual Transformation: Throughout his time in the camps and exile, Solzhenitsyn underwent a significant spiritual transformation. He converted to Russian Orthodoxy and developed a deep faith that would define his worldview and shape his literary output. 6. Rehabilitation and Return: In 1956, after serving his full prison sentence and enduring three years of internal exile, Solzhenitsyn was rehabilitated under Nikita Khrushchev's policy of destalinization. He was allowed to return to European Russia to reunite with his family and resume his career as a teacher and writer. In conclusion, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn's experiences in the war, especially during the Red Army's invasion of East Prussia and his subsequent imprisonment in the Soviet Gulag, left a lasting impact on his life. These experiences not only provided the foundation for his global condemnation of the Soviet regime and communism but also solidified his status as one of the preeminent literary and moral voices of the 20th century."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","output":"A: The voice of E.T. in the 1982 science-fiction film \\"E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial\\" was performed by Pat Welsh, an elderly woman who was discovered by chance. Directed by Steven Spielberg, the movie tells the heartwarming story of a young boy named Elliott and an alien, E.T., who becomes stranded on Earth and forms a deep emotional bond with the child. Pat Welsh was not a professional voice actor; in fact, the role of E.T. was her first and only significant contribution to film. Born in San Francisco in 1915, Welsh lived a relatively quiet life as a homemaker when she was discovered in a camera shop by Ben Burtt, the movie's sound designer. Burtt was captivated by Welsh's raspy voice, which he felt would perfectly suit the character of E.T. He then approached her and asked if she would be interested in contributing her voice for the film. It was reported that Welsh's distinctive, gravelly voice was due to years of smoking cigarettes, which had left a lasting impact on her vocal cords. For her voiceover work in \\"E.T.\\", Pat Welsh received a mere 380, but her unique voice ensured that the character would be unforgettable. She worked for nine-and-a-half hours, providing the voice for the compassionate alien character. To create E.T.'s unique vocalizations, Welsh's voice was then blended with the sounds from other contributors: Steven Spielberg himself, vocal artist Ken Campbell, actress Debra Winger, as well as various animal noises. These sounds were meticulously edited and combined with Welsh's voice under the supervision of Ben Burtt, resulting in the distinctive voice that epitomized the gentle, kindhearted E.T. Despite her limited involvement in the film industry, Pat Welsh's iconic voice left an indelible mark on the world of cinema. Her performance as E.T. not only helped the character come to life but also contributed to the film's unprecedented success and acclaim. \\"E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial\\" is considered a timeless classic that continues to evoke powerful emotions from audiences worldwide, due in large part to Welsh's unforgettable vocal contribution."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I am verifying the answers generated by an automatic system to the following question: what is the biggest virus Suggested answer: Mimivirus is a viral genus containing a single identified species named Acanthamoeba polyphaga mimivirus (APMV), or is a group of phylogenetically related large viruses (designated usually MimiN). Should I validate this answer? The answer is:","output":"To determine if the answer provided is valid, I will follow these steps: 1. Check the accuracy of the information provided in the answer. 2. Compare the size of the Mimivirus to other known large viruses. Step 1: Checking the accuracy of the information provided in the answer. The answer provided states that Mimivirus is a viral genus containing a single identified species named Acanthamoeba polyphaga mimivirus (APMV). Additionally, it mentions that Mimivirus is a group of large viruses, usually designated as MimiN. After researching, I have confirmed that Mimiviruses are giant viruses, and the first-discovered species was indeed the Acanthamoeba polyphaga mimivirus (APMV). Moreover, Mimiviridae is a family of large viruses, and additional members have been identified. Step 2: Compare the size of the Mimivirus to other known large viruses. The Mimivirus has a size of about 500 nanometers in diameter, making it one of the largest known viruses. However, since the time it was discovered, other larger viruses have been found. For instance, Pandoravirus is around 1,000 nanometers in diameter, and Pithovirus is also bigger than Mimivirus. Therefore, based on the current information, the answer should be revised as follows: \\"No, do not validate the answer as provided. While Mimivirus is indeed a large virus, it is not the biggest. Other larger viruses, such as Pandoraviruses and Pithoviruses, have since been discovered. The biggest virus found so far would be a close contest between Pandoravirus and Pithovirus.\\""},{"instruction":"Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Saturday was my husband's birthday, but we spent most of the time in the car. We were driving to Phoenix for the weekend to celebrate his birthday and see the Warriors play the Suns. My husband is a lucky man. Not only has he lived to see another birthday, but he doesn't mind driving 200 miles to see an NBA basketball game. In the car, his cellphone kept ringing with birthday greetings from family and friends. He put them all on the speakerphone so he could drive with both hands and I could listen in even though it wasn't my birthday. Meanwhile, on the CD player, the Reverend AL Green began to singLove and Happiness. A little good music makes a bad road better. Four hours later, we checked into hotel, got dinner and sat out a rooftop feeling glad to be alive. We had a great weekend--we ate too much, slept too little and the Warriors, well, they lost. But still, it was worth the drive. On the way home, I started thinking about birthdays. In our family, we celebrate four in January, four in February, and all the others throughout the year. Mine is next week. I felt lucky, like my husband, I will get cards and calls and maybe a few videos. I don't need presents any more.

Article: Alexander Bonds shot officer Miosotis Familia through an open window in a NYPD vehicle, police said. View Full Caption Department of Corrections and Twitter/NYPD46Pct      FORDHAM — An ex-con fatally shot a 12-year NYPD veteran in an \\"unprovoked attack\\" as she sat in a marked command vehicle in The Bronx Wednesday morning, officials said.      Alexander Bonds, 34, who was twice convicted of robbery and previously railed against law enforcement in a Facebook video, stalked up to the open window of the large NYPD vehicle and fired his silver revolver, hitting Miosotis Familia, 48, in the head before fleeing the scene as her partner radioed for backup near the corner of Morris Avenue and East 183rd Street about 12:30 a.m., officials said.      \\"Based on what we know right now, this was an unprovoked attack against police officers who work to keep this great city safe,\\" NYPD Commissioner James O'Neill said.      Familia, the mother of three, was transported to Saint Barnabas Hospital where she died of her wounds, police said.      Responding officers found Bonds, who was on parole for a robbery in Syracuse from 2005, a block away running on Morris Avenue where they confronted him and he drew a revolver, according to O'Neill. The officers fatally shot him and a silver revolver was recovered at the scene.            Investigators recovered a silver revolver Alexander Bonds used to fatally shoot NYPD officer Miosotis Familia Wednesday morning, officials said. (NYPD)      \\"Cops were running, running, running on every block. I looked down and saw a whole crowd,\\" said Brenda Moorer, 51, who lives near the shooting scene.      Witnesses heard the police salvo and saw responders carrying Bonds away in \\"in a bag,\\" according to Moorer.      \\"I heard about six shots. Somebody yelled, 'Get out! Let's go!'\\" said Indhira Almonte, 24, who lives nearby.      \\"It was scary,\\" Almonte added.      A bystander was also hit in the stomach as police opened fire on the suspect, and was listed in stable condition, a police spokesman said.      Bonds, who the NYPD said lived in Manhattan, has a criminal history stretching back to 2000, when he was arrested for marijuana possession in Queens, officials said.      Then, in May and July 2001, he was arrested for selling drugs at the age of 19, Bronx prosecutors said. He pleaded the May charge down to disorderly conduct, officials said.      He was arrested for an assault in Queens in 2001, but pleaded down to obstruction of governmental administration as a youthful offender, officials said.      The next year he was busted for selling drugs in March and then again in April, this time near a school, Bronx prosecutors said. He was indicted for the April arrest and pleaded guilty, officials said.      Bonds was supposed to complete a drug program, but didn't and was instead sentenced in March 2004 to time behind bars until October of that year, officials said.      Bonds was cuffed in 2005 for fare beating, but pleaded guilty to trespassing, prosecutors said.      He was arrested again in 2005 for robbery in Syracuse, according to police there who said records for that incident are sealed. He was convicted on that robbery in 2006 and was behind bars until May 2013 when he was paroled, records show.      Bonds was still on parole when he gunned down Familia, records show.      In September 2016, Bonds posted a rambling 11-minute Facebook Live video on his page in which he railed against prison guards' treatment of inmates and seemed to warn police against interacting with him.      \\"I’m not playing, Mr. Officer. I don’t care about 100 police watching this s--t. You see this face? You see this face with anything? Leave it alone. Trust and believe. I got broken ribs for a reason, son. We’re gonna scrape We gotta do something. We can’t be dying for free. We can’t be getting raped for free,\\" Bonds said.      Neighbors at his Longwood home were generally wary of him.      \\"I'd seen him a couple times before. I fear God. I don't fear no man, but he looked suspicious,\\" said Alvaro Kidd, 33, who lives a few doors down.      Kidd saw Bonds the night of the shooting about 7:30 p.m., he said.      \\"He was on the corner with some other people, like seven or eight of them. I don't know if they were drinking or what, but they didn't look like they were up to any good,\\" Kidd added.      Family couldn't say what spurred Bonds to assassinate Familia.      \\"What triggered him and what startled him and created this whole situation, I'm not aware of that,\\" said Bonds' uncle, Jamel Bailey, who visited his home after the shooting.      \\"I'm trying to find out what's going on. It's overwhelming for me right now,\\" Bailey added.      Bonds relatives extended their condolences to Familia's family.      \\"I feel for the family. My heart goes out to the family,\\" Bailey said.      It wasn't immediately clear if Bonds had any previous interactions with Familia, who Fordham residents said was a friendly face in the neighborhood.      \\"She was a very sweet lady. She always greeted us. She was a beautiful police officer. I would've been the last person to say hello to her. I just feel terrible,\\" Moorer said.      Police hovered around her Kingsbridge Heights apartment building where her grieving family gathered.      \\"She was an excellent woman,\\" her brother-in-law Carlos Corporan said. \\"She was an excellent woman. The family is devastated.\\"      \\"[Her] mom is incredibly heartbroken,\\" said family friend Isabel Roman.      Politicians and police leaders visited Saint Barnabas Hospital after Familia's death to express their support for her family and the NYPD.      “[Familia] gave her life protecting a neighborhood that had been plagued by gang gun violence,\\" Patrolmen's Benevolent Association president Pat Lynch said.      \\"Fully knowing the dangers that she faced, she suited up in uniform everyday and stood tall against those who threaten and terrorize the good folks of the Bronx,\\" Lynch added.      Lynch urged a stop to violence against police officers and for those who see threats to members of service to report it to authorities.      \\"As we mourn her death and support her family, friends and colleagues, we ask for your help. Violence against police officer cannot stand. When you see or hear someone making threats against NYC police officers you need to let us know, you need to be our eyes and ears.”      Familia's killing closely resembled the 2014 assassinations of officers Wenjian Liu and Rafael Ramos who were sitting in their police car when Ismaayil Brinsley came up and shot them.      Brinsley then turned the gun on himself and committed suicide after fatally shooting the officers.

Q:Background: Similar to the results of a negatively charged rod, if a positively charged rod is brought near the knob of a neutral electroscope, it will attract some electrons up from the leaves onto the knob. That process causes both of the leaves to be positively charged (excess protons), and the leaves will diverge. If the positively charged rob is actually touched to the knob, the rob will remove some electrons and then when the rob is removed, the electroscope will remain positively charged. This is a permanent positive charge.  Paragraph: Jim's dad is a scientist. While his dad is out working he goes to the lab in the basement and find an electroscope.

Fact: photosynthesis makes food for the plant by converting carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight into carbohydrates Question: Which of the following is never an element used to make carbohydrates for the plant? What's the answer?","output":"The following is never an element used to make carbohydrates for the plant: Nitrogen Carbohydrates are organic molecules primarily composed of carbon (C), hydrogen (H), and oxygen (O) atoms, in a specific ratio. This ratio is typically 1:2:1, meaning for every carbon atom, there are two hydrogen atoms and one oxygen atom (e.g., glucose - C6H12O6). Photosynthesis, the process by which plants produce carbohydrates (food), involves the conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2), water (H2O), and sunlight into carbohydrates and oxygen (O2). Nitrogen (N), on the other hand, is not a component of carbohydrates, and is therefore never an element used to make carbohydrates for the plant. Nitrogen is essential for plant growth as it is a key component of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA), proteins, and chlorophyll - the pigment responsible for capturing sunlight during photosynthesis. However, plants obtain nitrogen through other means, such as by absorbing nitrogen compounds present in the soil.

Instantly the ship explodes and begins to sink. Next morning Hideto Ogato (Akira Takarada) receives a phone call. Being a salvage expert the coast guard wants him to report immediately as a result of the sinking.A situation room is set up to investigate the sinking of the Eiko Maru. Its last position is known but the cause of the sinking is still a mystery, though an explosion is suspected. A rescue vessel \\"Bingo Maru\\" approaches the location of the sinking. Again a flash of light erupts out of the water and the Bingo Maru suffers the same fate as the Eiko Maru.The Coast Guard assures frantic families of the crews of the two ships, that everything is being done including more ships and helicopters committed to the search. Finally there are results as three survivors are found in the water.

In an opening scene before the credits, an assassin, Banat, is seen preparing a gun while a gramophone skips as it plays. The story that follows is the narrative of a letter from Howard Graham, an American armaments engineer, to his wife Stephanie. While journeying to the Soviet port of Batumi to return to the United States to complete his business with the Turkish Navy, Graham and his wife stop in Istanbul and are met by Kopeikin, a Turkish employee of Graham's company, who under the pretense of discussing business, takes Graham to a nightclub to introduce him to dancer Josette Maretl and her partner Gogo. Banat tries unsuccessfully to kill Graham during a magic act, shooting the magician instead. Graham is brought to the headquarters of the Turkish secret police for questioning, where Colonel Haki blames the assassination attempt on German agents seeking to delay the re-arming of Turkish ships. The colonel shows Graham a photograph of Banat, who he says was hired by a Nazi agent named Muller. Haki then orders Graham to travel secretly to Batumi aboard a tramp steamer, while Haki personally oversees the safe overland transit of Stephanie.  Graham's fellow passengers include Josette and Gogo; Kuvetli, an ingratiating Turkish tobacco salesman; Professor Haller, an apolitical German archeologist; and the henpecked Matthews and his French wife. Josette sees that Graham is frightened, and not knowing that he is married, tries to become close to him. At an interim port call, Graham is made aware of the arrival of a new passenger by the annoying clamor of a gramophone, while Haller warns him that Kuvetli is not who he claims to be. At dinner Graham recognizes Banat and tries to persuade the ship's captain and purser to put him ashore, but they believe that he is crazy. Graham turns to Josette for help and she has Gogo engage Banat in a poker game while Graham unsuccessfully searches Banat's cabin for the assassin's gun.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What were the full name of the person who was initially unable to obtain evidence that the geological feature was a crater? ?  The Chicxulub crater (; Mayan: [tʃʼikʃuluɓ]) is an impact crater buried underneath the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico. Its center is located near the town of Chicxulub, after which the crater is named. It was formed by a large asteroid or comet about 11 to 81 kilometres (6.8 to 50.3 miles) in diameter, the Chicxulub impactor, striking the Earth. The date of the impact coincides precisely with the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary (K–Pg boundary), slightly less than 66 million years ago, and a widely accepted theory is that worldwide climate disruption from the event was the cause of the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, a mass extinction in which 75% of plant and animal species on Earth became extinct, including all non-avian dinosaurs. The crater is estimated to be 150 kilometres (93 miles) in diameter and 20 km (12 mi) in depth, well into the continental crust of the region of about 10–30 km (6.2–18.6 mi) depth. It is the second largest confirmed impact structure on Earth and the only one whose peak ring is intact and directly accessible for scientific research.The crater was discovered by Antonio Camargo and Glen Penfield, geophysicists who had been looking for petroleum in the Yucatán during the late 1970s. Penfield was initially unable to obtain evidence that the geological feature was a crater and gave up his search. Later, through contact with Alan Hildebrand in 1990, Penfield obtained samples that suggested it was an impact feature. Evidence for the impact origin of the crater includes shocked quartz, a gravity anomaly, and tektites in surrounding areas. In 2016, a scientific drilling project drilled deep into the peak ring of the impact crater, hundreds of meters below the current sea floor, to obtain rock core samples from the impact itself. The discoveries were widely seen as confirming current theories related to both the crater impact and its effects. A:","output":"The full name of the person who was initially unable to obtain evidence that the geological feature was a crater is Glen Penfield.

The new insight is that the direction of the orbital angular momentum is also quantized. The fact that the orbital angular momentum can have only certain directions is called space quantization. Like many aspects of quantum mechanics, this quantization of direction is totally unexpected. On the macroscopic scale, orbital angular momentum, such as that of the moon around the earth, can have any magnitude and be in any direction. Detailed treatment of space quantization began to explain some complexities of atomic spectra, but certain patterns seemed to be caused by something else. As mentioned, spectral lines are actually closely spaced doublets, a characteristic called fine structure, as shown in Figure 30.53. The doublet changes when a magnetic field is applied, implying that whatever causes the doublet interacts with a magnetic field. In 1925, Sem Goudsmit and George Uhlenbeck, two Dutch physicists, successfully argued that electrons have properties analogous to a macroscopic charge spinning on its axis. Electrons, in fact, have an internal or intrinsic angular momentum called intrinsic spin S . Since electrons are charged, their intrinsic spin creates an intrinsic magnetic field.

In August and September they returned to the US, with a 30-concert tour of 23 cities. Generating intense interest once again, the month-long tour attracted between 10,000 and 20,000 fans to each 30-minute performance in cities from San Francisco to New York.In August, journalist Al Aronowitz arranged for the Beatles to meet Bob Dylan. Visiting the band in their New York hotel suite, Dylan introduced them to cannabis. Gould points out the musical and cultural significance of this meeting, before which the musicians' respective fanbases were \\"perceived as inhabiting two separate subcultural worlds\\": Dylan's audience of \\"college kids with artistic or intellectual leanings, a dawning political and social idealism, and a mildly bohemian style\\" contrasted with their fans, \\"veritable 'teenyboppers' – kids in high school or grade school whose lives were totally wrapped up in the commercialised popular culture of television, radio, pop records, fan magazines, and teen fashion.

As a result, Gould continues, the traditional division between folk and rock enthusiasts \\"nearly evaporated\\", as the Beatles' fans began to mature in their outlook and Dylan's audience embraced the new, youth-driven pop culture.During the 1964 US tour, the group were confronted with the reality of racial segregation in the country at the time, particularly in the South.

Given those answer options, answer the question: When asked to define ourselves we often use broad brushstrokes. Without thinking we consult our internal list of “things that make me, ME” and find ourselves recalling words like “creative, outgoing, photography, guitar” before we’ve even had a chance to fully process the question. But how much does this internal list define us? I believed that my internal list was the best representation of myself until I read a quote by Annie Dillard that states: “How we spend our days, is of course, how we spend our lives”. This quote hit me like a punch in the gut, it’s blatant truth so indisputable; how I spent my days, regardless of what I told myself about myself, was ultimately who I was. Or at the very least would be how I had spent my life. This is why, when completing my self portrait, I decided to focus on the everyday. Within my self portrait I wanted to present the viewer with a familiar yet abstract sense of reality through which we get to see amalgamated glimpses of the everyday acts that define me, rather than a linear narrative or a simple re-telling of ‘a day in the life’. Thus combining to create a picture of: my daily life, through an abstracted version of ‘the everyday’. To create a sense of ‘the day’ or linear progression of time I segmented my video with four still images of the sky in various stages of daylight (morning, midday, afternoon, evening) that match the lighting seen in each concurrent video segment. The everyday acts that define me were presented in a series of short video segments that include scenes of me catching the tram, recording music and riding my bike. To disrupt the sense of linear narrative the visual segments are bluntly edited together, with nothing linking the sequential shots and a quite abrupt ending. I also attempted to create an overall sense of confounded time and space by overlaying audio from certain video segments onto others.

Silver town was sustainable and didn't use any fertilizers or pesticides, while Gold town did.  Which town caused fewer decomposers to use up all the oxygen in the water? A:","output":"A: Silver town caused fewer decomposers to use up all the oxygen in the water. To understand this answer, let's delve into the details of how each town approaches food production and their potential impact on the environment, particularly on water sources. Silver town practices sustainable agriculture, which means they do not use any synthetic fertilizers or pesticides. Sustainable agriculture aims to use natural methods and resources to achieve long-term productivity while minimizing adverse environmental impacts. Examples of sustainable agriculture practices include crop rotation, the use of compost and other organic matter to improve soil fertility, and integrated pest management using beneficial insects and organisms. Since Silver town refrains from using fertilizers and pesticides, there is less risk of these chemicals leaching into the water system, such as streams, rivers, and aquifers. It is essential to consider that synthetic fertilizers can contribute to an excess of nutrients, like nitrogen and phosphorus, in water sources, leading to a phenomena known as eutrophication. Eutrophication occurs when an overload of nutrients fuels the rapid growth of algae and other plants, which subsequently die, fall to the water body bottom, and decompose. The process of decomposition requires oxygen, which means decomposers use up massive amounts of oxygen dissolved in the water during this process. This oxygen depletion can lead to \\"dead zones\\" where fish and other aquatic life are unable to survive due to a lack of oxygen. On the other hand, Gold town uses conventional farming methods that rely on synthetic fertilizers and pesticides to increase crop yields. The excessive use of these chemicals can create environmental concerns as they have the potential to leach into water sources. As previously mentioned, this can lead to eutrophication, oxygen depletion in water bodies, and harm to aquatic ecosystems. Hence, given the differences in agricultural approaches used by Silver town and Gold town, the sustainable agriculture practiced by Silver town is less likely to cause decomposers to use up all the oxygen in the water. This is because the methods used in Silver town minimize the risk of nutrient-rich chemicals entering the water system, reducing the likelihood of eutrophication and subsequent oxygen depletion brought on by decomposers."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

He had hidden a gun under a beach umbrella and also threw grenades, forcing people to run for their lives. Some survivors have been speaking about their ordeal. Full coverage of the Sousse attack Angela Evans and her friend lay face down in the sand playing dead as the gunman passed. \\"We both looked up, stood up, there was this man there in black, several rows of sun loungers away just stood there with his huge gun moving round all the people shooting them, just killing, murdering them. \\"You can't run, you're an open target running, he was shooting anyone on their feet as well as people on sun loungers, he was just killing them. \\"So we both at the same time, [said] play dead, we just fell to the ground, faces in the sand. \\"The shooting continued. He just kept on shooting, it was coming nearer and nearer. Then his feet were at the side of me. \\"You don't move, because you're next. You just pray to God. \\"Then there was this noise, this heavy clicking noise, into the sand fell part of the gun, a magazine... You still have to pretend you're dead. \\"And then click again. He put more bullets in. \\"And then there was a noise. I don't know what noise, just a noise. I could feel him move and the shooting started again.\\" Ms Evans, from King's Lynn in Norfolk, described hearing the gunman leave the beach towards a hotel. When the pair thought it was safe, they ran to another hotel. She said staff there hid her and her friend in an office until it was over. Saera Wilson said her fiance Matthew James, 30, from Trehafod, near Pontypridd, was trying to protect her during the gunfire and used his body as a human shield. Ms Wilson, 26, said Mr James was hit in the shoulder, chest and hip. Speaking from the hospital where Mr James, known as Sas, is being treated, Ms Wilson said: \\"He took a bullet for me. I owe him my life because he threw himself in front of me when the shooting started. \\"He was covered in blood from the shots, but he just told me to run away.\\" Shelley Hay, 25, and Ben Milton, 24, from Cardiff, were on the beach with sunbathers when the attack began. Ms Hay told the BBC: \\"I heard what I thought were fireworks and looked to the left of me and the whole beach was running, it was like a stampede. \\"I have never seen anything like it in my life. There were shots - from what I know now as I could see sand flying in the air - I believe it was bullets hitting the floor and the sand was just hitting back, so we just ran.\\" The couple got engaged hours later. Mr Milton proposed after deciding to \\"not let them stop me.\\" Fourteen-year-old Bronwyn Slater was in the sea with her mum when the gunman began firing. \\"We just heard these sounds like bang, bang, bang bang. We just proper ran to my dad. It were terror and shock and sorrow. Then I had to proper sprint for my life really, to survive,\\" she told the BBC. The three of them ran to a shop where they hid in a cupboard for two-and-a-half hours, listening to gun shots and hand grenades being detonated on either side of them. It must have been frightening, said BBC Today presenter John Humphrys. \\"Frightening? It's unbelievable. It's shocking as well and terrifying really,\\" said Bronwyn. Listen to the full interview on BBC Radio Four's Today programme One survivor has spoken about how he was hidden in a hotel laundry room by hotel staff. John Carter, who was on holiday with his wife Lynn, ran into his hotel's kitchen area after hearing gunfire and was hidden in the laundry room. Mr Carter, from Hull said he lost sight of his wife after stopping briefly to urge an older man to run. \\"Then there were big explosions and then gunshots,\\" he said. \\"You didn't know what was going on, and you just saw some legs under where we were hid and they were shouting at them to get in with us, and then someone fell on top of me and it was my wife.\\" Couple Becky Catterick, 19, and Mark Barlow, 24, from Scunthorpe were protected from the gunman by local shopkeepers. Miss Catterick said: \\"We didn't want to say goodbye, but he just kept getting closer so we just all told each other we loved each other.\\" \\"We thought it was the end,\\" Mr Barlow added. Jac Randell, from Cardiff, was on holiday in the resort of Sousse with his partner Hollie Nicklin when the gunman opened fire on Friday. Mr Randell said they ran from the attacker expecting to get shot in the back. \\"Hotel staff formed a line of protection around the hotel. They were prepared to take the bullets for us. You can't thank them enough,\\" he said. One British tourist in Tunisia, whose name was only given as Danny, took refuge under a table with his wife, hearing ''guns and grenades and explosions'' around them. ''I hid under a table and kissed my wife goodbye, thinking that was going to be the end'' he said. Listen to his story A couple from Manchester told the BBC that the gunman was \\"killed about 400 yards\\" from where they were hiding. Olivia Leathley, who was on holiday in Sousse, said she saw \\"hundreds of people running and screaming from the beach,\\" before she managed to hide with her boyfriend, Mike Jones, in a small security lodge. Melanie Callaway, 45, from Hedge End, Hampshire had just been in the sea with her friend Paula Gill, 48, when the shooting started. \\"It was absolutely manic - people were just screaming 'run for your life', 'get off the beach - just run'. It was like a tsunami film where everyone was just running up the beach towards their hotels. \\"We had a five-minute run up the footpath with no shoes on,\\" said Mrs Callaway. The pair barricaded themselves in their room in the Royal Kenz Hotel for five hours with a mattress pushed up against the door. Debbie Horsfall was on holiday in Tunisia and flew back on Saturday morning. She described to the BBC how her friend noticed the gunman, and raised the alarm by shouting ''run, there's a gun''. Graeme Scott, from Irchester, Northamptonshire, was in the Hotel Imperial Marharba with his parents Jen and Sid and cousin Karl when the Tunisian beach attack happened. \\"We were laying by the pool and suddenly there were gunshots - what I thought were gunshots - but dad turned round and said 'it's fire crackers'. \\"I said 'no dad it's gunshots, we have got to go'. So we all got up... and we just headed towards the foyer of the hotel. \\"We just wanted to get safe somewhere. \\"There was about 20 of us in the cellar room with the door shut just for safety and we had to just keep quiet. \\"We just feared for our lives.\\" Listen to the full interview with BBC Radio Northampton Belfast couple Robert McKenzie and his wife, Wilma, had just come out of the sea when the gunman opened fire. The couple were staying at a hotel about 300 yards from where the shooting happened. Mr McKenzie said \\"pandemonium\\" broke out. \\"Everyone was running. I hadn't heard any gunfire,\\" he said. \\"If they had come to our section of the beach, we'd have been wiped out because we always lay right at the front of the beach... and wouldn't have had a chance, quite honestly. \\"By the grace of God, it didn't happen to us.\\"","output":"A bad man with a big gun and links to a group of very mean people called Islamic State started shooting at people on a beach in a place called Sousse.

He nevertheless won an \\"honorable mention\\" at the First International Chopin Piano Competition in Warsaw in 1927. He attributed the disappointment at the competition to suffering from appendicitis and the jury being all-Polish. He had his appendix removed in April 1927. After the competition Shostakovich met the conductor Bruno Walter, who was so impressed by the composer's First Symphony that he conducted it at its Berlin premiere later that year. Leopold Stokowski was equally impressed and gave the work its U.S. premiere the following year in Philadelphia and also made the work's first recording. Shostakovich concentrated on composition thereafter and soon limited his performances primarily to those of his own works. In 1927 he wrote his Second Symphony (subtitled To October), a patriotic piece with a great pro-Soviet choral finale. Owing to its experimental nature, as with the subsequent Third Symphony, it was not critically acclaimed with the enthusiasm given to the First. 1927 also marked the beginning of Shostakovich's relationship with Ivan Sollertinsky, who remained his closest friend until the latter's death in 1944. Sollertinsky introduced the composer to the music of Mahler, which had a strong influence on his music from the Fourth Symphony onwards. While writing the Second Symphony, Shostakovich also began work on his satirical opera The Nose, based on the story by Nikolai Gogol. In June 1929, against the composer's own wishes, the opera was given a concert performance; it was ferociously attacked by the Russian Association of Proletarian Musicians (RAPM). Its stage premiere on 18 January 1930 opened to generally poor reviews and widespread incomprehension among musicians.In the late 1920s and early 1930s, Shostakovich worked at TRAM, a...  answer the following question:  What is the name of the opera that was described as \\"the result of the general success of Socialist construction, of the correct policy of the Party\\"?

Answer:","output":"Robin's actions of holding the baby in Ash's arms and cooing at it softly can be attributed to a variety of reasons and motivations. By analyzing the situation and examining possible motives, we can better understand why Robin may have chosen this course of action. 1. Display of affection and care: One primary reason Robin held the baby in Ash's arms and cooed at it softly could be that it was a genuine display of affection and care for the baby. As a human being, Robin might have a natural inclination to take care of infants and establish a bond with them. Cooing is also known to be an early form of communication between adults and babies, which can be comforting and help strengthen the connection between them. 2. Helping Ash feel more comfortable: Ash might have felt nervous or unsure about how to interact with the baby, so Robin could have taken this initiative to demonstrate appropriate ways in which one can engage with an infant. By holding the baby in Ash's arms and cooing at the baby, Robin may have wanted to create a comfortable environment, allowing both Ash and the baby to relax and enjoy the interaction. 3. Facilitating familiarity or attachment: It's possible that Robin wanted to aid the development of a bond or attachment between Ash and the baby. By creating a physical connection and nurturing setting, Robin may have intended to facilitate the growth of familiarity and attachment between the two individuals. This is particularly important if Ash is the parent or a close family member of the baby. 4. Encouraging the baby's development: Robin might have been aware of the importance of early social interactions with infants in terms of their cognitive and emotional development. Cooing at the baby is a form of verbal engagement and stimulation, which might help enhance the infant's language skills and social development. By cooing at the baby while holding it in Ash's arms, Robin may have been promoting the baby's development and providing them with essential stimuli. 5. Cultural or family customs: It's also possible that Robin's actions were driven by cultural or family customs. In many cultures and families, holding a baby and cooing at them is seen as a traditional way to show love, care, and support. Robin may have been acting in alignment with these traditions, either consciously or unconsciously. 6. Instinctual behavior: Sometimes, people's actions are driven by instinct rather than by deliberate thought or conscious reasoning. Robin may have instinctively felt the need to hold the baby in Ash's arms and coo at it softly, as part of an innate, nurturing instinct to protect and care for vulnerable beings. In conclusion, there are several potential reasons for Robin holding the baby in Ash's arms and cooing at it softly. It could be an expression of affection and care for the baby, a way to provide comfort and familiarity to both Ash and the baby, or an effort to fulfill cultural or family traditions. Ultimately, the action likely represents a combination of these factors, underpinned by the natural human instinct to nurture and care for infants."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Question: \\"What are the principles of Buddhism?\\"  Context: \\"Therefore, according to Mahayana Buddhism, the arahant has attained only nirvana, thus still being subject to delusion, while the bodhisattva not only achieves nirvana but full liberation from delusion as well.

Summarize this article: Six-year-olds have to read aloud 20 real words and 20 made-up words in the check, testing their ability to sound out words using the phonics system. It is meant to test knowledge of the system's 85 letter combinations, but looks at only two-thirds of them. Pupils also needed vocabulary knowledge to read the test words, the study said. The research, presented at the British Educational Research Association conference by Dr Jonathan Solity and Dr Cat Darnell, is a detailed analysis of the words pupils have been asked to read in the check between 2012 and 2014. The controversial test was introduced in 2012 to ensure all children at the end of Year 1 had what the government believed was sufficient phonics knowledge to develop their reading skills. And so it was designed to check only how well children were deploying their knowledge of the letter combinations or \\"graphemes\\", rather than using their knowledge of vocabulary to read. Hence the inclusion of 20 so-called \\"pseudo words\\". But the researchers said, because of the complexity of the English language, children needed to use vocabulary knowledge to work out how to pronounce 40% of the words in the test. For example, the word \\"brown\\" was included in the 2014 test. But as the \\"ow\\" sound can be pronounced in two different ways - to rhyme with \\"cow\\" or \\"slow\\", the researchers said it was only by knowing the meaning of the word \\"brown\\" that children would be able to pronounce it correctly. They also said children could get high scores in the test even if they were able to read only words made up of simple sounds such as the sound \\"d\\" in \\"dog\\". Ministers strongly advocate the teaching of systematic synthetic phonics in schools. This is where children use only their knowledge of graphemes in order to sound out simple words - before they go on to tackle more irregular words that they simply have to remember how to pronounce. The researchers said schools may be wasting their time teaching more complex graphemes of little use to children in reading. And the children, particularly those who are disadvantaged and from less \\"language rich\\" homes, would benefit more from efforts to build vocabulary. This undue focus on the rarer language sounds could leave pupils struggling to read, the researchers said. Dr Solity, an honorary research fellow at University College London, said: \\"This is not an anti-phonics argument. It is absolutely clear that children need to be taught phonics, and systematic synthetic phonics in particular. \\"What we are questioning is whether it is worth teachers spending a great amount of time making sure pupils learn all 85 , rather than concentrating on the most frequent ones and then building pupils' vocabulary.\\" The government has insisted that its test works well to pick up the children struggling to read using phonics and enables interventions to be put in at an early stage. A Department for Education spokesperson said the research was misleading. \\"We test a wide range of phonics knowledge from a range of content, but it would be impossible to test every aspect that is taught in a single check. \\"Over time, as more tests are carried out, they will cover the full breadth of knowledge required under the curriculum.\\" Summary:","output":"A study presented at the British Educational Research Association conference has questioned the effectiveness of the phonics test for six-year-olds in the UK. The check, introduced in 2012, requires children to read 20 real and 20 made-up words as a means of ascertaining their knowledge of 85 letter combinations. However, researchers argue that the test only covers two-thirds of these combinations and that students must also possess vocabulary knowledge to pass. The research also indicates that children could pass the test by only reading words made up of simple letter sounds. Concentrating on rarer letter combinations could hinder reading ability, whilst boosting vocabulary might be more valuable, particularly for disadvantaged children from “less language rich” homes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Holly devises a plan to invent a secret admirer for her mother, so she'll be happy and not have to relocate anymore. Holly overhears her friend Amy's (Vanessa Lengies) uncle Ben (Chris Noth) ordering flowers for a woman, and decides to use his advice on women (which she acquires by telling him she needs help for a school project on romance). Following Ben's advice, she sends her mother orchids and other gifts and love notes, and is soon communicating with her mother as this fictitious admirer (who Holly names Ben) via the internet. As her mother becomes more interested, Holly has to find a photo of this admirer. She sends one of the real Ben, and then devises a reason why they can't meet in person, claiming he is working in China. While she is developing the online romance between her mother and fake Ben, and preventing her mother and the real Ben from meeting in person, she finds herself drawn to a cute, artistic boy in her class, Adam (Ben Feldman), but is unwilling to get close to anyone due to her history of being uprooted and having to say goodbye so often. As the charade continues, and as Holly spends more time with Ben while picking his brain for romance tips, she slowly begins to see qualities in Ben which make her believe he is her mother's 'perfect man.' Unfortunately there is no way her mother can ever meet the real Ben without Holly's plan being exposed. Holly asks help from Adam to disguise as Ben in the telephone and break up with Jean. But he fails, as he is revealed to be harboring feelings for Holly as well, in effect telling Holly's mother the opposite of what is planned. Next day at school, Adam admits his feelings for Holly by kissing her. That night, Lenny (Mike O'Malley), a man who is infatuated with Jean, proposes to her and she replies with a 'maybe'.

Article: I spent my childhood walking a fine line between being an energetic young boy and avoiding contact sports to protect my eyesight. I had lost the sight in one eye at the age of five, so instead of football, I put my energy into rowing and sailing. By the time I was 22, I was working towards rowing for my country. Then, during a training session, I noticed my vision was unclear in my remaining eye. I had an operation and spent two weeks with bandages over my eyes. Sadly, it didn't work, and the second operation two months later was also a failure. My world came crashing down. I had been flying high---- as well as my shining rowing career, I had been about to take my finals and get a job in the city. Now, as my fellow graduates celebrated their results, I lay in my childhood bedroom, angry. I would wake up in the morning and convince myself I could see a shadow, but I felt bitterly angry when I realized I couldn't. Previously, I had lots of assumptions about blind people, but now I joined their ranks. I had no choice but to change my attitude. I started to realize that my challenge was not about seeing but about creating a new life for myself. The simple pleasure of just sitting in a cafe and watching the world go by or even making eye contact with anyone is no longer possible. I had to rethink how to engage with the world. As much as I disliked the things of blindness---- white sticks, talking computers and guide dogs---- I welcomed these as the tools that would enable me to regain my independence. I moved out of my mum's house and got a job in entertainment. I also started seeking out projects that would help me get out and mix with people. A big part of my identity has always been about the thrill of competing---- success and failure. I am excited when I am giving it my all, so I started to compete again, first in rowing and then in extreme physical challenges such as completing six marathons in seven days in Gobi desert. Filling my life with experiences helped to sweep the blindness to one side. It took me... Question: We can learn from the passage that   _  .

Please answer the following question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.   Which student learned more about mantle convection?  Two friends were in college. Hank studied plate tectonics, while his buddy Alex studied Earth's atmosphere. They were both very fascinated by the subjects.  Hint: The theory of plate tectonics demonstrates that the continents of the Earth are moving across the surface at the rate of a few centimeters per year. This is expected to continue, causing the plates to relocate and collide. Continental drift is facilitated by two factors: the energy generation within the planet and the presence of a hydrosphere. With the loss of either of these, continental drift will come to a halt. The production of heat through radiogenic processes is sufficient to maintain mantle convection and plate subduction for at least the next 1.1 billion years.At present, the continents of North and South America are moving westward from Africa and Europe. Researchers have produced several scenarios about how this will continue in the future. These geodynamic models can be distinguished by the subduction flux, whereby the oceanic crust moves under a continent. In the introversion model, the younger, interior, Atlantic ocean becomes preferentially subducted and the current migration of North and South America is reversed. In the extroversion model, the older, exterior, Pacific ocean remains preferentially subducted and North and South America migrate toward eastern Asia.As the understanding of geodynamics improves, these models will be subject to revision. In 2008, for example, a computer simulation was used to predict that a reorganization of the mantle convection will occur over the next 100 million years, causing a supercontinent composed of Africa, Eurasia, Australia, Antarctica and South America to form around Antarctica.Regardless of the outcome of the continental migration, the continued subduction process causes water to be transported to the mantle. After a billion years from the present, a geophysical model gives an estimate that 27% of the current ocean mass will have been subducted. If this process were to continue unmodified into the future, the subduction and release would reach an equilibrium after 65% of the current ocean mass has been subducted. Answer:","output":"Hank learned more about mantle convection. This is because he studied plate tectonics, which is directly related to mantle convection and the movement of tectonic plates. Alex, on the other hand, studied Earth's atmosphere, which is not as directly related to mantle convection."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Add to that, if somehow they did not like me, after a week I would not have a job! Now, I understand actors and actresses go to auditions and not get paid all the time.

In your case, it seems that you learned about the true nature of the job at different points in time. Here is a detailed analysis of when you discovered the reality of your employment situation: 1. Five minutes into the job: It's possible that indicators of the job not being what you expected began to show shortly after you started working. At this point, you might have noticed discrepancies between what you were told during the hiring process and what you were experiencing in the workplace. For example, the work environment, tasks, or interactions with colleagues might not have been what you were led to believe. 2. Not enough information: In some cases, lack of information during the hiring process can lead to misunderstandings about the nature of the job. If the employer did not provide a clear and comprehensive description of the role, its responsibilities, and conditions, it could have contributed to the confusion you experienced. Moreover, this lack of information is likely to have made it difficult for you to determine whether or not the job met your expectations. 3. One week into the job: Sometimes, it takes a little while to understand the true nature of a job. After working for a week, you would have had more opportunities to observe and engage with the job's responsibilities, requirements, and overall conditions. During this time, you may have become increasingly aware of the discrepancies between what you were promised and what you were experiencing, leading to the realization that the job was not what you expected. 4. Before starting the job: In some cases, individuals might discover that a job is not what they thought even before they start working. This could occur through conversations with other employees, online reviews, or further research into the company. At this point, it might have become apparent that the employer had misrepresented the role or had not provided sufficient information about it, causing you to question your decision to accept the job. To avoid the challenges you faced with this particular job, it is essential to seek accurate and detailed information about prospective roles, communicate openly with potential employers, and consider your own expectations. By doing so, you can increase the likelihood of finding a job that aligns with your values, goals, and interests, leading to a more fulfilling and positive employment experience."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Multi-choice problem: does word \\"take\\" have the same meaning in the following two sentences? Do you take sugar in your coffee? A reading was taken of the earth's tremors. Choices:  (a). different meanings;  (b). the same meaning;","output":"(a). different meanings The word \\"take\\" in these two sentences has different meanings. Although \\"take\\" might appear to have a similar function within both sentences, the context of each sentence significantly alters the meaning of the word. Let's analyze each instance: 1. In the first sentence, \\"Do you take sugar in your coffee?\\" the word \\"take\\" is used to refer to the preference or habit of using sugar in one's coffee. In this case, \\"take\\" represents the act of adding or having additional ingredients (such as sugar) in the beverage. This meaning of \\"take\\" aligns more closely with the concept of personal consumption or preference. 2. In the second sentence, \\"A reading was taken of the earth's tremors.\\" the word \\"take\\" serves an entirely different purpose. Here, \\"taken\\" is the past participle of \\"take\\" and refers to the action of collecting, gathering, or measuring something, which in this case would be the earth's tremors through a reading. The focus of \\"take\\" in this sentence is on data collection, measurement, or recording, which is quite different from the meaning in the first sentence. In conclusion, the contexts and implied meanings of the word \\"take\\" in these two sentences are distinct from one another.

Movie title: The Fox and the Child Movie plot: A young girl of about 10 years lives in a farm house in the Jura mountains in eastern France. One day in autumn, when she rides her bicycle to school through the forest, she observes a hunting fox. Of course, the fox escapes, but the girl yearns to meet the animal again. She spends most of her free time in the forests trying to find the fox during the following months, but she doesn't meet the fox again until winter comes. During the winter, she follows the fox's tracks far across the fields. Suddenly she compares her hand to the size of the tracks near to those she is following and discovers they are relatively fresh wolf tracks; she is alarmed as a wolf pack begins howling near her. She runs away panicked, falls and hurts her ankle. The ankle heals very slowly, so that she has to stay at home during the winter reading a book about foxes and other animals of the forest. When spring arrives, the girl is looking for fox holes and waits for the fox. The fox has young babies and moves holes because of her observations; therefore the girl decides to observe the fox from a greater distance. She finds the fox again and tries to get the animal accustomed to her. She feeds it with meat. Later she can even touch the fox and is led to the new den. Finally, the fox arrives at her house and she lets it inside, wanting to show it her bedroom. But the fox becomes distressed at not being able to find a way out and escapes by smashing through her brittle plate glass window, causing the glass to shatter. The fox is hurt badly, but survives and the girl learns that she cannot keep wild animals as pets at home as they are unpredictable and may break more things such as fragile glass windows. Years later she tells the whole story to her son, as seen at the end of the film. Some versions (DVD English) leave out this scene and put the gist of its text over the scene before it. The answer is:","output":"When spring arrives, the girl is looking for fox holes and trying to find the fox, specifically, she wants to observe the fox and its young babies from a distance without disturbing it. She is making efforts to get the fox accustomed to her presence by feeding it meat and eventually being able to touch it, but she ultimately learns the lesson that wild animals cannot be kept as pets at home due to their unpredictable nature and potential to cause harm to themselves and their surroundings."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Ida is introduced to the beautiful and strange girl Misty Falls (Erin Brown a.k.a. Misty Mundae), and is drawn to her. A mysterious package arrives for Ida one day, containing a large unidentifiable mantis-like insect. Landlady Lana Beasley is concerned with Ida's âpetsâ and the effect that may be laid upon her ten-year-old granddaughter Betty, who likes to disguise herself as a ladybug. Betty in turn looks up to Ida, much to Beasleyâs dismay, and Ida promises to keep the insects under check. Later that night, she examines the new insect, which she fondly names âMickâ, and informs her friend Max of the creature. Meanwhile, âMickâ escapes from his tank and attacks Beasleyâs pet dog, consuming the animal. The next day, Ida asks Misty out. They go on a date, and Misty asks if they can watch a movie about âTexas Pixiesâ on Ida's DVD player, which Ida accepts. Misty is introduced to Betty and the apartment, though Ida keeps her away from the bedroom where all her insects are hidden. The two get closer until interrupted by Max.

It's not your fault, but computers naturally get slower over time as you install new software or perform your otherwise day-to-day activities. make this lower case. Firstly, let's explore why your computer could be running slow. There are various factors that contribute to this issue, such as insufficient hardware resources, too many startup programs, malware, or lack of maintenance. Now, let's discuss each aspect in detail and suggest a few methods on how you can improve your computer's performance. 1. Insufficient hardware resources: Your computer might not have enough RAM, or the CPU might not be powerful enough to handle the tasks you are performing. To solve this, you can upgrade your RAM and/or the CPU. You should also ensure there's enough free space on your hard drive as a lack of storage can lead to sluggish performance. 2. Too many startup programs: If you have too many programs that start up automatically when your computer boots up, this can significantly slow down its boot time. You can manage these startup programs by using Windows Task Manager (just press Ctrl-Shift-Esc). Once it is open, click on the Startup tab, where you can disable unnecessary programs from starting automatically when your computer starts up. 3. Malware: Malware, adware, or viruses can bog down your computer's performance. To prevent this, be cautious of any suspicious emails or websites, and always have a reliable antivirus software installed. Regularly run scans and update your antivirus software to keep your computer protected. 4. Lack of maintenance: Regular maintenance is important to keep your computer running smoothly. Here are a few tips for maintaining your computer:     a. Remove unused programs: Uninstalling programs that you no longer need can free up valuable disk space and improve system performance.     b. Clean up temporary files: Deleting temporary files from your computer can also free up disk space and improve system speed. You can use Windows' built-in Disk Cleanup tool or a third-party application to remove these files.     c. Defragment your hard drive: Over time, files on your hard drive can become fragmented, making it slower for your computer to access them. Defragmenting your hard drive can help improve its read/write performance. If you have an SSD, don't defrag it, as they do not benefit from this process in the way that traditional hard drives do.     d. Update your software: Keep your operating system, drivers, and software applications up to date to ensure they perform efficiently and securely.     e. Optimize your computer's power settings: Improper power settings can slow down your computer.

And also, they used those stories to teach people to be kind and respectful to everyone, no matter how different they are.  That's what the Museum of Remembrance and Tolerance is all about.

Given the question: Q: Carboxylic acids are weak acids, meaning they are not 100% ionized in what?    Choices:  - air  - ethanol  - liquid  - water  A: The answer is:","output":"Carboxylic acids are weak acids, meaning they are not 100% ionized in water. Carboxylic acids, which have the general formula R-COOH, are organic compounds that contain a carboxyl group (-COOH) attached to an alkyl or aryl group (R). Examples of carboxylic acids include acetic acid (found in vinegar), citric acid (found in citrus fruits), and lactic acid (found in yogurt and sour milk products). In aqueous solutions, carboxylic acids can undergo ionization, or more specifically, partial ionization, which means that only a small percentage of the acid molecules will lose a proton (H+) and become ionized. This is because the carboxyl group is hydrophilic, which means it attracts water, and the R group is hydrophobic, which means it repels water. The hydrophilic nature of the carboxyl group facilitates the ionization process, while the hydrophobic nature of the R group hinders it. The ionization of carboxylic acids in water can be represented by the following equilibrium reaction: R-COOH (aq) + H2O (l) ⇌ R-COO⁻ (aq) + H3O⁺ (aq) In this reaction, the carboxylic acid (R-COOH) donates a proton (H+) to a water molecule (H2O) to form a negatively charged carboxylate ion (R-COO⁻) and a positively charged hydronium ion (H3O⁺). Since the reaction is in equilibrium, only a small percentage of the carboxylic acid molecules will be ionized at any given time, and the majority of the acid will remain in its un-ionized form. This means that the concentration of H3O⁺ ions in the solution will be relatively low, resulting in a correspondingly low acidity or pH value. Weak acids, like carboxylic acids, are more likely to be 100% ionized in more polar solvents. Water is a highly polar solvent, which allows it to strongly interact with the hydrophilic carboxyl group and facilitate ionization. However, because carboxylic acids are only partially ionized in water, they are considered weak acids. Other solvents, like air, ethanol, and various liquids, may produce different ionization behavior depending on their polarity and other properties. For example, carboxylic acids are even weaker acids in a less polar solvent like ethanol."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

It was written and sung by Queen's drummer, Roger Taylor. The song is featured on the band's 1975 album, \\"A Night at the Opera.\\" As one of Queen's lesser-known tracks, \\"I'm in Love with My Car\\" has developed a cult following among fans. The idea for the song reportedly came to Roger Taylor after one of their roadies, Johnathan Harris, had a deep affection for his car. It serves as an ode to car enthusiasts and is often considered an anthem for them. Its lyrics illustrate a person's anthropomorphic attachment to their car and their preference for the automobile over their romantic partner. The song is characterized by its heavy and driving rhythm, which accentuates the theme of automobile obsession. \\"I'm in Love with My Car\\" was released as the B-side to one of Queen's most iconic singles, \\"Bohemian Rhapsody.\\" Due to its placement on the single, the song received some attention and even charted in certain regions. Although it overshadowed by \\"Bohemian Rhapsody,\\" \\"I'm in Love with My Car\\" remains an essential part of Queen's extensive catalog. The song showcases Roger Taylor's powerful and distinctive voice as the lead singer, which varies from the more familiar vocals of Freddie Mercury, the band's primary vocalist. Throughout their career, Queen members often contributed individual songs, with each member taking on lead vocals for their respective compositions. This collaborative approach helped create the diversity of sound and style that is so characteristic of Queen and contributed to their enduring success and legacy."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the last name of the person whose father settled in London with his wife?  Giovanni Battista Barbirolli was born in Southampton Row, Holborn, London, the second child and eldest son of an Italian father and a French mother. He was a British national from birth, and as Southampton Row is within the sound of Bow Bells, Barbirolli always regarded himself as a Cockney. His father, Lorenzo Barbirolli (1864–1929), was a Venetian violinist who had settled in London with his wife, Louise Marie, née Ribeyrol (1870–1962). Lorenzo and his father had played in the orchestra at La Scala, Milan, where they had taken part in the première of Otello in 1887. In London they played in West End theatre orchestras, principally that of the Empire, Leicester Square. The young Barbirolli began to play the violin when he was four, but soon changed to the cello. He later said that this was at the instigation of his grandfather who, exasperated at the child's habit of wandering around while practising the violin, bought him a small cello to stop him from \\"getting in everybody's way\\". His education at St. Clement Danes Grammar School overlapped, from 1910, with a scholarship at Trinity College of Music. As a Trinity student, he made his concert debut in a cello concerto in the Queen's Hall in 1911. The following year he won a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Music, which he attended from 1912 to 1916, studying harmony, counterpoint and theory under Dr. J. B. McEwen and the cello with Herbert Walenn. In 1914 he was joint winner of the academy's Charles Rube Prize for ensemble playing, and in 1916 The Musical Times singled him out as \\"that excellent young 'cello player, Mr Giovanni Barbirolli.\\" The principal of the Academy, Sir Alexander Mackenzie, had forbidden students to play the chamber music of Ravel, which he regarded as \\"a pernicious influence\\". Barbirolli was keenly interested in modern music, and he and three colleagues secretly rehearsed Ravel's String Quartet in the privacy of a men's lavatory in the Academy.From 1916 to 1918 Barbirolli was a freelance cellist in London.

As a comedian who's been to dozens of comedy clubs, I was extremely disappointed with the disorganization of StandUp Live. I live in CenPho. CityScape is something I'd been anticipating and happy to have Downtown. It's about time we get a real comedy club here! I'd rather spend my money locally than drive to Tempe. (I WON tickets to see Chris Titus, but they were 25 each which is more than fair to pay for this kind of talent. Review is based on the rest of the experience.) My email notified me to be at the venue for the show, which was supposed to start at 9:45. We got there at 9:30. And stood in line at will-call for 10 minutes. (She asked for our parking stub to validate. Thanks!) There was a big group in front of us, a few behind us and ONE girl working the ticket booth. One. On a Friday night. For Chris Titus. Fail #1. As we walked upstairs, there were people lined up, waiting to get in. They gave out a buzzer to let you know when it was your turn to be seated. What??? Why not seat people as they showed up? Don't you want people to start ordering drinks & food BEFORE a show starts? I've gone to clubs early to have a bite to eat and get settled before the show starts. Besides, like comics like to say \\"The more you drink, the funnier I am.\\"  Fail #2 So, we wait. We were told to go into the lobby, with our buzzer, to wait to be seated. Servers were lined up to take each party to their tables. That's the only nice touch of the evening, but even they were backed-up. (It was nice, though, to be out of the monsoon heat!) My buzzer started to blink, so I went to the podium to let the girl working there know. I was informed that it also had to vibrate to get seated. WHY DID IT START BLINKING, THEN??? Fail #3 So, we waiting another half hour. By then, it was after 10:30. The show was supposed to start at 9:45. (So I was told) I am ok waiting a little while. It was the second show of the night, tables have to be cleaned, etc. But it was now almost an hour past the time I was told it would  start. Fail #4 Two people in my party went into the bar next door to get drinks, which didn't count towards the 2-drink minimum. Wait, what? Patrons are spending money within the same company, yet those drinks don't count? Fail #5 Finally, we were seated. Our server happened to be a fellow comedian, and he did a great job. He was the only saving grace of the evening (besides the entertainment itself.) Chris Titus wore a wireless mic, which is great for his act, but the volume? Fail #6  I wish I had checked our tab (and other reviews before going) at the end of the night. Based on the other reviews, we may have been charged the gratuity, but we still left a tip. Prices were CRAZY and NOT on the menu. My friend's martini was 11. And it was TINY. She never would have ordered it if she had known how much it was. I got a non-alcoholic pina colada, which was 6. That's a fair price, but still not on the menu. Fail #7 Our server let us know when last call was & we got our bill in a timely manner. We all paid cash (which, based on other reviews, I am thankful for!) and got our change promptly. The show finally ended just before 12:30. Again, Titus was awesome and did a 90-minute set.

They sent the tape to the Finsbury Park Astoria, where the Beatles were set to play another show. Decades later, a local historian bought the tape at a flea market (or, as the Brits call it, a \\"car boot sale\\"), the BBC reports.

Turkey's lawmakers voted Thursday to authorize military force against the Islamic State terror group in Syria and Iraq, opening the door to cooperation with a U.S.-led coalition going after ISIS as its fighters laid siege to towns just south of the Turkish border. The Turkish Parliament voted 298-98 to not only to let the country's military leave its borders to go after ISIS and other terror groups, but also allow foreign troops to launch operations from Turkey. The authorization takes effect Saturday. It is a big shift for Turkey, a NATO member, which until now offered only tacit support to a U.S.-led coalition of about 40 nations going after ISIS in Iraq and Syria in various capacities. Many have taken to social media to ask why there has been seemingly little attention by the United States and its coalition partners paid to helping the Kurdish fighters in","output":"Kobani, a strategic border town in Syria that has been under siege by ISIS for nearly a month. The fierce battle has seen thousands of Kurdish civilians flee into Turkey for safety, exacerbating an already severe refugee crisis in the region. The Turkish government's decision to authorize military force and allow foreign troops to use its soil for launching operations is expected to significantly bolster the international coalition's efforts against ISIS in the region. This development is particularly crucial, given that Turkey shares a lengthy border with both Syria and Iraq, countries where ISIS has established de facto control over large territories. Now, with Turkey's full commitment to the fight against ISIS, the United States and its coalition partners are likely to turn their attention to assisting Kurdish fighters in Kobani and other embattled areas. The Kurdish forces have been one of the most effective groups combating ISIS on the ground, as they have successfully defended their territories in both Iraq and Syria. Their assistance, along with the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), has proven to be an essential element in combating the terrorist group. As the Turkish military begins to plan and coordinate its operations against ISIS, it's likely that its first priority will be to secure the safety of the Turkish border and prevent the further expansion of ISIS forces from Syria into Turkish territory. This will likely involve close cooperation with Kurdish forces operating in the area. In response to the question of why there has been apparently little assistance provided to Kurdish fighters in Northern Syria, some speculate that Western powers, including the United States, have been reluctant to directly support Kurdish forces due to domestic political considerations in Turkey and ongoing concerns about the aspirations of Kurdish nationalist movements in the region. Turkey, which has a substantial Kurdish minority, has long been wary of any move that could potentially empower Kurdish separatists and further complicate relations in the region. However, now that Turkey has officially joined the fight against ISIS, it is likely that the United States and its allies will step up efforts to provide greater support to Kurdish forces. This may come in the form of increased air support, intelligence sharing, and potentially the delivery of much-needed weapons and ammunition to the Kurdish fighters on the ground. In conclusion, the most logical completion of the news story is that the authorization of military force by Turkey's lawmakers will lead to a more concerted effort by the international coalition to support Kurdish fighters in their struggle against ISIS. With Turkey's participation, the United States and its partners will be better positioned to more effectively target ISIS in both Iraq and Syria, protect vulnerable populations, and ultimately degrade and defeat the terrorist group. Furthermore, the international community must continue to address the ongoing humanitarian crisis, offering assistance to the thousands of refugees fleeing violence and devastation in the region."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Box Office: Angelina Jolie's 'Maleficent' Scores Magnificent 170M Weekend, 'X-Men' Crosses 500M Angelina Jolie’s returned to the silver screen after a near-four year absence and hit the ground running. Walt Disney’s Maleficent, a darker re-imagining of the Sleeping Beauty story with the emphasis on its conflicted villain, debuted over the weekend with a terrific 69.4 million frame, including 6.7m in IMAX alone. That sum included 4.2m in Thursday showings. This is a bit below the 79m debut weekend for Sam Raimi’s Oz: The Great and Powerful. It’s obviously smaller than the 116m weekend debut for Tim Burton’s Alice In Wonderland back in March 2010, which was a record for a non-sequel at the time, but absolutely no one was expecting similar numbers for the Jolie vehicle. In terms of weekend multipliers, it scored a 24.2m opening day, which means the Jolie vehicle had a 2.89x, almost identical to the Mia Wasikowska/Johnny Depp fantasy over its Fri-Sun debut. This is easily Angelina Jolie’s biggest opening weekend ever, ahead of the respective 50 million debuts for Mr. and Mrs. Smith and Wanted and another example of why movie stars still matter. This is as perfect a “star+concept” package as you could imagine, with cinema’s most larger-than-life female movie star playing one of Disney’s most iconic villains. Angelina Jolie in The Tourist only gets you an 18m weekend. Maleficent starring pretty much any one else gets you 50m at best. But putting Jolie in the role gets this you this terrific debut. The 180m fairy tale revamp has also earned 100.6m overseas, including 2.3m in IMAX alone, since opening on Wednesday in 35 territories including Russia, Germany, Australia, the U.K., Korea and Brazil. That gives the film a 170m global debut. How high it flies is a question of how well it plays with the kids. The film is less violent and scary that the trailers might make you believe, but it’s a far grimmer and darker picture than the marketing indicates. I’m perhaps a little “biased” as my daughter didn’t like the film after months of looking forward to it, but I can’t presume that my kid speaks for everyone else. Let’s presume that the film’s tone and somewhat scotch tape-like construction doesn’t really affect word of mouth either way. For the record, Snow White and the Huntsman had a 2.76x weekend-to-domestic final multiplier (155/55m), Alice in Wonderland had a 2.87x multiplier (334m/116m), while Oz: The Great and Powerful had a 2.96x (235m/79m). So going off those relative comparisons, Maleficent is looking at a domestic total of between 193m and 207m. I’m inclined to presume it will act closer to Snow White and the Huntsman considering the similar release date and darker content, but I also imagine that if it gets anywhere near 200 million domestic that it will be dragged over the finish line one way or another, arguably joining the other so close-yet so far blockbusters (Amazing Spider-Man 2, Godzilla, X-Men: Days of Future Past). Nonetheless, the debut shows the sheer power of the Walt Disney brand, as well as the value of old-school star power. And yes, because this can’t be said enough, it indeed matters when an explicitly female-centric picture opens on the same relative scale as conventional male-centric blockbusters. The film played 60% female, 51% over-25, and 35% 3D. The other major opener was frankly a disappointment. Seth MacFarlane’s A Million Ways to Die in the West debuted with 16.7 million over its debut weekend. I honestly thought a few months ago that this star-studded (Charlize Theron, Liam Neeson, Amanda Seyfried, Giovanni Ribisi, Sarah Silverman, Neil Patrick Harris) would be a solid moneymaker for Universal (a division of Comcast Corporation). It won’t lose money, since it only cost 40m, but it won’t be a massive win either. Now absolutely no one in their right mind was expecting an opening on par with Ted (54m) or Neighbors (49m), but this is just ever-so-slightly underwhelming considering the combined drawing power of its cast. The film played 55% male and 72% over-25. The picture also earned 10.3 million in 21 overseas markets. While I don’t think the film quite works, it’s important that MacFarlane be praised rather than condemned for stepping outside of his safe zone, especially as the concessions to his stereotypical fan base (the vulgar potty humor) is a big part of why the film doesn’t work. Once again, I would argue this proves the value of movie stars, as a big part of Ted‘s success was Mark Wahlberg’s drawing power, along with obviously the more easily marketable concept two years ago. “A man’s childhood teddy bear came alive and now lives with him and spouts vulgarities” is an easier sell than “a western comedy.” Charlize Theron is an added value element while Liam Neeson is gold as an action lead, but really no one else in the cast can be considered box office. MacFarlane is a draw, but casting a live-action movie star would have helped the film, both artistically and commercially. Westerns aren’t traditionally big box office and western comedies are all-too-rare. Offhand, the last successful live-action western comedy that comes to mind is the Mel Gibson/Jodie Foster vehicle Maverick from literally twenty years ago (you might count Shanghai Noon in 2000 and Shanghai Knights in 2003, but that terrific Jackie Chan/Owen Wilson series is as much about action as comedy). So it’s disappointing, but not that shocking, that this one didn’t break out. Still, once again, Universal (which distributed the Media Rights Capital, Fuzzy Door Productions, and Bluegrass Films-produced picture) isn’t risking too much because there isn’t much money on the line. MacFarlane has Ted 2 on tap for next summer, which is arguably a surefire hit. I wish it were a better movie, but I think its worthwhile that MacFarlane has started using his capital for more personal choices like this and Fox’s successful Cosmos revamp. In holdover news, X-Men: Days of Future Past earned 32.5 million on its second weekend, down 64% from last weekend’s 90m Fri-Sun debut. That’s right in line with the franchise overall, compared to the 66% Friday-to-Friday drop for X-Men: The Last Stand (102m/35m), 69% drop X-Men Origins: Wolverine (85m/26m), the 68% drop for The Wolverine (53m/21m), the 65% drop for X-Men (54m/23m), the 64% drop for X-Men: First Class (55m/24m), and the 60% drop for X2 (85m/40m). The 20th Century Fox franchise installment now has 162m domestic. The seventh X-Men film is currently running around 8% behind X-Men: The Last Stand, which means if said pattern continues it will end up at 218 million. It will be the second-biggest in the series but pretty much in the middle when adjusted for inflation and the 3D bump. The bad news is that this X-Men installment is just as front-loaded as the other installments in America. The good news is that with an estimated global cume of 500m worldwide as of today, its somewhat disappointing domestic numbers may be almost irrelevant. The film has already surpassed the worldwide totals of X-Men (296m), X-Men: First Class (353m) and X-Men Origins: Wolverine (373m), X2: X-Men United (407m), The Wolverine (412m), and X-Men: The Last Stand (459m) not far behind. This one cost Fox (a division of 21st Century Fox, Inc.) quite a bit of money, well over 20o million and with the hopes of putting the X-Men series on the same level as the Marvel Studios films. In terms of worldwide totals (and money is money no matter where it comes from), it would seem that they have succeeded. I will officially stop being picky about the film’s domestic number for at least the next week or so. Also not exactly holding all that well is Godzilla, which earned 12.25 million on its third weekend, a drop of 60% from last weekend. Warner Bros.’ 165m monster mash has earned 174m domestic. This one will get to 200m domestic but not too much more than that. Gareth Edwards’s franchise revival has earned 374m worldwide, so it will surely end up at least breaking even before its post-theatrical life. The good news is that the film doesn’t open in China and Japan until the middle of next month, so this picture’s worldwide box office story isn’t closed to being written yet. The question is that if the film ends up basically peaking on opening weekend, to what extent should we give credit to director Gareth Edwards (who got a Star Wars spin-off gig off of the film’s debut) as opposed to Warner Bros. marketing? That’s for another day… Blended dropped an okay 41% from last Friday, as the Adam Sandler/Drew Barrymore romantic comedy earned just 8.4 million last night for a 29.6m cume. This Warner Bros. (a division of Time Warner, Inc.) release only cost 45m to produce, but it may not even make that much in the states. Now Adam Sandler movies often take hard second weekend drops before leveling off for the next month as the “consensus choice”, but when you started with just 14.2m for the opening weekend, that’s little consolation. In better comedy news, Neighbors earned another 7.7m over its fourth weekend, giving the Seth Rogen/Rose Byrne/Zac Efron comedy a robust 128.6m domestic cume. The 18m comedy crossed 200m worldwide this weekend and has now earned 207m globally. Million Dollar Arm officially passed its 25m budget in America and now sits with 28m, while The Other Woman should crossed 80m domestic. The Amazing Spider-Man 2 earned another 3.775m over its sixth weekend(-52%) for a 192.73m domestic cume. The film also crossed 690m worldwide this weekend, which means it should cross 700m within the next week or two. Of note, the sequel has now earned 497m overseas, surpassing the 495m foreign total of The Amazing Spider-Man. It’s also the top-grossing film of 2014 in terms of overseas receipts. Heaven is For Real earned another 775k for the weekend (-62%) and brought its cume up to 87.98m while Mom’s Night Out earned 300k (-61%) and has now grossed 9.6m. Jon Favreau’s Chef is now playing on 674 screens and earned 2m (-11%) for a 7m cume. It’s not terrible, but it’s also about half what a film like this could have managed on opening weekend with a conventional wide release less than a decade ago. That’s it for this weekend. Join us next time for when Warner Bros. debuts the terrific Tom Cruise/Emily Blunt sci-fi actioner Edge of Tomorrow (I don’t know that one’s overseas debut numbers yet, save that it did 1.6m on 79 IMAX screens) while 20th Century Fox drops the much-buzzed about (seeing it tomorrow) Shaleine Woodley cancer-stricken romantic drama The Fault in Our Stars.

Article: The sounds you make while chewing have a significant effect on the amount of food you eat, a new study has found. The results suggest that people are likely to consume less if they can hear themselves eating. Researchers at Brigham Young University and Colorado State University have found that your TV, radio, and computer are making you fat. Not by bombarding  you with food ads (though they totally are) but by blocking the sounds of your chewing. In a recent study, they found that the noise your food makes while you're eating can have a significant effect on how much food you eat. \\"Sound is typically labeled as the forgotten food sense,\\" adds Ryan Elder, assistant professor of marketing at BYU's Marriott School of Management. \\"But if people are more focused on the sound the food makes, it could reduce consumption.\\" \\"For the most part, consumers and researchers have overlooked food sound as an important sensory cue  in the eating experience.\\" said study coauthor Gina Mohr, an assistant professor of marketing at CSU. The team carried out three separate experiments to quantify the effects of \\"food sound salience\\" on quantity of food consumed during a meal. In one experiment, participants were given snacks to eat while they wore headphones playing either loud or quiet noises.

Researchers emphasize the importance of mindfulness, not just in taste and appearance, but also in the auditory experience of eating, to help manage food intake."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In the National Basketball Association, zone defenses were prohibited until the 2001--2002 season, and most teams do not use them as a primary defensive strategy. The NBA has a defensive three-second violation rule, which makes it more difficult for teams to play zone, since such defenses usually position a player in the middle of the key to stop penetration. The Dallas Mavericks under coach Rick Carlisle are an example of an NBA team that have regularly used zone defenses. Multi-choice problem: Is it true that can u play zone defense in the nba?

What most naturally follows? How to venetian plaster  Choose a plaster.  Venetian plaster comes in two varieties: synthetic and lime-based. Which one you use will depend on your budget and level of expertise.","output":"After choosing a plaster, the next step most naturally is to prepare the surface for applying the Venetian plaster. To do this, you should: 1. Clean the surface: Make sure the wall you are working on is clean and free of dirt, dust, and loose paint. You can use a cloth or sponge to wipe it down. 2. Repair any cracks or holes: If there are any cracks or holes, you need to fill them with a suitable filler. Once the filler is dry, sand the surface to make it smooth and even. 3. Apply a primer: It's important to apply a primer on the surface before applying the Venetian plaster. This will help the plaster adhere better and give a more durable finish. Let the primer dry according to the manufacturer's instructions. After these steps, you will be ready to apply the Venetian plaster using a trowel or spatula.

There he became Director of the Office of Naval Intelligence and a Vice Admiral. In 1966 he was appointed as Deputy Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), then shortly thereafter as Deputy Director of the CIA, where he served from 1966 to 1969. Sentence: Rufus Lackland Taylor died under the age of 80","output":"After reading the text provided, we can determine that the sentence is true. Rufus Lackland Taylor was born on January 6, 1910, and passed away on September 14, 1978. To verify this statement, let's calculate his age at the time of his death. First, consider the years: 1978 - 1910 = 68 years. Next, take into account the months: September (the month of Taylor's death) - January (the month of Taylor's birth) = 8 months. Finally, consider the days: 14th (the day of Taylor's death) - 6th (the day of Taylor's birth) = 8 days. Taking all this information together, Rufus Lackland Taylor passed away at 68 years, 8 months, and 8 days old. Since his age was 68, this is indeed less than 80 years old.

Article: There are many colours in nature. But do you know that a colour has weight? I think you'll say \\"no\\". But I am afraid you are wrong. If you don't believe, you may do a small experiment . First, put two objects with the same weight into two boxes. Then cover the boxes. Wrap  one box with a red piece of paper, the other with a white piece of paper. Now hold the boxes with your hand one by one. It is certain that you will think the red one is a little heavier. Why does it happen? A scientist found that different colours have different weight in a man's mind. So he did many tests and at last he got the result. That is to say, every colour has its own weight in our mind. The heaviest colour is red, then blue, green, orange, yellow and white. The scientists told us that colours also have smell. Can you smell the colour? Of course not. Then why did the scientists say so? That is because every colour represents a kind of light wave ------ a certain wavelength . It reaches our brain  through organs  According to this discovery, scientists say that people accept the colour they like, and _ the colour they hate. So your body and mind will be healthy by using the colours you like. Or you'll be nervous or even get ill. If you stay in a room with red windows, wallpapers and furniture  for two hours, you'll feel you have been there for four hours. But if the room is blue, you'll feel you have been there for only one hour. Another example, if a person walks out of a red room and into a blue room, his temperature will fall. That means our body temperature will change when we see different colours. Question: What will happen when you get into a cool coloured room from a warm coloured room?

Question: Organic food, once considered something that only health fanatics desired, is now a regular feature at most supermarkets. And that has created a bit of a dilemma. On the one hand, you have a conventionally grown apple. On the other, you have one that's organic. Both apples are firm, shiny and red. Both provide vitamins and fiber, and both are free of fat, sodium and cholesterol. Conventionally grown food generally costs less, but is organic food a better choice? The advantages claimed for such foods over conventionally grown and sold food products are now being debated on a large scale. Supporters of organic foods -- a term whose meaning varies greatly --are frequently telling the world that such products are safer and more nutritious than others. The growing interest of consumers in the safety and nutritional quality of daily foods is a welcome development. However, much of this interest has been aroused by sweeping claims that the conventional food supply is unsafe or inadequate in meeting nutritional needs. Almost daily, the public is surrounded by claims for \\"no-aging\\" diets, new vitamins and other wonder foods. There are numerous unsubstantiated  reports that natural vitamins are superior to man-made ones, that fertilized eggs are nutritionally superior to unfertilized eggs, that untreated grains are better than those treated with insect spray and the like. Although most of these claims are not supported by scientific evidence, large amounts of written material about the benefits of organic foods makes it difficult for people to separate fact from fiction. As a result, claims that eating a diet consisting of organically grown foods prevents or cures disease or provides other benefits to health have become widely advertised and form the basis for people's opinion. One thing that most organically grown food products seem to have in common is that they cost more than conventionally grown foods. But in many cases consumers are misled if they believe organic foods can maintain health and provide better... What is the author's attitude towards the claims of organic foods? A) Doubtful.

Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: Whose decision to leave causes Alise to be left in the care of Queen Uberta, Lord Rodgers and animal friends? from the following article ?  Inhabited on a mysterious island are strange creatures called Boggs who love meat. Unbeknownst to them, it is also inhabited by a shipwrecked boy. He scavenges for some food by distracting the Boggs with animal noises. Far away from the island, Odette and Derek are on their way to help the people by building a bridge leaving Alise in the care of Queen Uberta, Lord Rodgers, and their animals friends: Speed, Jean-Bob, Puffin and the Scullions. Queen Uberta begins to prepare Alise to learn how to be and act like a princess. But Alise doesn't want to be a princess in this way but to be a modern princess. Lord Rogers says that Alise needs adventure but Queen Uberta disagrees. While fighting once again, Alise uses her chance to swim in the lake with her friends but she was quickly sent back to the palace to learn to be proper. Queen Uberta is very strict with Alise, trying to teach her everything, but instead she falls asleep and sent to bed. That same night, Lord Rogers, Jean-Bob, and Speed sneak Alise out of her room to go on an adventure. The next morning, before Queen Uberta enters Alise's room with yoga lessons, she notices that Alise has gone with Lord Rogers. Queen Uberta chases after the group all the way to the port but they escape on a ship. Queen Uberta is furious but nervous about Alise so she sent Puffin and the Scullions after them. On the ship, Alise changes into a pirate costume, making Lord Rogers realize that Uberta was right; he turned Alise into a pirate just when Alise wanted to have fun.

Veolia Transport says the closures at Penclawdd near Swansea and Treforest followed a business review. But it said other companies will be taking over their routes from June. Passengers' group Bus Users UK Cymru said it was disappointed and the focus was on whether councils could re-tender the services. The French-owned firm's chief executive John O'Brien said in March the firm was looking at \\"restructuring\\" in Wales. \\"Following the recent business review we confirm that our Penclawdd depot on the Gower and our Treforest depot outside Cardiff will both be closing over the next few weeks,\\" a statement on Friday read. \\"The schools and local bus services provided from these sites are being taken over by other bus companies.\\" It said many staff would transfer to the new operators and it was in discussions with workers and the Unite union. \\"Our other operating sites at Newport, Abercrave in the Swansea Valley and Crossgates in Powys are unaffected and operations from these sites are continuing as normal,\\" said the statement. Veolia have not confirmed how many services it is withdrawing, but reports suggest the figure stands at 78. Rhondda Cynon Taf is understood to be worst affected by the closures as Veolia provides 28 services in the borough. Services that are partially or wholly subsidised by RCT council will stop at the end of June with commercially-run services stopping on 14 June. \\"Discussions with other commercial operators in the county borough continue with existing providers assessing the need to extend existing routes or introduce new ones,\\" said a council spokesman. \\"A tender process has also begun to secure replacement operators for the services that are wholly or partly subsidised by the Council and were previously operated by Veolia.\\" Cynon Valley AM Christine Chapman added: \\"We need to ensure the stability and certainty of services.\\" Veolia, which employs 450 people in Wales, will also withdraw from routes in Cardiff, Swansea, Bridgend, Vale of Glamorgan, and Merthyr Tydfil. All councils have already made moves to find replacements. Veolia became one of the main operators in Wales in 2006 when it bought Shamrock Travel which saw it take over operating centres in Abercynon, Swansea, Barry and Newport along with 229 vehicles. The firm had previously bought south Wales-based firms Bebb Travel and Pullman Coaches. Many of its services were contracts for local authorities who are having to re-tender their contracts. In November 2010, Veolia was fined £32,900 and banned from starting any new routes for three months, as punishment for poor bus punctuality in the Cardiff area.

Paragraph: (CNN) -- Beyond skateboards, Silicon Valley and hippies, California has a trendsetting streak of a different kind. The state has been first to pass major public health initiatives that have spread throughout the country. California was first to require smog checks for clean air, pass anti-tobacco initiatives and bike helmets laws. While these laws were met with skepticism and ridicule, they've often become standard practice in other states. The Golden State was first to ban smoking in workplaces, bars and restaurants in 1998. Now similar rules exist throughout the country. Some advocates tout the state as a forward-thinking vanguard in which its health and safety laws are routinely emulated by other states. \\"There have been progressive legislations in tobacco, environment and obesity prevention,\\" said Mark Horton, a lecturer at the University of California Berkeley School of Public Health. \\"In some respect, the rest of the country looks to California as a laboratory for moving forward with those various types of initiatives.\\" But some critics liken the Golden State to a nanny state. California has 151,002 health and safety laws. \\"It never ends,\\" said Laer Pearce, who works in public affairs in Orange County. \\"Every year, several hundred bills come through and dozens of them tell us how to live our lives.\\" Starting in January, 760 new California laws went into effect -- for example, the importing of shark fins is prohibited, student athletes are required to have medical clearance after suffering a head injury, teens are banned from using tanning booths and the sale of caffeinated beer is forbidden. There's a perception that California has \\"more folks who are health-oriented and more health-minded,\\" said Horton, former director of the California Department of Public Health. It's not just workout fanatics hanging out at Muscle Beach, Sierra Club members hiking mountains or the uber-health-conscious touting organic foods. Californians in general tend to have healthier habits, ranking 10th for physical activity, fourth for healthy blood pressure and fifth for a diet high in fruits and vegetables compared with other states, according to America's Health Rankings.

Elmer Kenneth Strong (April 21, 1906 - October 5, 1979) was an American football halfback and fullback who also played minor league baseball. Considered one of the greatest all-around players in the early decades of the game, he was inducted into the College Football Hall of Fame in 1957 and the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1967 and was named to the NFL 1930s All-Decade Team. A native of West Haven, Connecticut, Strong played college baseball and football for the NYU Violets. In football, he led the country in scoring with 162 points in 1928, gained over 3,000 yards from scrimmage, and was a consensus first-team selection on the 1928 College Football All-America Team. Unable to reach terms with the New York Giants, Strong signed instead with the Staten Island Stapletons. He played for the Stapletons for four years from 1929 to 1932. While statistics are not available for the 1929 NFL season, Strong was regarded as one of the best backs in the NFL. He started all 10 games at halfback for the 1929 Stapletons. In his first NFL game, he threw a long forward pass to set up the Stapleton's first touchdown and scored all of the team's 12 points on two short touchdown runs. He also had a 70-yard run in a scoreless tie with the Orange Tornadoes on November 3, 1929. Two days later, Strong had a 50-yard touchdown run against the Providence Steam Roller. At the end of the 1929 season, Strong was selected by Collyer's Eye and the Green Bay Press-Gazette as a second-team All-Pro.  In 1930, Strong appeared in all 12 games for the Stapletons and scored 53 points on two rushing touchdowns, five receiving touchdowns, one field goal, and eight extra points. His point total ranked third in the NFL in 1930, trailing only Jack McBride (56 points) and Verne Lewellen (54 points). On September 28, 1930, he caught two touchdown passes, threw a 40-yard pass that set up a third touchdown, and kicked three extra points in a 21-0 victory over the Frankford Yellow Jackets. In December 1930, he led the Stapletons to a 16-7 victory over the New York Giants for the pro football championship of New York City; Strong accounted for all 16 Stapleton points, running 98 yards for a touchdown, passing for a second touchdown, and kicking a field goal and an extra point. He was selected as a first-team player on the 1930 All-Pro Team by Collyer's Eye and the Green Bay Press-Gazette.  In 1931, Strong appeared in all 11 games for the Stapletons and scored 53 points on six rushing touchdowns, one punt return for a touchdown, two field goals, and five extra points. His 53 points ranked fourth in the NFL, trailing only Johnny Blood (84 points), Ernie Nevers (66 points), and Dutch Clark (60 points). On November 22, 1931, Strong scored all 16 points in a 16-7 victory over Cleveland; he had two rushing touchdowns, including a 50-yard run and kicked a field goal and an extra point. At the end of the 1931 season, Strong was selected as an All-Pro for the second year in a row, receiving first-team honors from the United Press (UP) and Collyer's Eye.  Strong's output dropped off in 1932 as he moved to the fullback position. He appeared in 11 games and ranked sixth in the NFL with 375 rushing yards, but scored only 15 points on two touchdowns and three extra points. At the end of the 1932 season, the Stapletons team folded.

Q:What are the names of the two archipelagos of India?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  India's coastline measures 7,517 kilometres (4,700 mi) in length; of this distance, 5,423 kilometres (3,400 mi) belong to peninsular India and 2,094 kilometres (1,300 mi) to the Andaman, Nicobar, and Lakshadweep island chains. According to the Indian naval hydrographic charts, the mainland coastline consists of the following: 43% sandy beaches; 11% rocky shores, including cliffs; and 46% mudflats or marshy shores.Major Himalayan-origin rivers that substantially flow through India include the Ganges and the Brahmaputra, both of which drain into the Bay of Bengal. Important tributaries of the Ganges include the Yamuna and the Kosi; the latter's extremely low gradient often leads to severe floods and course changes. Major peninsular rivers, whose steeper gradients prevent their waters from flooding, include the Godavari, the Mahanadi, the Kaveri, and the Krishna, which also drain into the Bay of Bengal; and the Narmada and the Tapti, which drain into the Arabian Sea. Coastal features include the marshy Rann of Kutch of western India and the alluvial Sundarbans delta of eastern India; the latter is shared with Bangladesh. India has two archipelagos: the Lakshadweep, coral atolls off India's south-western coast; and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, a volcanic chain in the Andaman Sea.The Indian climate is strongly influenced by the Himalayas and the Thar Desert, both of which drive the economically and culturally pivotal summer and winter monsoons. The Himalayas prevent cold Central Asian katabatic winds from blowing in, keeping the bulk of the Indian subcontinent warmer than most locations at similar latitudes. The Thar Desert plays a crucial role in attracting the moisture-laden south-west summer monsoon winds that, between June and October, provide the majority of India's rainfall. Four major climatic groupings predominate in India: tropical wet, tropical dry, subtropical humid, and montane.

If you don't talk much with your parents, they might feel they need to ask you questions to know about your life. It seems to you that your mom is getting into your business, but I think she's just trying to keep a close relationship with you.

Plot title: Hart's War Movie plot: During World War II, U.S. Army intelligence officer First Lieutenant Thomas Hart (Farrell) is captured by German forces. While interrogating Hart, the Germans coerce him to divulge intelligence by taking away his boots, causing his feet to become frostbitten and badly injured, and leaving him, naked, in a very cold cell. He is then transferred by train to Stalag VI-A prisoner of war camp at Hemer, Germany. While en route, a P-51 Mustang attacks (the letters POW were painted on the top of the train, but got covered by thick snow). To save themselves, the POWs leave the train and spell P-O-W with their bodies and prevent further strafing. After arriving at the new POW camp, Lt. Hart is interviewed by the ranking American officer, Colonel William McNamara (Willis). When McNamara asks if he cooperated with the Germans after he was captured, Hart denies it. McNamara knows this to be a lie when Hart says he only endured three days of interrogation. McNamara does not reveal this to Hart, but sends him to bunk in a barracks for enlisted men, rather than allow him to bunk with the other officers. Two black pilots are brought to the camp and assigned to Hart's barracks. They are the only blacks in the camp, and their situation is compounded by their status as officers. Staff Sgt. Vic W. Bedford (Hauser), a racist, is their primary antagonist. One of the pilots, Lt. Lamar Archer, is executed when accused of keeping a weapon that Bedford had planted in his bunk. When Bedford himself subsequently turns up dead, the surviving pilot, Lt. Lincoln A. Scott (Howard) is accused of killing Bedford in retaliation. A law student before the war, Hart is appointed by McNamara to defend the accused pilot at his court-martial, a trial to which the camp commandant, Oberst Werner Visser (IureÅ) agrees. Much later, McNamara reveals to Hart that the \\"defense,\\" like the trial itself, is a sham, an elaborate distraction to hide a planned attack on a nearby ammunition plant (the U.S. Army mistakenly believes it to be a shoe factory) by...

Its location on a coaching route and the opening of a railway station in 1858 were key to its development, and the economic history of Bromley is underpinned by a shift from an agrarian village to commerce and retail. As part of the suburban growth of London in the 20th century, Bromley significantly increased in population and was incorporated as a municipal borough in 1903.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article: In central and northern Italy and in Flanders, the rise of towns that were to a degree self-governing stimulated economic growth and created an environment for new types of trade associations. Commercial cities on the shores of the Baltic entered into agreements known as the Hanseatic League, and the Italian Maritime republics such as Venice, Genoa, and Pisa expanded their trade throughout the Mediterranean.[V] Great trading fairs were established and flourished in northern France during the period, allowing Italian and German merchants to trade with each other as well as local merchants. In the late 13th century new land and sea routes to the Far East were pioneered, famously described in The Travels of Marco Polo written by one of the traders, Marco Polo (d. 1324). Besides new trading opportunities, agricultural and technological improvements enabled an increase in crop yields, which in turn allowed the trade networks to expand. Rising trade brought new methods of dealing with money, and gold coinage was again minted in Europe, first in Italy and later in France and other countries. New forms of commercial contracts emerged, allowing risk to be shared among merchants. Accounting methods improved, partly through the use of double-entry bookkeeping; letters of credit also appeared, allowing easy transmission of money. Question: What accounting method was utilized in this period?","output":"During this period, the accounting method that was used is called double-entry bookkeeping. This method helps keep track of money coming in and going out by recording both sides of each transaction - like money coming in as a \\"credit\\" and money going out as a \\"debit.\\" This way, people can easily understand how much money they have and what they are spending it on."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You can also mix lemon juice or vinegar with water and use it as a spray to clean surfaces. 4. Boil water with lemon or vinegar: Fill a pot with water, add some lemon slices or a cup of vinegar, and let it boil for a few minutes. The steam from the boiling water helps to remove fishy smells from the air. 5.

Below the melting polar ice caps, a 200-foot-long praying mantis, trapped in the ice for millions of years, begins to stir.  Soon after, the military personnel at Red Eagle One, a military station in northern Canada that monitors information gathered from the Distant Early Warning Line, realize that the men at one of their outposts are not responding to calls.  Commanding officer Col. Joe Parkman flies there to investigate, and finds the post destroyed, its men gone, and giant slashes left in the snow outside. When a radar blip is sighted, Joe sends his pilots out to investigate, but their intended target disappears. Soon an Air Force plane is attacked by the deadly mantis.  He searches the wreckage, and this time, in addition to the huge slashes, finds a five-foot-long pointed object in the snow.  He takes it to General Mark Ford at the Continental Air Defense in Colorado Springs, Colorado.  Ford gathers top scientists, including Professor Anton Gunther, to examine the object, but when they cannot identify it, Gunther recommends calling in Dr. Nedrick Jackson, a paleontologist at the Museum of Natural History. When Ned gets the call from Ford, he is helping museum magazine editor Marge Blaine plan her next issue, and dodges her questions as she begs him for a big scoop.  Later, after examining the object, Ned recognizes it as a torn-off spur from an insect's leg, and soon guesses, from evidence that the creature ate human flesh, that it must be a gigantic praying mantis.

We will leave only when you pull closer to the European Union, when you change the constitution, when you alter the government's power structure, they have loudly insisted. But why? Why have thousands of protesters staked their lives, seemingly, on their desire for political change? And why has the government resisted their calls so vehemently? Let's take a look: 1. What prompted the protests? At the heart of the protests is a trade pact. For a year, President Viktor Yanukovych insisted he was intent on signing a historical political and trade agreement with the European Union. But on November 21, he decided to suspend talks with the EU. They took to the streets, demanding that OPTIONS: - EU sign the EU deal. - European Union sign the EU deal. - Independence Square sign the EU deal. - Kiev sign the EU deal. - Maidan sign the EU deal. - Russia sign the EU deal. - Ukraine sign the EU deal. - Viktor Yanukovych sign the EU deal. - West sign the EU deal.","output":"Correct Answer(s):  - Ukraine sign the EU deal. - Viktor Yanukovych sign the EU deal. Explanation: The protests were prompted by President Viktor Yanukovych's decision to suspend talks with the EU about signing a historical political and trade agreement. Therefore, the protesters demanded that Ukraine (represented by President Viktor Yanukovych) sign the EU deal.  Now, let's consider why the other options are incorrect: - The European Union (EU), in this context, is the body Ukraine would be signing an agreement with, not the one expected to sign the EU deal.  - Independence Square, Kiev, and Maidan are geographic locations and cannot sign a deal.  - Russia is not directly involved in the situation described - the issue was between Ukraine and the EU. - The 'West' is too broad and ambiguous in this context. In international relations, the 'West' often refers to countries with shared democratic values, but it's not accurate or specific in this context. - Protester's demands were directed towards their own country's government (represented by Viktor Yanukovych), not the EU or other entities. Therefore, saying that they demanded the EU, Russian or West to sign the deal is incorrect."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Roy Barnes will spend his first day as a private citizen by starting his new job as a full-time, pro-bono (unpaid) lawyer at the Atlanta Legal Aid Society. The decision by Barnes, the most improbable casualty of Election Day 2002, to go to work for legal aid was almost as unexpected as his November defeat. As a legal services attorney, Barnes will help women escape domestic violence, Mauricio Vivero is vice president seniors fight predatory lending scams and parents obtain child support for their kids. of Legal In doing so, he will take his place on the front line of the U.S. legal community's Services Corporation, the uphill and underpublicized struggle to achieve equal access to justice for millions of Washington-Americans too poor to afford legal representation. based nonprofit corporation chartered by The inaccessibility of the U.S. civil justice system is hardly a new development, but it Congress in took Barnes' decision to put the national media spotlight on our country's ongoing 1974 to promote equal access to access-to-justice crisis. civil justice. The 2000 U.S. census reports that more than 43 million Americans qualify for free federally funded legal assistance, yet fewer than 20 percent of eligible clients (annual income: 11,075 or less) are able to obtain legal help when they need it, according to the American Bar Association. In Georgia, there is just one legal aid lawyer for every 10,500 eligible poor people. Barnes understood this problem long before he became governor. While in private practice, he handled many pro-bono cases and was a frequent volunteer in the Cobb County office of the federally funded Atlanta Legal Aid Society. Most memorably, he secured a 115 million judgment in 1993 against Fleet Finance for victimizing 18,000 homeowners -- many of them senior citizens -- with its widespread predatory lending mortgage practices. His long-standing commitment to the underserved is certainly admirable, but it should not be viewed as a rare and laudable act of civic virtue. To be admitted to practice law, every attorney must take a professional oath to promote justice -- and every state's ethical rules include language indicating lawyers' responsibility to be guardians of fair play for those living in poverty. In Georgia, many law firms, corporations and private attorneys are working pro bono to serve the neediest clients. Yet only 23 percent of the state's 23,598 active lawyers reported meeting the Georgia State Bar's goal of 50 hours of pro-bono service in 2002. The need for volunteers is most severe outside the five-county Atlanta metropolitan area, where 70 percent of the state's poor people are served by only 24 percent of the state's lawyers. National pro-bono participation is even worse. Only 23 percent of the roughly 1 million attorneys in America volunteer even one hour of pro-bono service annually, according to the ABA.

Does the response correctly answer the question?","output":"No. The response does not correctly answer the question.

The soldiers were proper and kept the vests but not the boots because the  Possible answers: I. vests were wrong. II. boots were wrong.","output":"The soldiers were proper and kept the vests but not the boots because of multiple factors that contributed to the decision-making process during their meticulous planning and execution. The reasons for choosing the vests over the boots can be classified under two primary headings: 1. Functional Utility: The soldiers, who were clad in their battle-hardened gear, found the vests to be more advantageous when it came to fulfilling their tactical objectives. The vests provided them with ample protection, enhanced mobility, and the flexibility required to adapt to rapidly evolving scenarios on the battlefield. With the integration of advanced materials and designs, the vests effectively shielded the soldiers from enemy fire and minimized injuries. Additionally, these vests facilitated the ideal weight distribution for carrying an extensive range of equipment and ammunition, thereby enabling the soldiers to partake in intensive combat operations while reducing fatigue. On the other hand, the boots failed to cater to the specific requirements and expectations of the soldiers. With prolonged use and exposure to harsh environmental conditions, the boots demonstrated shortcomings in terms of durability and resilience. Moreover, the subpar quality construction and absence of a suitable support system rendered the boots uncomfortable and incompatible with the intense physical demands of combat. This resulted in the soldiers opting against using the boots, as they were unsuitable for facilitating optimal performance. 2. Adaptation to Terrain: Varying geographical terrains played a pivotal role in influencing the soldiers' decision to keep the vests and discard the boots. The vests, being fundamental to their standard operational gear, facilitated seamless maneuverability and adaptability for diverse terrains and topographies. The adjustable and modular design of these vests further enabled the soldiers to modify their gear as per the unpredictability of the battlefield. In contrast, the boots were unable to cater to the adaptive nature required for traversing through different terrains. The suboptimal design, coupled with the lack of waterproofing, breathability, and insulation features, rendered the boots inefficient for withstanding diverse and extreme climatic conditions. Additionally, the undersized and rigid structure of the boots hampered the soldiers' ability to negotiate challenging obstacles and negotiate difficult terrains, thereby significantly diminishing their capability to adopt tailored combat strategies effectively. In conclusion, the soldiers made a calculated decision to retain the vests and abandon the boots based on the two essential factors mentioned above. The vests proved to be superior in terms of functional utility, securely protecting the soldiers while allowing them to carry vital equipment with ease. Moreover, the vests aided the soldiers in adapting effortlessly to the dynamic battle terrains, thus ensuring the flawless execution of their operations. Conversely, the boots were deemed ineffective both in design and utility, affecting the soldiers' comfort and adaptability in challenging combat conditions, which ultimately led to their unanimous rejection."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I find it heart-warming and inspiring that the writing team behind such hopelessly mainstream Hollywood movies like INDIANA JONES AND THE TEMPLE OF DOOM, American Graffiti and HOWARD THE DUCK would begin their career with a low-budget exploitation horror film like this. Perhaps as a testament to the talent that would earn Willard Hyuck and Gloria Katz an Oscar nomination later in their respective careers, Messiah of Evil has potential, but sadly becomes frustrating exactly because it can't muster the film-making prowess to pull it off. The premise involves a young girl who travels to a small coastal town in search for her painter father who went missing a while back. It doesn't take long for the fragmented narrative to abandon all hope and dive headlong in disjointed absurdity - and for a while it works admirably well to the point where you begin thinking that maybe Messiah of Evil needs to be reclaimed from the schlocky gutter of 70's exploitation as an example of artful mystery horror. The surreal non-sequiturs keep piling on as the daughter stumbles upon a young couple in a seedy hotel room who are in town to conduct a research on the local legend of the 'blood moon', a scruffy and half-mad alcoholic (played by the great Elisha Cook Jr. in perhaps the best scene of the movie) who warns her about her father only to be reportedly found dead in an alley 'eaten by dogs' a little later, the blind old lady that owns the local art gallery and who has inexplicably removed all of her father's paintings from the shop and last but not least a retarded, murderous, squirrel-eating albino. Part of the movie's charm is precisely this brand of bargain-basement artsy surrealism that defies logic and genre conventions every step of the way. Whereas with Lynch it is obviously the mark of a talented creator, with Messiah of Evil the boundaries between the 'intentional', the 'unintentional' and the 'didn't really expect it to come out this way but it's good enough - WRAP SCENE' blur hopelessly. Take for example the double narration that flows in and out of the picture in a drug-addled, feverish, stream-of-consciousness way, one coming from the daughter as she wanders from place to place in search for her father, and the other narrated by her father's voice as she reads his diary.  While we're still talking about a 'living dead' picture, Messiah of Evil is different and only loosely one - at least with current preconceptions of what a zombie movie is supposed to be. The origin of the living dead here is a 100 year old curse, bestowed upon the town by a mysterious 'Dark Stranger' who came from the woods one day. In the meantime Hyuck finds time for snippets of mass-consumption criticism in a flesh-eating supermarket scene that predates DAWN OF THE DEAD by a good number of years (you can hear the MST3K line already: 'man is dead, only his capitalist food tins remain') and a nicely thought but poorly executed similar scene in a movie theater. I generally think that the surreal works in careful, well measured doses - how is the absurd to work if it's not hidden within the perfectly normal? Hyuck seems to just smear it all over the picture and by doing so dangerously overplays his hand. When the albino for example picks up a girl hitching her way to town and eats a squirrel in front of her, you can almost imagine the director winking meaningfully at the audience, amused and satisfied with his own hijinks.  The general film-making level is also pretty low - after the half-way mark, the pace becomes muddled and the story tiresome and evidently going nowhere and not particularly fast either. Add to that the choppy editing, average acting and Hyuck's general inability to capture true atmosphere - the empty streets of coastal town are criminally misused - and I'd file Messiah under 'missed opportunity' but still grindhouse afficionados will find enough to appreciate - even though it's not particularly gory, trashy or sleazy.

Q:Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the full name of the man who was the engineer on the album that had the spirit of experimentation?  In his book about psychedelic music, author Jim DeRogatis referred to Smiley Smile as a work of the \\"ultimate psychedelic rock library\\". Conversely, Stylus Magazine's Edwin Faust wrote in 2003 that the album \\"embraces the listener with a drugged out sincerity; a feat never accomplished by the more pretentious and heavy-handed psychedelia of that era. It is for this reason Smiley Smile flows so well with the more experimental pop of today\\". According to music theorist Daniel Harrison, Smiley Smile is not a work of rock music as the term was understood in 1967, and that portions of the album \\"can be thought of as a kind of protomiminal rock music\\". He continues: Smiley Smile can almost be considered a work of art music in the Western classical tradition, and its innovations in the musical language of rock can be compared to those that introduced atonal and other nontraditional techniques into that classical tradition. The spirit of experimentation is just as palpable in Smiley Smile as it is in, say, Schoenberg's op. 11 piano pieces. Yet there is also a spirit of tentativeness in Smiley Smile. We must remember that it was essentially a Plan B—that is, the album issued instead of Smile. The Beach Boys recorded using what was predominantly radio broadcasting equipment, which lacked many of the technical elements and effects found in an established studio. This led to unconventional ways of achieving particular sounds at the home, such as a replacement for what would be achieved by an echo chamber. The album's engineer Jim Lockert recalled how \\"Brian's swimming pool had a leak in it and was empty, so we put a microphone in the bottom of this damn near Olympic-size pool and the guys laid down inside the pool and sang so the sound would go down the wall of the concrete pool into the microphone – and that was part of the vocals on one of those songs.\\" Some recording accidents were used to their advantage, such as in \\"With Me Tonight\\", which contains an informal link between the verse and chorus by way of a voice...

Plot title: Blood Bath Movie plot: In Venice, California, student Daisy (Merissa Mathes) leaves a club alone after having an argument with her beatnik boyfriend Max (Carl Schanzer). Walking through the deserted streets, she stops to admire some gruesome paintings in a gallery window painted by artist Antonio Sordi (Campbell), who coincidentally also comes by to look in on his \\"lost children.\\" After a friendly conversation, Sordi convinces the young woman to pose nude for him that night. At his bell-tower studio, Sordi is possessed by the spirit of a long-dead ancestor and suddenly transforms into a vampiric monster who hacks the screaming Daisy to death with a cleaver. Afterwards, he lowers her mutilated corpse into a vat of boiling wax. Sordi, in his vampire form, stalks Venice in search of victims; he is able to do so freely at all hours. In the middle of the day, he chases a young woman into the surf at a beach and drowns her. At night, he kills a prostitute in a car while pedestrians stroll by, all of them assuming the pair are lovers sharing an intimate moment. Another victim is approached at a party, chased into a swimming pool, and drowned there after the other guests have moved into the house. The murdered women are carried back to Sordi's studio and painted by the artist, their bodies then covered in wax. Max wants to make up with Daisy but cannot find her anywhere. Learning that she has posed for Sordi and become the subject of the latest in the artist's series of \\"Dead Red Nudes,\\" he visits her sister Donna (Sandra Knight) to ask her forgiveness. Donna tells Max she hasn't seen Daisy for days, and is concerned about the recent rash of disappearances. She reads Max the legend of Sordi's 15th-century ancestor Erno, a painter condemned to be burned at the stake for capturing his subjects' souls on canvas. Unable to convince Max that Antonio Sordi might also be a vampire, she confronts the artist at his studio and asks him if he has seen Daisy. He angrily brushes her off. That night, he later follows her through the streets and murders... My question: Who plays Donna ? Answer:","output":"Sandra Knight plays Donna."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Can you tell me the answer to who is the prophet who was thrown into the sea and swallowed by the whale??","output":"The prophet who was thrown into the sea and subsequently swallowed by a whale (or a big fish) is Jonah. His story is narrated in the religious texts of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. In the Hebrew Bible, his story is found in the Book of Jonah, while in the Christian New Testament it is referred to in the Gospel of Matthew. In Islam, his tale is detailed in the Quran, where he is known as Yunus or Dhul-Nun. Jonah was a prophet of God who was commanded to convey a message to the people of Nineveh, an ancient city located in present-day Iraq. The people of Nineveh were known for their wickedness and idolatry, and God wanted Jonah to warn them to repent and follow the righteous path, or else they would face divine destruction. However, Jonah was reluctant to follow God's command because he doubted that the people of Nineveh would heed his warnings and amend their ways. Fearing their hostility, he attempted to escape his mission by boarding a ship bound for Tarshish, a city far in the opposite direction. As the ship sailed, a severe storm arose at sea, and the panicked sailors began praying to their gods for mercy. Believing that the storm was the result of divine anger against someone on board, they cast lots to identify the guilty party. The lot fell upon Jonah, and the sailors realized it was because of him the storm had been unleashed. Jonah admitted that he was fleeing from God's command and suggested that the sailors throw him into the sea to calm the storm. Reluctantly, the sailors complied and cast him overboard. Miraculously, the sea immediately grew calm.  Meanwhile, Jonah was swallowed by a whale (or a big fish) sent by God to protect him from drowning. It is worth noting that in Islamic tradition, the swallowing of Jonah is seen as a divine punishment rather than a rescue. Jonah remained in the belly of the whale for three days and nights (some interpretations vary on the duration). While in the whale, Jonah prayed to God for forgiveness and acknowledged his wrongdoing. He realized the gravity of avoiding his responsibilities as a prophet and pledged to correct his actions.  God heard Jonah's supplications and commanded the whale to release him onto the shore. Jonah was then given a second chance to carry out his mission. He went to Nineveh and warned the people of their impending doom if they did not repent. To his surprise, they heeded his message and turned to God for forgiveness, showing genuine remorse for their past actions. Upon witnessing this unexpected change of heart, God chose to spare Nineveh from destruction. This merciful act served as a lesson for Jonah as well, illustrating the depth of God's compassion and forgiveness. The story of Jonah ultimately emphasizes the importance of obedience to divine command, repentance, and God's boundless mercy for both the prophet and the people he was sent to save."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Nelson was on a mission to ruin Michael 's career because","output":"Nelson was on a mission to ruin Michael's career because, over the years, a deep-seated grudge had developed between them, stemming from a series of professional and personal disputes that had turned the once-amiable colleagues into bitter rivals. During their early professional years, Michael and Nelson started as ambitious, energetic, and talented young employees at an up-and-coming marketing firm. Michael, a gifted public speaker with a knack for persuading people, excelled in developing relationships with clients, quickly solidifying the company's reputation as a reliable partner for fostering brand growth. Nelson, on the other hand, was a creative genius who was responsible for most of the firm's innovative and avant-garde marketing campaigns that propelled the company to new heights. As both men continued to excel in their respective roles, they developed a sense of rivalry and began to harbor a fierce competitive streak. However, it remained largely unspoken and nothing more than friendly banter, as the pair recognized their mutual talent. For years, the healthy competition between Michael and Nelson helped bring about greater success for the company and individual recognition for both of them. Unfortunately, the tipping point of their rivalry occurred at the company's annual conference when Michael was awarded the title of 'Employee of the Year'. Nelson, despite his many extraordinary accomplishments, was overlooked for the accolade. This enraged Nelson, who felt that his contributions had not only been underappreciated but also deliberately ignored. Feeling slighted, Nelson began to harbor resentment towards Michael, which led him to undermine his success at every turn. From spreading gossip among their colleagues to belittling Michael's achievements, Nelson used any opportunity to tarnish Michael's reputation. However, this covert rivalry remained unknown to Michael, enabling Nelson to continue his acts of sabotage surreptitiously. One day, Nelson came across an opportunity to make a significant impact. He learned of a lucrative client that Michael was tasked to impress and sign with the firm. Realizing the gravity of this responsibility for Michael's career, Nelson devised a plan to not only ruin the project but also to target Michael's credibility as a valued employee at the company. Nelson began his ploy by constructing a fake email correspondence between Michael and a competing client designed to look like Michael was giving away sensitive marketing strategies. Then, he managed to acquire a copy of the presentation Michael had prepared, where Nelson made subtle changes that appeared unprofessional and even offensive. Nelson also circulated a rumor that Michael was planning to leave the firm, casting doubts on Michael's loyalty and intentions. On the day of the crucial meeting, with a mixture of fear and anticipation, Nelson walked into the board room to witness the downfall of his nemesis. As Michael's presentation unfolded with the numerous changes and inaccuracies, the clients became increasingly agitated and confused, negatively affecting the meeting's atmosphere. The fallout from this disastrous event was as devastating as Nelson had envisioned. The firm did not secure the esteemed client, and Michael's reputation suffered an immense hit. The management called for an immediate investigation into the matter that uncovered the fabricated emails, which further destroyed Michael's credibility. In the end, Nelson's malicious efforts to ruin Michael's career were successful, and the once-promising speaker and firm advocate was fired. Unbeknownst to those involved, Nelson's thirst for revenge drove him to bury his rival's career, leaving a trail of destruction and disappointment in its wake. Michael, a victim of Nelson's envy and rage, was left with little but his shattered ambitions and a tarnished reputation, wondering how everything went so terribly wrong so fast."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

She is a pupil in a primary school. She works hard at her subjects. In class, she takes an active part in all kinds of activities. She looks smarter than her classmates. One day, she was doing her homework after supper as usual. Her father was not in. Her mother was taking a shower in the bathroom. After she finished her homework, Millie asked her mother to check it for her, but her mother didn't answer her. A few minutes later, her mother was still in the bathroom. Millie felt strange. She knocked at the door. But her mother had no answer. She pushed the door open and found her mother lying on the floor. At the same time, she smelled something terrible. It was the gas. She quickly opened the window, turned off the gas and called 120 and 110 for help. Soon some doctors and policemen came and sent her mother to the nearest hospital. Her mother was saved at last. Why did the little girl know how to do that? That was because she had learned how to save herself and others in danger in school. Question: Why didn't her mother answer her?

Q: Passage: Monteux first conducted the San Francisco Symphony Orchestra (SFSO) in 1931, and in 1935 at the age of 60 he was offered the chief conductorship. He was doubtful about accepting, both on personal and on professional grounds. He did not want to leave the OSP, his wife did not want to live on the west coast of America, and the orchestra was so low in funds that it had been forced to cancel an entire season in 1934. Like most orchestras the SFSO had been badly hit financially by the depression, and it suffered the further difficulty that many of its former players had left for better-paid jobs in Hollywood studios. That problem was exacerbated by the insistence of the Musicians' Union that only local players could be recruited. Monteux nevertheless accepted the appointment. The SFSO concert season was never longer than five months a year, which enabled him to continue working with the OSP, and allowed him to conduct the inaugural concert of the NBC Symphony Orchestra on 13 November 1937. In The New York Times Olin Downes wrote that the new orchestra was \\"of very high rank\\" and that the broadcast concert had displayed Monteux \\"at the height of his powers.\\"The Times said of Monteux's time in San Francisco that it had \\"incalculable effect on American musical culture\\", and gave him \\"the opportunity to expand his already substantial repertory, and by gradual, natural processes to deepen his understanding of his art.\\" Monteux consistently programmed new or recent music. He generally avoided, as he did throughout his career, atonal or serial works, but his choice of modern works nevertheless drew occasional complaints from conservative-minded members of the San Francisco audience. Among guest conductors with the SFSO during Monteux's years were John Barbirolli, Beecham, Otto Klemperer, Stokowski and Stravinsky. Soloists included the pianists George Gershwin, Rachmaninoff, Arthur Rubinstein and Schnabel, the violinists Jascha Heifetz, Yehudi Menuhin and the young Isaac Stern, and singers such as Kirsten Flagstad and Alexander Kipnis.

She was the second daughter and youngest child born to King Lysimachus from his first wife, Nicaea of Macedon. Arsinoe I had two older siblings: a brother called Agathocles and a sister called Eurydice.  - Agathocles ( Greek :  ; born between 320 -- 310s BC -- died 284 BC ) was a Greek Prince who was of Macedonian and Thessalian descent . He was the son born to Lysimachus from his first wife the Queen consort , Nicaea a daughter of the powerful regent Antipater . His full blooded siblings were his younger sisters : Eurydice and Arsinoe I. Agathocles was sent by his father against the Getae , about 292 BC , but was defeated and taken prisoner . He was kindly treated by Dromichaetes the king of the Getae , and sent back to his father with presents ; but Lysimachus , notwithstanding , marched against the Getae , and was taken prisoner himself . He too was also released by Dromichaetes , who received in consequence the daughter of Lysimachus in marriage . According to some authors it was only Agathocles and according to others only Lysimachus , who was taken prisoner . In 287 BC Agathocles was sent by his father against Demetrius I Poliorcetes , who had marched into Anatolia to deprive Lysimachus of Lydia and Caria . In this expedition he was successful ; he defeated Demetrius I and drove him out of his father 's provinces . Agathocles was destined to be the successor of Lysimachus , and was popular among his subjects . His stepmother Arsinoe II , prejudiced the mind of his father against him and after an unsuccessful attempt to poison him , Lysimachus cast him into prison and had him executed ( 284 BC ) . His maternal cousin - wife and now widow Lysandra with their children fled with Alexander ( Agathocles ' paternal half - brother ) to Seleucus I Nicator in Syria , who made war upon Lysimachus in consequence . Louis Robert has suggested that coins  of 300 BC belong to an Agathocleia city in Mysia founded by Agathocles .  - Brunei, officially the Nation of Brunei, the Abode of Peace (Jawi: ), is a sovereign state located on the north coast of the island of Borneo in Southeast Asia. Apart from its coastline with the South China Sea, the country is completely surrounded by the state of Sarawak, Malaysia. It is separated into two parts by the Sarawak district of Limbang. Brunei is the only sovereign state completely on the island of Borneo; the remainder of the island's territory is divided between the nations of Malaysia and Indonesia. Brunei's population was 408,786 in July 2012.  - A queen consort is the wife of a reigning king (or an empress consort in the case of an emperor). In Brunei, the wife of the Sultan is known as a \\"Raja Isteri\\" with prefix \\"Pengiran Anak\\", equivalent with queen consort in English, as were the consorts of tsars when Bulgaria was still a monarchy. A queen consort usually shares her husband's social rank and status. She holds the feminine equivalent of the king's monarchical titles, but historically, she does not share the king's political and military powers. A queen regnant is a queen in her own right with all the powers of a monarch, who (usually) has become queen by inheriting the throne upon the death of the previous monarch.  - Lysimachus (Greek: , \\"Lysimachos\\"; c. 360 BC  281 BC) was a Macedonian officer and diadochus (i.e. \\"successor\\") of Alexander the Great, who became a basileus (\\"King\\") in 306 BC, ruling Thrace, Asia Minor and Macedon.  - Alexander III of Macedon (20/21 July 356 BC  10/11 June 323 BC), commonly known as Alexander the Great (\\"Aléxandros ho Mégas\\" ), was a king (\\"basileus\\") of the Ancient Greek kingdom of Macedon and a member of the Argead dynasty. Born in Pella in 356 BC, Alexander succeeded his father, Philip II, to the throne at the age of twenty. He spent most of his ruling years on an unprecedented military campaign through Asia and northeast Africa, and by the age of thirty he had created one of the largest empires of the ancient world, stretching from Greece to northwestern India. He was undefeated in battle and is widely considered one of history's most successful military commanders.    What is the relationship between 'agathocles ' and 'nicaea of macedon'? The answer is:","output":"Agathocles and Nicaea of Macedon were mother and son. Nicaea of Macedon was the first wife of King Lysimachus and the mother of Agathocles, who was a Greek Prince of Macedonian and Thessalian descent. Nicaea was the daughter of the powerful regent Antipater, making her a prominent figure in the Macedonian royal family. Agathocles was born between 320 and 310s BC and was the elder brother of Arsinoe I and Eurydice. As a prince, he played an active role in his father's kingdom, engaging in military campaigns and diplomatic affairs. However, his life was marked by tragedy, as he was eventually executed by his father in 284 BC under the influence of his stepmother, Arsinoe II.

After becoming disabled in a machete attack on a visit to his native Haiti, Jean-Claude Joseph needed help persuading his landlord to move him from a fifth-floor apartment to one on the ground floor. Isaac Benjamin became ensnared in a bureaucratic snafu that took away his Social Security disability payments for more than two years. The story of Martha, a woman from Sierra Leone, was more compelling. Beaten, raped and tortured in her politically repressive homeland, she knowingly used someone else's passport to escape to America, but was caught by immigration authorities upon her arrival. She desperately sought political asylum. Not the kind of cases that lead to ground-breaking upheavals in the law, but the kind of cases that are handled day in and day out by lawyers for the legally disenfranchised who have no where else to turn. The work of attorneys from Legal Services of New Jersey will be highlighted in a onehour documentary, \\"Quest for Justice,\\" to be aired 9 p.m. today on New Jersey Network. Produced by NYD2, a communications firm based in Somerset, the documentary features case histories of clients whose needs ranged from housing to fighting off deportation. Joseph, a 54-year-old naturalized citizen, turned to Legal Services when the landlord of his federally subsidized apartment complex in Elizabeth turned a deaf ear to his request for a ground-floor apartment. Having lost the use of his left arm in warding off the machete attack during a robbery attempt, Joseph said he found it increasingly difficult to negotiate the five flights of stairs lugging groceries or laundry on the frequent occasions when the building's elevator was out of order. \\"With this, it became impossible for me to stay upstairs,\\" he said, pointing to the scars on his forearm. \\"If I cannot carry my groceries or my laundry, how can I live?\\" \\"It was a compelling case,\\" said Legal Services attorney Stephen St. Hilaire. \\"The key for us -- and we have to make tough decisions all the time on whether to take a case -- was visualizing what he had to do to get to the fifth floor, struggling with a bag of groceries,\\" he said.

Movie title: Reign Over Me Context: Mike Binder wrote and directed this melodrama about two men who meet after a long break in their friendship and struggle to help each other rebuild their lives. Don Cheadle is Alan Johnson, a dentist who feels smothered and unfulfilled by his comfortable life or beautiful wife (Jada Pinkett Smith), when chance brings him across his former college roommate, Charlie Fineman (Adam Sandler). Fineman lost his entire family on 9/11 and in the years that have ensued, he has completely isolated himself in a child-like existence. Refusing to acknowledge his past or the tragedy that is too horrible to even think about, Charlie is constantly listening to music, playing video games, watching movies, and banging on his drums. Alan finds himself beginning to enjoy life again in Charlie's child-like presence, but as he realizes the extent of the pain that ravages Charlie he starts to attempt to help Charlie face his past and return to the real world. Also woven into the story are the sensitive psychologist Angela Oakhurst (an excellent Liv Tyler) and a beautiful but confused woman named Donna Remar (Saffron Burows), who is struggling with her divorce. Binder himself stars in an excellent performance as Bryan Sugarman, a lawyer who was Charlie's friend before 9/11, and who Charlie now refuses to acknowledge or speak with. However, he has devoted himself to protecting Charlie's finances, living situation, and general peace-of mind.After working with Dr. Oakhurst, Charlie is able to begin to acknowledge the deaths of his wife and three daughters. However, the trauma of this memory nearly drives him to suicide, and after a brief stay at a mental hospital, his parents-in-law attempt to commit him permanently. Donald Sutherland and B.J. Novak appear for a courtroom scene, after which Charlie is allowed to be free and to attempt to continue slowly building a new life, with the aid of his friends and loved ones.

I asked him where he was going. He said “I’m going to fail this class anyway, so I have other things to do.” It was true that he wasn’t doing well, and we had addressed this previously, but his attitude was completely defeatist. He had given up. So, there, in the middle of class, before he could get away, I said “Well, yeah. You will certainly fail if you don’t even try. I thought you were graduating at the end of this semester.” “I’m supposed to, but I won’t, because I’m going to fail physics. All I need is a D.” (He was right; his major didn’t require knowing any physics but they put it in the curriculum as a kind of gatekeeper course. Most students took physics much earlier in their studies than he did.) “If you have already decided to fail, I can’t stop you; you’re an adult. But you can make an appointment with me anytime. You already know that. You can email me. It’s my job to help you understand, but you have to come to me. You are an adult. It would be very inappropriate of me to follow you around, inviting you to office hours. And you must do the homework and the labs.” He stayed for the lab. I notified his counselor about what was going on, and she called him in and said the same things that I said.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize this article: There are two main types of hair extensions: synthetic and real hair. Synthetic extensions are cheaper, and readily found in beauty supply stores and \\"punk\\" stores, such as Hot Topic or Clairs. Real hair extensions are more expensive, and can be found in salons and beauty-supply stores. Unlike synthetic extensions, they can be straightened and curled. Some synthetic hair extensions are heat safe. The packaging will usually indicate up to what temperature it is safe to curl or straighten the hair. Decide where you want the streak, then slide the handle of a rat-tail comb through your hair, and use it to create a part. You never want to add an extension to the top of your head, because the comb and weft will be visible. Clip your hair out of the way, if needed. Find the comb part, and turn it so that the hair is facing you. Hold the comb between your thumbs and forefingers. Push down on the middle of the comb with one of your thumbs. You'll feel it click as it opens. Turn the extension so that the comb part is facing your head. Slide the comb into your hair, right below the part you made. Make sure that the teeth are catching in your hair. Press down on the sides of the extension with your fingers. You'll feel it snap shut against your head. If the extension is too long, you can cut it so that it matches the length of your natural hair. If you used an extension made from real hair, you can curl it or straighten it to match your hair texture.  Cut upwards into the strand to thin out the ends and make them lay like real hair. Use a lower heat setting on your straightener or curling iron. A high-heat setting can damage an extension, even if it's made from real hair. Your hair will now cover the clip from the extension, making it look more realistic. At the end of the day, be sure to take the extension out. Summary:","output":"The article discusses the two primary types of hair extensions: synthetic and real hair. Synthetic extensions are more affordable and widely available in beauty supply stores and alternative shops like Hot Topic or Clairs, whereas real hair extensions are costlier and can be found in salons and beauty supply stores. Real hair extensions have the advantage of being suitable for styling with heat, unlike most synthetic ones, although some synthetic extensions are heat safe as indicated on their packaging. To apply a hair extension, use a rat-tail comb to create a part where you want the streak but not on the top of your head to avoid visibility. Clip excess hair out of the way, and hold the comb part of the extension facing you. Open the comb by pushing down and then turn it towards your head, sliding it into place right below the part, ensuring the teeth catch in your hair. Press down on the sides to snap it shut securely. If necessary, trim the extension to match your natural hair length. For real hair extensions, you can curl or straighten them to match your hair texture; just make sure to use a low heat setting to prevent damage. Thinning out the ends can also help the extension blend more naturally with your hair. Always remember to remove the extension at the end of the day."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","output":"One year for a planet refers to the time it takes for that particular celestial body to complete one full orbit around its star. In the context of Earth, one year is equivalent to approximately 365.25 days, during which our planet revolves around the Sun. However, the answer provided - \\"It is also the largest of the Solar System's four terrestrial planets.\\" - is not an appropriate response to the question since it refers to another concept. The phrase is describing Earth's size in comparison to the other rocky terrestrial planets in our Solar System - Mercury, Venus, and Mars. This information is unrelated to the concept of what one year means to a planet. A more fitting answer to the question would be as follows: \\"To the planet Earth, one year signifies the duration of time it takes to complete a full orbit around the Sun. This period equates to approximately 365.25 days, during which the Earth experiences different seasons due to its axial tilt. The concept of a year is used to measure time, and it helps us understand climate shifts, seasonal patterns, and the way life on Earth has evolved and adapted over time.\\" This answer addresses the connection between one year and a planet's orbit around its star while also highlighting the significance of this time period in relation to Earth's seasons, climate, and ecosystem."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Although a great deal of text is still stored in legacy encodings, Unicode is used almost exclusively for building new information processing systems. Early adopters tended to use UCS-2 (the fixed-width two-byte precursor to UTF-16) and later moved to UTF-16 (the variable-width current standard), as this was the least disruptive way to add support for non-BMP characters. The best known such system is Windows NT (and its descendants, Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Vista and Windows 7), which uses UTF-16 as the sole internal character encoding.

Q:The following article contains an answer for the question: What concert tour did critics say was overproduced? , can you please find it?   Tonight (1984), another dance-oriented album, found Bowie collaborating with Tina Turner and, once again, Iggy Pop. It included a number of cover songs, among them the 1966 Beach Boys hit \\"God Only Knows\\". The album bore the transatlantic Top 10 hit \\"Blue Jean\\", itself the inspiration for a short film that won Bowie a Grammy Award for Best Short Form Music Video, Jazzin' for Blue Jean. Bowie performed at Wembley Stadium in 1985 for Live Aid, a multi-venue benefit concert for Ethiopian famine relief. During the event, the video for a fundraising single was premiered, Bowie's duet with Mick Jagger. \\"Dancing in the Street\\" quickly went to number one on release. The same year, Bowie worked with the Pat Metheny Group to record \\"This Is Not America\\" for the soundtrack of The Falcon and the Snowman. Released as a single, the song became a Top 40 hit in the UK and US.Bowie was given a role in the 1986 film Absolute Beginners. It was poorly received by critics, but Bowie's theme song, also named \\"Absolute Beginners\\", rose to No. 2 in the UK charts. He also appeared as Jareth, the Goblin King, in the 1986 Jim Henson film Labyrinth, for which he wrote five songs. His final solo album of the decade was 1987's Never Let Me Down, where he ditched the light sound of his previous two albums, instead offering harder rock with an industrial/techno dance edge. Peaking at No. 6 in the UK, the album yielded the hits \\"Day-In, Day-Out\\" (his 60th single), \\"Time Will Crawl\\", and \\"Never Let Me Down\\". Bowie later described it as his \\"nadir\\", calling it \\"an awful album\\". Supporting Never Let Me Down, and preceded by nine promotional press shows, the 86-concert Glass Spider Tour commenced on 30 May. Bowie's backing band included Peter Frampton on lead guitar. Contemporary critics maligned the tour as overproduced, saying it pandered to the current stadium rock trends in its special effects and dancing, although years after the tour's conclusion, critics acknowledged that the tour influenced how other artists performed concerts, including...

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Information:  - Common law (also known as case law or precedent) is law developed by judges, courts, and similar tribunals, stated in decisions that nominally decide individual cases but that in addition have precedential effect on future cases. Common law is a third branch of law, in contrast to and on equal footing with statutes which are adopted through the legislative process, and regulations which are promulgated by the executive branch. In cases where the parties disagree on what the law is, a common law court looks to past precedential decisions of relevant courts. If a similar dispute has been resolved in the past, the court is usually bound to follow the reasoning used in the prior decision (a principle known as \\"stare decisis\\"). If, however, the court finds that the current dispute is fundamentally distinct from all previous cases (called a \\"matter of first impression\\"), judges have the authority and duty to resolve the issue (one party or the other has to win, and on disagreements of law, judges make that decision). Resolution of the issue in one case becomes precedent that binds future courts. \\"Stare decisis\\", the principle that cases should be decided according to consistent principled rules so that similar facts will yield similar results, lies at the heart of all common law systems.  - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union.  - Case law is the set of existing rulings which made new interpretations of law and, therefore, can be cited as precedents. In some countries, such as the United States, the term is exclusively used for judicial decisions of selected appellate courts, courts of first instance, and other bodies discharging judicial functions. In other countries, such as most European countries, the term is applied to any set of rulings on law which is guided by previous rulings, for example, \\"patent office case law\\". These interpretations are distinguished from statutory law which are the statutes and codes enacted by legislative bodies; regulatory law which are regulations established by governmental agencies based on statutes; and in some states, common law which are the generally accepted laws carried to the colonies and former colonies of England (USA, Australia, etc.). Trials and hearings which are not selected as 'courts of first impression' do not have rulings that become case law; therefore, these rulings cannot be precedents for future court decisions.  - Habeas corpus (Medieval Latin meaning literally \\"You may have the body\\") is a recourse in law whereby a person can report an unlawful detention or imprisonment before a court, usually through a prison official.  - An Order in Council is a type of legislation in many countries, especially the Commonwealth realms. In the United Kingdom this legislation is formally made in the name of the Queen by and with the advice and consent of the Privy Council (\\"Queen-in-Council\\"), but in other countries the terminology may vary. The term should not be confused with Order of Council, which is made in the name of the Council without royal assent.  - Natural law (\\"lex naturalis\\") is a philosophy that certain rights are inherent by virtue of human nature and can be understood universally through human reason. Historically, natural law refers to the use of reason to analyze human nature to deduce binding rules of moral behavior. The law of nature, as determined by nature, is universal.  - The Exchequer of Pleas or Court of Exchequer was a court that dealt with matters of equity, a set of legal principles based on natural law and common law in England and Wales. Originally part of the \\"curia regis\\", or King's Council, the Exchequer of Pleas split from the \\"curia\\" during the 1190s, to sit as an independent, central court. The Court of Chancery's reputation for tardiness and expense resulted in much of its business transferring to the Exchequer. The Exchequer and Chancery, with similar jurisdictions, drew closer together over the years, until an argument was made during the 19th century that having two seemingly identical courts was unnecessary. As a result, the Exchequer lost its equity jurisdiction. With the Judicature Acts, the Exchequer was formally dissolved as a judicial body by an Order in Council of 16 December 1880.  - The Court of Chancery was a court of equity in England and Wales that followed a set of loose rules to avoid the slow pace of change and possible harshness (or \\"inequity\\") of the common law. The Chancery had jurisdiction over all matters of equity, including trusts, land law, the administration of the estates of lunatics and the guardianship of infants. Its initial role was somewhat different, however; as an extension of the Lord Chancellor's role as Keeper of the King's Conscience, the Court was an administrative body primarily concerned with conscientious law. Thus the Court of Chancery had a far greater remit than the common law courts, whose decisions it had the jurisdiction to overrule for much of its existence, and was far more flexible. Until the 19th century, the Court of Chancery could apply a far wider range of remedies than the common law courts, such as specific performance and injunctions, and also had some power to grant damages in special circumstances. With the shift of the Exchequer of Pleas towards a common law court and loss of its equitable jurisdiction by the Administration of Justice Act 1841, the Chancery became the only national equitable body in the English legal system.  - A statute is a formal written enactment of a legislative authority that governs a state, city or country. Typically, statutes command or prohibit something, or declare policy. Statutes are rules made by legislative bodies; they are distinguished from case law or precedent, which is decided by courts, and regulations issued by government agencies. Statute law is written by a government's legislative body and signed into law by its executive.  - A judge presides over court proceedings, either alone or as a part of a panel of judges. The powers, functions, method of appointment, discipline, and training of judges vary widely across different jurisdictions. The judge is supposed to conduct the trial impartially and in an open court. The judge hears all the witnesses and any other evidence presented by the barristers of the case, assesses the credibility and arguments of the parties, and then issues a ruling on the matter at hand based on his or her interpretation of the law and his or her own personal judgment. In some jurisdictions, the judge's powers may be shared with a jury. In inquisitorial systems of criminal investigation, a judge might also be an examining magistrate.  - Her Majestys Exchequer or just the Exchequer is a term used in the civil service of the United Kingdom for the accounting process of central government and for the government's \\"current account\\" i.e. money held from taxation and other government revenues in the Consolidated Fund It can be found used in various financial documents including the latest departmental and agency annual accounts.  - The English Civil War (16421651) was a series of armed conflicts and political machinations between Parliamentarians (\\"Roundheads\\") and Royalists (\\"Cavaliers\\") over, principally, the manner of England's government. The first (164246) and second (164849) wars pitted the supporters of King Charles I against the supporters of the Long Parliament, while the third (164951) saw fighting between supporters of King Charles II and supporters of the Rump Parliament. The war ended with the Parliamentarian victory at the Battle of Worcester on 3 September 1651.  - A Court of Common Pleas is a common kind of court structure found in various common law jurisdictions. The form originated with the Court of Common Pleas in England, which was created to permit individual to press civil grievances against one another without involving the King.  - Accounting or accountancy is the measurement, processing and communication of financial information about economic entities such as businesses and corporations. The modern field was established by the Italian mathematician Luca Pacioli in 1494. Accounting, which has been called the \\"language of business\\", measures the results of an organization's economic activities and conveys this information to a variety of users, including investors, creditors, management, and regulators. Practitioners of accounting are known as accountants. The terms \\"accounting\\" and \\"financial reporting\\" are often used as synonyms.  - Curia regis is a Latin term meaning \\"royal council\\" or \\"king's court.\\" It was the name given to councils of advisors and administrators who served early French kings as well as to those serving Norman and later kings of England.  - The Court of Common Pleas , or Common Bench , was a common law court in the English legal system that covered \`\` common pleas '' ; actions between subject and subject , which did not concern the king . Created in the late 12th to early 13th century after splitting from the Exchequer of Pleas , the Common Pleas served as one of the central English courts for around 600 years . Authorised by the Magna Carta to sit in a fixed location , the Common Pleas sat in Westminster Hall for its entire existence , joined by the Exchequer of Pleas and Court of King 's Bench . The court 's jurisdiction was gradually undercut by the King 's Bench and Exchequer of Pleas with legal fictions , the Bill of Middlesex and Writ of Quominus respectively . The Common Pleas maintained its exclusive jurisdiction over matters of real property until its dissolution , and due to its wide remit was considered by Sir Edward Coke to be the \`\` lock and key of the common law '' . It was staffed by one Chief Justice and a varying number of puisne justices , who were required to be Serjeants - at - Law , and until the mid 19th century only Serjeants were allowed to plead there . As one of the two principal common law courts with the King 's Bench , the Common Pleas fought to maintain its jurisdiction and caseload , in a way that during the 16th and 17th centuries was categorised as conservative and reactionary . Reaching an acceptable medium with the King 's Bench and Exchequer of Pleas proved to be the downfall of all three courts ; with several courts of near - identical jurisdiction , there was little need for separate bodies , and the superior courts of Westminster were merged by the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873 into a single High Court of Justice . With an Order in Council issued on 16 December 1880 , the Common Pleas Division of the High Court ceased to exist , marking the end of the Court of Common Pleas .  - A tribunal, generally, is any person or institution with authority to judge, adjudicate on, or determine claims or disputeswhether or not it is called a tribunal in its title. For example, an advocate who appears before a court with a single judge could describe that judge as 'their tribunal'. Many governmental bodies that are titled 'tribunals' are so described to emphasize that they are not courts of normal jurisdiction. For example, the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda is a body specially constituted under international law; in Great Britain, employment tribunals are bodies set up to hear specific employment disputes. Private judicial bodies are also often styled 'tribunals'. The word \\"tribunal\\" is not conclusive of a body's function. For example, in Great Britain, the Employment Appeal Tribunal is a superior court of record.  - The Thirteen Colonies were a group of British colonies on the east coast of North America founded in the 17th and 18th centuries that declared independence in 1776 and formed the United States. The thirteen were: Delaware, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Georgia, Connecticut, Massachusetts Bay, Maryland, South Carolina, New Hampshire, Virginia, New York, North Carolina, and Rhode Island and Providence Plantations.  - The Judicature Acts are a series of Acts of Parliament, beginning in the 1870s, which aimed to fuse the hitherto split system of courts in England and Wales. The first two Acts were the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1873 (36 & 37 Vict c. 66) and the Supreme Court of Judicature Act 1875 (38 & 39 Vict c. 77), with a further series of amending acts (12 in all by 1899).  - Sir Edward Coke ((\\"cook\\"), formerly ; 1 February 1552  3 September 1634) was an English barrister, judge and, later, opposition politician, who is considered to be the greatest jurist of the Elizabethan and Jacobean eras. Born into a middle-class family, Coke was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge, before leaving to study at the Inner Temple, where he was called to the Bar on 20 April 1578. As a barrister he took part in several notable cases, including \\"Slade's Case\\", before earning enough political favour to be elected to Parliament, where he served first as Solicitor General and then as Speaker of the House of Commons. Following a promotion to Attorney General he led the prosecution in several notable cases, including those against Robert Devereux, Sir Walter Raleigh, and the Gunpowder Plot conspirators. As a reward for his services he was first knighted and then made Chief Justice of the Common Pleas.  - The Anglo-Saxons are a people who have inhabited Great Britain from the 5th century. They comprise people from Germanic tribes who migrated to the island from continental Europe, their descendants, and indigenous British groups who adopted some aspects of Anglo-Saxon culture and language. Historically, the Anglo-Saxon period denotes the period in Britain between about 450 and 1066, after their initial settlement and up until the Norman conquest.  - In legal systems based on common law, a precedent, or authority, is a principle or rule established in a previous legal case that is either binding on or persuasive for a court or other tribunal when deciding subsequent cases with similar issues or facts . Common law legal systems place great value on deciding cases according to consistent principled rules so that similar facts will yield similar and predictable outcomes, and observance of precedent is the mechanism by which that goal is attained. The principle by which judges are bound to precedents is known as stare decisis. Black's Law Dictionary defines \\"precedent\\" as a \\"rule of law established for the first time by a court for a particular type of case and thereafter referred to in deciding similar cases.\\" Common law precedent is a third kind of law, on equal footing with statutory law (statutes and codes enacted by legislative bodies), and Delegated legislation (in U.K. parlance) or regulatory law (in U.S. parlance) (regulations promulgated by executive branch agencies).  - A consolidated fund or the consolidated revenue fund is a term used in many countries with political systems derived from the Westminster system to describe the main bank account of the government.   - England and Wales is a legal jurisdiction covering England and Wales, two of the four countries of the United Kingdom, which form the constitutional successor to the former Kingdom of England and follow a single legal system, known as English law.  - The charter became part of English political life and was typically renewed by each monarch in turn, although as time went by and the fledgling English Parliament passed new laws, it lost some of its practical significance. At the end of the 16th century there was an upsurge in interest in Magna Carta. Lawyers and historians at the time believed that there was an ancient English constitution, going back to the days of the Anglo-Saxons, that protected individual English freedoms. They argued that the Norman invasion of 1066 had overthrown these rights, and that Magna Carta had been a popular attempt to restore them, making the charter an essential foundation for the contemporary powers of Parliament and legal principles such as \\"habeas corpus\\". Although this historical account was badly flawed, jurists such as Sir Edward Coke used Magna Carta extensively in the early 17th century, arguing against the divine right of kings propounded by the Stuart monarchs. Both James I and his son Charles I attempted to suppress the discussion of Magna Carta, until the issue was curtailed by the English Civil War of the 1640s and the execution of Charles. The political myth of Magna Carta and its protection of ancient personal liberties persisted after the Glorious Revolution of 1688 until well into the 19th century. It influenced the early American colonists in the Thirteen Colonies and the formation of the American Constitution in 1787, which became the supreme law of the land in the new republic of the United States. Research by Victorian historians showed that the original 1215 charter had concerned the medieval relationship between the monarch and the barons, rather than the rights of ordinary people, but the charter remained a powerful, iconic document, even after almost all of its content was repealed from the statute books in the 19th and 20th centuries.  - The Glorious Revolution, also called the Revolution of 1688, was the overthrow of King James II of England (James VII of Scotland) by a union of English Parliamentarians with the Dutch stadtholder William III of Orange. William's successful invasion of England with a Dutch fleet and army led to his ascension of the English throne as William III of England jointly with his wife Mary II of England, James's daughter, in conjunction with the documentation of the Bill of Rights 1689.  - The divine right of kings, divine right, or God's mandate is a political and religious doctrine of royal and political legitimacy. It asserts that a monarch is subject to no earthly authority, deriving the right to rule directly from the will of God. The king is thus not subject to the will of his people, the aristocracy, or any other estate of the realm. It implies that only God can judge an unjust king and that any attempt to depose, dethrone or restrict his powers runs contrary to the will of God and may constitute a sacrilegious act. It is often expressed in the phrase \\"by the Grace of God\\", attached to the titles of a reigning monarch.  - A court is a tribunal, often as a government institution, with the authority to adjudicate legal disputes between parties and carry out the administration of justice in civil, criminal, and administrative matters in accordance with the rule of law. In both common law and civil law legal systems, courts are the central means for dispute resolution, and it is generally understood that all persons have an ability to bring their claims before a court. Similarly, the rights of those accused of a crime include the right to present a defense before a court.

This comes from the common law tradition which is widely used in many parts of world, particularly in England and countries that were part of the British Empire, including the United States and most Commonwealth countries. The Court of Common Pleas was one of the principal courts in this law system which dealt with \\"common pleas\\" or issues involving individuals. This court evolved in England in the 12th to 13th centuries, having initially been a part of the Exchequer of Pleas. As stated in the information given, the Court of Common Pleas was created to allow individuals to press grievances against each other without involving the king. The creation of this court marked a significant step within the evolution of the common law system as it provided an institution where matters of dispute could be settled based on established laws, regulations, and customs, ultimately contributing to the body of case law that would be referred to in future legal disputes.  The Court of Common Pleas continued to perform a central role in English law for about 600 years, sitting in a fixed location in Westminster Hall and dealing primarily with matters of real property. Its judgments would serve as precedents for other common law courts, hence contributing to the continual evolution of common law. Throughout its existence, the Court of Common Pleas bore witness to numerous changes in the English legal system, including the strengthening of the jurisprudential principle of \\"stare decisis\\" or the doctrine of binding precedent, as well as the growth of case law as a rich source of law. In \\"common law\\" legal systems, the decisions made by the courts - including the Court of Common Pleas - carry weight in future legal decisions due to the principle of \\"stare decisis\\", which means \\"to stand by things decided\\". Through this principle, a form of law known as case law or precedent is developed, providing courts with a point of reference in dealing with cases where similar issues or facts arise. The Court of Common Pleas persisted until the late 19th century when the passage of the Judicature Acts led to the merger of the courts of Westminster into a single High Court of Justice. The Common Pleas Division of the High Court was finally dissolved by an Order in Council issued on 16 December 1880, marking the end of the Court of Common Pleas as an independent entity but its legacy continues within the common law system of England and Wales and wherever else this system of law is upheld. The significant contribution of the Court of Common Pleas to the development of common law ensures its enduring presence in legal history."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The U.S. President and First Lady visited Restaurant Eve, in Alexandria, Virginia - located just seven miles southwest from the White House. The Obama couple married on October 3, 1992, in Chicago, so their actual 19th wedding anniversary is tomorrow. Strong marriage: Barack and Michelle Obama wed on October 3, 1992, in Chicago, and they celebrated in style at a 150-a-head restaurant last night. President Obama had been speaking at an event for a major gay rights organisation on Saturday night before going out to dinner. He returned to the White House briefly after the speech before his motorcade made its way to the upscale restaurant in Virginia. Restaurant Eve’s chef Cathal Armstrong has worked with Mrs Obama to promote healthier eating for children, reported the Washington Times. Mrs Obama said earlier this year that the couple’s secret to long-lasting marriage is laughing and not taking themselves too seriously at home. Mr Armstrong has previously cooked for television chef Julia Child and Senator Ted Kennedy, reported Irish Central. Dinner location: The U.S. President and First Lady visited Restaurant Eve, located in Alexandria, Virginia - just seven miles away from the White House. The restaurant is named after Mr Armstrong’s first child with his wife Meshelle and is located in a converted warehouse from the late 1800s. Restaurant Eve has two ‘dining experiences’. One is the 34-seat ‘Chef's Tasting Room’ with prix-fixe tasting menus costing up to 150. Mr Armstrong's signature dishes include the heirloom tomato tart with garden basil and butter poached Maine lobster with Eastern Shore corn. It also has ‘The Bistro’, featuring main courses priced up to 41 and a prix-fixe three course menu on Friday and Saturday nights for 65. Desserts include the gianduja French toast and apple doughnuts. 'Restaurant Eve' tweeted: 'Love people who have great palates and dine with us... especially uh...

French is a Romance language that belongs to the Indo-European family of languages. It is widely spoken in France, Belgium, Switzerland, Canada, and many parts of Africa, such as in the countries of Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, and many sub-Saharan African states. The French language traces its roots to the Latin spoken in Gaul, which was under Roman rule until the fall of the Western Roman Empire. Over time, the language evolved through various stages, from Old French to Middle French, and finally to the Modern French we know today. French vocabulary has been significantly influenced by Latin, Greek, and Germanic languages, particularly Old Frankish. Moreover, due to French colonial history, many French-speaking countries have inflections and loanwords unique to their regions. Today, French is considered an official language in 29 countries worldwide, making it the second most studied foreign language after English. Additionally, it is an official language of numerous international organizations such as the United Nations, the International Olympic Committee, and the European Union, among others.

EXCLUSIVE: Mom speaks for daughter allegedly raped at school Last fall, a 19-year-old high school senior was taken away in handcuffs and charged with sexually abusing a 15-year-old sophomore inside an empty classroom of a Bronx charter school. This allegedly happened during school hours, with students and teachers just a few doors down. Serious questions have emerged about how the Bronx Preparatory Charter School handled this outrageous incident and its aftermath. The mother of the victim has come forward to the Daily News to allege the school had inadequate security and took several hours to notify police. And the school told her daughter she’d have to return to the school where the incident took place, or reenter a lottery to try for another charter school. BRONX HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER BUSTED TRYING TO SEDUCE UNDERCOVER OFFICER POSING AS 14-YEAR-OLD: COPS The mother, whose name The News is withholding, said the school was more interested in protecting its own reputation than in her daughter’s well-being. “The school wants to look good and my daughter makes them look bad. So they don’t want her,” she said. On the outside, the school — whose motto is “No excuses!” — appears as a picture of success. It sits in a modern building in Claremont. Its officials boast that 100% of its students get into college, and its charter was just renewed by the State University of New York Charter Schools Institute. A closer look, however, reveals a different scenario, starting with the events of Nov. 18. During Period 5, the girl was supposed to meet her math teacher in the empty classroom for tutoring. The teacher never showed. While she was waiting, she says, an older classmate entered the room and raped her on a school desk while classes were in session down the hall. The older student was arrested that day, and when the girl was questioned by prosecutors with the Bronx district attorney’s office, she told them this wasn’t the only incident. NEW JERSEY TEEN BUSTED FOR RAPE OF BRONX STUDENT, 19, IN COLLEGE DORM: COPS According to a complaint filed in court, the victim said she’d been sexually molested previously by this same older student on as many as five occasions in empty classrooms. The girl says all of the incidents took place inside the school, during the school day. The suspect, Kevin Simpson, was arrested and is facing sexual misconduct charges. The girl’s mother says her daughter is traumatized and no longer attends school. The mother questions many aspects of the school’s handling of the incident. For example, it appears there was a significant delay between when a school employee was first told of the occurrence and when police were summoned, the mother says. The girl’s mother says she arrived at the charter shortly after getting a call from the school, and her daughter was in a room being questioned by school officials. She says police did not arrive until several hours later. An NYPD spokesman said there was nothing in its paperwork to indicate when cops were called and when they got there. Her daughter was devastated by the attack, becoming withdrawn, avoiding friends and writing dark poetry about being hurt by her attacker. She did not want to return to the building where she was abused. At first, the girl’s mother said, the school was helpful. ARIZONA STATE STUDENT, 18, KIDNAPPED AND RAPED ON HER WALK HOME FROM A PARTY: COPS Bronx Preparatory Charter School is managed by Democracy Prep, a national outfit that runs 18 charter schools across the country, including four high schools in the city. Democracy Prep quickly found a spot for her daughter at another one of its charter schools, in Harlem. But soon her daughter began failing classes. At the end of the school year, the mother says, Democracy Prep told her that her daughter would have to return to the school where she was assaulted. “They wanted her to go back where this incident took place,” the mother said. She said her daughter told her, “‘Everybody knows. The students know. I don’t want to go back.’” Furious, the mother refused, and since June, the girl has not attended school. “They didn’t give me no help. The ‘help’ . . . is to tell me to take her back? No,” the mom said. The girl’s family retained attorney Mark Segal of Segal & Lax, who filed suit. Democracy Prep spokeswoman Alice Maggin wouldn’t discuss the incident while the suit is pending, but said in general, “Democracy Prep runs 18 different schools. Just because we are the manager of those schools, one cannot move between two charter schools by law.” Maggin wouldn’t answer general questions about security at the school, and declined to reveal the name of the security company hired by the school. NEW STUDY FINDS 1 IN 4 COLLEGE WOMEN VICTIMS OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT But the incident last year wasn’t the only issue involving student discipline at Bronx Prep. The school, which opened in 2000, started strong, but in the past three years has fallen way behind. In April 2014, the school brought in Democracy Prep to take over management. In its most recent report, the school says it serves 750 students in grades 5 through 12. A random state inspection Dec. 2 found teachers had lost control of the class in nine of 18 classrooms visited. In a writing class of 18 students, “four browsed noneducational videos on YouTube, one student was on Facebook and two others monitored social media feeds.” The report stated that “20 minutes into the class period, none of these students had started the writing assignment despite the teacher’s repeated attempts to focus the class on lesson activities.” In the 2013-14 school year preceding the incident, 36 of 67 teachers left the school. In its February report, the state found Bronx Prep “is making progress in converting its student discipline system to the Democracy Prep ‘no excuses’ model.” The school implemented a program called “DREAM Dollars,” awarding points to students who behave. The state found “while the program is not at full fidelity, staff members report fewer large disruptive behaviors.” The school also ended its policy of letting high school students leave the building during lunch. Prospective parents would have a tough time knowing why any of this was going on. That’s because the minutes of board meetings posted online make no reference to the incident or the resultant security changes. Nancy Garvey, the board’s chairwoman until June, declined to discuss why that happened or anything else involving the school. She referred The News to Democracy Prep. Democracy Prep spokeswoman Maggin said, “Anyone who engages in the work of turnaround does so to provide better educational outcomes for students in persistently low-performing schools. It involves changing culture for students, teachers and families and instilling academic discipline and rigor. “Turnaround is exceptionally hard work that requires urgency and sustained effort.” BRONX CLASSMATES IDENTIFY TEEN ACCUSED OF TRYING TO RAPE GIRL: OFFICIALS Meanwhile, the girl’s mother is despondent, worried that her daughter will never return to school and wind up without a high school degree. “My daughter is a different person. She started eating a lot. She’s crying. She can be talking to you one minute and you’d think she was happy-go-lucky, and then she’s just bursting out crying,” the mom said. “She’s just lying in bed, all day. And then she can’t sleep all night. Why is she not sleeping at night? She says she’s having nightmares.” Now her daughter carries a hammer in her purse. “She says I’m just carrying it, nobody will know. Just in case somebody wants to do something they shouldn’t do.” What are the most important parts of this text?","output":"1. The story involves a serious case of alleged rape that took place within a Bronx charter school during school hours, involving a 19-year-old senior and a 15-year-old sophomore. The incident happened when the victim was waiting for her math teacher in an empty classroom. 2. Mother of the alleged victim claims the school had lax security, and they delayed reporting the incident to the police. Furthermore, she accuses the school of trying to preserve its image, rather than focusing on her daughter's welfare. 3. The accused, Kevin Simpson, was arrested and is now facing charges of sexual misconduct. The victim has alleged that there have been five such assaults in the past, all occurred within the school's premises. 4. After the incident, the victim was transferred to another charter school managed by Democracy Prep, the same organization that runs the Bronx Preparatory Charter School. However, due to her worsening academic performance, she was subsequently asked to return to her original school. 5. Disturbed by the incident, the victim has stopped attending school, and, according to her mother, is not in a good emotional state, often appearing withdrawn and writing dark poetry about her trauma. She reportedly now carries a hammer in her purse. 6. A separate issue, though potentially relevant, is the declining discipline and academic standards within the school, with a report showing that teachers in half of the classrooms visited had lost control. 7. The victim's family has retained an attorney and filed a lawsuit. However, the management of Democracy Prep would not discuss the specific incident due to the ongoing court case. 8. Overall, there are serious allegations of safety, security, and handling of victims' welfare within the Bronx Preparatory Charter School."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given a pair of words, deduce the type of relationship between them. The various types of relations are: 'HYPER', 'COORD' and 'RANDOM'. Let's denote the first word by X and the second word by Y. A COORD relationship holds when X and Y belong to the same semantic class. A HYPER relationship applies when X is a specific instance of Y. If niether COORD nor HYPER are applicable then the relationship is RANDOM. X: hat, Y: say","output":"The relationship between the words 'hat' and 'say' is 'RANDOM'.  To elucidate a bit more, these two words do not have a 'HYPER' (hypernym) or 'COORD' (coordinative) relationship. The 'HYPER' relationship applies when one word is a specific instance of the other, for example, 'Robin' and 'Bird'. Here, 'Robin' is a specific instance of 'Bird', hence a 'HYPER' relationship. 'COORD' relationship applies when the two words belong to the same semantic category. For example, words 'hat' and 'cap' have 'COORD' relationship because they both belong to the category of headwear.  However, in the pair 'hat' and 'say', 'hat' is a noun referring to a piece of clothing for the head, while 'say' is a verb that refers to uttering words or expressing an opinion. They belong to different word categories and semantic classes, and one cannot be argued to be a specific instance of the other.

Many glaciers from temperate, alpine and seasonal polar climates store water as ice during the colder seasons and release it later in the form of meltwater as warmer summer temperatures cause the glacier to melt, creating a water source that is especially important for plants, animals and human uses when other sources may be scant.

Article: There was a Bulgarian  boy who was an exchange student in the USA. He lived with an American family. One day, he went to his room in the evening, and did his homework. His host-mom came to him and asked if he would like to go along to the movies. He wanted to go, so he shook his head from side to side, said \\"Yes\\". His host-mom did a couple of steps back, and looked puzzled. She thought that he didn't want to go out because he shook his head from side to side. However, he wanted to go out to the movies. Bulgarians shake their heads from side to side when they mean \\"yes\\". People in other countries shake their heads from side to side when they mean \\"no\\". Gestures can have different meanings according to different cultures. For example, in America, putting your index finger  and your thumb  in a circle is commonly used as an OK sign that means everything is all right. However, in France, that sign is used to express \\"nothing\\" or \\"zero\\", which can have a negative meaning. Generally speaking, gestures are a type of communication that uses a part of our body, and when speaking with people from other cultures, gestures can be important keys or clues to understand them. However, we need to understand that those gestures vary from culture to culture, and it is necessary for us to have an open mind in understanding the different gestures. Question: Why did the Bulgarian boy shake his head from side to side? - He thought it rude of him to go with the family. - He didn't understand what the host-mom said. - He changed his mind after saying \\"Yes.\\" - He wanted to go out to the movies.

Thanks to being one of the lucky winners of two-day passes to the recent Formula Drift event, I got to spend two evenings at the speedway.  It had been a very long time since my last visit; probably 8 years.  During my last visit my awesome physics teacher in high school had us all come to the speedway and learn about acceleration the fun way: through drag racing!  Remember to bring your earplugs if you come for this!  For the Formula Drift event, the speedway was far from reaching capacity.  Plenty of parking was available, as well as seating during the event.  Spectators are able to watch from the fence (and consequently covered in rubber from the drifters!) or sit on the bleachers.  The restrooms were not too packed, and had both soap and paper towels; this can be rare during public events!  There were also several food and drink vendors which, as could be expected, were a bit pricey.  Water was 4, iced tea 8, shaved ice 5, beer 1...yep, somehow beer was the cheapest beverage!  I'm not too involved in motor events, so I can't say that I'll be returning here anytime soon.

Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers:  Matter is anything that occupies space and has mass. The three states of matter are solid, liquid, and gas. A physical change involves the conversion of a substance from one state of matter to another, without changing its chemical composition. Most matter consists of mixtures of pure substances, which can behomogeneous (uniform in composition) or heterogeneous (different regions possess different compositions and properties). Pure substances can be either chemical compounds or elements. Compounds can be broken down into elements by chemical reactions, but elements cannot be separated into simpler substances by chemical means. The properties of substances can be classified as either physical or chemical. Scientists can observe physical properties without changing the composition of the substance, whereas chemical propertiesdescribe the tendency of a substance to undergo chemical changes (chemical reactions) that change its chemical composition. Physical properties can be intensive or extensive. Intensive properties are the same for all samples; do not depend on sample size; and include, for example, color, physical state, and melting and boiling points.

The test states that Talia notices her dog's bone can travel with more speed on the hardwood floor than on the carpet when she slides it with the same level of strength. Step 2: Deduce the relationship between speed and distance. As the speed is higher on the hardwood floor, it implies that there's less friction on that surface compared to the carpet. Step 3: Consider the effect of friction on the bone's travel distance. Lower friction on the hardwood floor allows the bone to continue sliding for a longer distance, without the force of the friction slowing it down as much as it would on the carpet. Step 4: Connect the information from Steps 2 and 3 to determine the answer.

The court's dismissal of this case is expected to further confirm the legitimacy of Obama's citizenship, although some individuals may continue to raise doubts and pursue similar cases.

Understand the problem: Two trains, one moving at 60 km/hr and the other at 90 km/hr in opposite directions, have lengths of 1.9 km and 2.1 km, respectively. 2. Identify the given data: - Train A speed: 60 km/hr - Train A length: 1.9 km - Train B speed: 90 km/hr - Train B length: 2.1 km 3. Convert speeds to a common unit of measurement (meters/second): - Train A speed: (60,000 m/hr) * (1 hr / 3600 s) = 16.67 m/s - Train B speed: (90,000 m/hr) * (1 hr / 3600 s) = 25 m/s 4. Determine the relative speed: Because the trains are moving in opposite directions, the relative speed is the sum of their speeds. - Relative speed = 16.67 m/s + 25 m/s = 41.67 m/s 5. Find the total distance they need to cover to pass each other completely: The combined lengths of the two trains. - Total distance = 1.9 km + 2.1 km = 4 km = 4000 m 6.

The first oligarch to do so is murdered alongside his family by a blue-eyed assassin. Poetics lecturer Perry MacKendrick  and his barrister wife Gail are on a holiday in Morocco to try and salvage their marriage after Perry slept with one of his students. Perry strikes up a friendship with Dima, a hearty and boisterous Russian with an eidetic memory. The two men bond over drinks and tennis before Dima invites both MacKendricks to his daughter's birthday. At the birthday party, Dima gets Perry alone and gives him a USB stick that links corrupt British politicians and businessmen to the Russian mafia. He fears for his life after hearing of his fellow oligarch's fate, and pleads with Perry to turn the USB stick over to MI6 when he returns to London. Perry turns the information over to MI6 agent Hector, the investigator in charge. The information provided by Dima enables Hector and his supervisor Billy to witness a meeting between the Prince and corrupt politician Aubrey Longrigg. Billy refuses to sanction an investigation on a chance meeting. Hector continues regardless and recruits the MacKendricks to help stage a chance encounter with Dima in France. There, Dima provides all the names of his clients and confirms each banker and politician involved has received £5 million each for their endorsement of the new bank, with Longrigg receiving £30 million.

Cherie Blair, the wife of previous Prime Minister Tony Blair, said that she would prepare a packed lunch for her son if school dinners do not improve. So what do students of your age eat for lunch at school? Japan High schools have canteens , which serve everything from noodles to rice, but not burgers and chips. Other children bring food from home such as cold rice balls, meat or fish, pickles  and vegetables. Students take home a menu for the coming month containing notes on nutrition value. Twice a year parents are invited to have a taste of the food. The class with the fewest leftovers  at the end of the month receives a prize. Untied States A typical menu from a US school is made up of a hamburger with fried potatoes or roast chicken, lettuce and pickles, fruit and cookies. School lunches must also provide at least one-third of the daily dietary allowances   of protein, vitamin A, vitamin C, iron, calcium, and calories. Australia Meat pies, sausage rolls and hotdogs are all traditional dishes in Australian school shops. But as the nation pays more attention to children's health, healthier foods have started to find their way onto school menus. Many schools have used a traffic light system. The sale of red-labelled foods, including pastries, chocolate and soft drinks, is served only twice a week. Healthier green-labelled foods such as sushi  , sandwiches, corn and watermelon, however, are available every day. In some schools, students have a choice of up to 89 foods to choose from, including popcorn and rice. South Africa Most of South Africa's schools do not serve meals at all. Classes end at 1:30pm and students get their own lunches. Many students bring food from home, usually sandwiches. Fast food and fried food sell the best among students, which has led to a rise in _ among children.

However, people still hope to have a helping hand around the house. A survey showed that 55% of people were going to use robots at home. Easy things like washing and cleaning are becoming the working _ of robots slowly. Although this dream hasn't been achieved, the idea of finding a helping hand at home for people has been used to improve people's everyday life. In South Korea, the famous company LG is working hard to improve people's everyday life by high technology. Tasks such as answering the telephone, opening the door, and turning on washing machines and air conditioners can be done automatically. At the same time, these services can not only be done inside the home, but also can be done through the Internet, or even by a mobile phone far away.

Make this lower case.","output":"they started as members of the best brass bands and became fulltime virtuoso. It is quite common for musicians to begin their careers as part of brass bands before evolving into full-time virtuosos. The term \\"virtuoso\\" is typically used to describe a highly skilled musician, often one who is an expert on a particular instrument or in a specific style of music. The journey of these musicians can be divided into a few different stages. 1. Early exposure to music: Many musicians are initially attracted to music through the influence of their family members, friends, or even teachers. They may have grown up in a household filled with music or attended a school with a strong music program. These early experiences help to foster a love and appreciation for music that stays with them throughout their lives. 2. Joining a brass band: A common stepping stone for aspiring musicians is joining a brass band. These bands consist primarily of wind and percussion instruments, such as trumpets, trombones, saxophones, and tubas. Brass bands provide a great opportunity for young musicians to learn ensemble playing, develop their technique, and gain a deeper understanding of music theory. 3. Developing technical proficiency: As they spend more time playing in brass bands, these musicians begin to focus on mastering their craft. This may involve attending workshops, taking private lessons, or enrolling in a music conservatory. At this stage, they will work tirelessly to refine their intonation, tone, and technique, all while gaining a deeper understanding of music theory and learning to read sheet music. 4. Building a reputation: As these musicians continue to improve, they may begin to receive invitations to participate in competitions, attend masterclasses, and perform at festivals. These opportunities often act as stepping stones, allowing them to establish themselves within the music community and build a strong reputation. 5. Embracing the role of a virtuoso: Eventually, these musicians may be recognized as virtuosos on their chosen instrument. This designation is a testament to their talent, dedication, and hard work. They may continue to perform as solo artists, form or join small ensembles, or even teach others. Transitioning from brass band members to full-time virtuosos is no easy task. It requires years of dedication, passion, and hard work. These musicians are living proof that with the right guidance and perseverance, anything is possible."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Article: Article Excerpt      Apple Inc. is working with component suppliers in Asia to test several designs for television sets, people familiar with the situation said, suggesting that the company is moving closer to expanding its offerings for the living room.      Executives at some of Apple's suppliers said the company has been testing designs for a large-screen high-definition set.

It is still in the early stage of ... ||||| S      There are all kinds of Apple rumors out there; big ones, small ones, smart ones, dumb ones. God knows we run enough of them ourselves. But there's a genus of the species that we never post, ever, because it's so obviously and insidiously dumb and wrong and bad. And here is, without exaggeration, the very absolute worst example of it I've ever seen.      Ladies and gentlemen, meet your worst Apple rumor of the year, and maybe of all time.      You may have seen the headlines already, here and here and probably most other tech sites you follow. The basic gist:      APPLE'S HDTV TO HAVE 3D TECH THAT WILL CHANGE TELEVISION FOREVER      There is, as you might have noticed the last time you attained even the vaguest state of consciousness, no such thing as an Apple HDTV. There never has been. That headline is like saying Charles Barkley might put up a triple double in the Space Jam rematch. So how did a product that doesn't—and may well never—exist suddenly get features that, if it's even possible, exist even less?      Because this morning, the two worst rumor sources in tech found each other. Analysts met patents, and created a perfect storm of bullshit.      This morning, before the market opened, two Morgan Stanley analysts released a report about \\"iTV,\\" Apple's bold foray into our living rooms. The mythical television set would be worth 13 billion to Apple in the US alone, 39 billion globally, and 68,000 gumdrops in Candyland. That's harmless enough; market projections are at least based on how many TVs people buy currently, and a reasonable guess at how many of those people might buy the Apple version. Sure, why not? But then the trouble starts.      It turns out that not only do Morgan Stanley's analysts have a pretty good idea of how many non-existent iTVs Apple will sell, they're also privy to a swath of non-existent features that'll come with it. Including, as StreetInsider happily passes along, a 3D remote control, a \\"groundbreaking 3D imaging and display system\\" that knows where you are and what you're doing and, presumably, shows Duck Dynasty from the appropriate angle, and the ability to display an athlete's blood pressure during football games because why not, might as well, it's all just make-believe anyway. Tickle Honey Boo Boo from your couch while you're at it.      It's tempting to think that these analysts know something you don't. That they have covert sources slipping juicy leaks into their Honeybaked Ham deliveries. But you know what? They don't. They're guessing, same as anyone else. We don't cover analyst rumors, ever, because analysts don't know anything. To put it another way: if they did, Apple's HDTV would be here already. Years ago.      But what makes this particular rumor so galling is that it's not just the normal analyst projections and assumptions and bloviation. It's not even that it's yet another rumor—after nearly THREE YEARS of unfulfilled rumormongering—about a product that is Not Even a Thing. It's that all of these features that the Morgan Stanley braintrust cites come from patents. Come on, guys. You know better than this.      The problem with taking patents at face value is that patents aren't products and, more importantly, are often never even intended to be. Companies file patents defensively, stockpiling them like warheads for the never-ending infringement wars. They are, in their own way, every bit as Not Even a Thing as iTV itself. That's what every single one of these \\"features\\" is based on.      It gets worse, it gets worse! These aren't even new patents Morgan Stanley dug up from some Cupertino patent bunker. The most recent one was filed in 2008, and most were granted months or years ago. Or not at all, which, even better. Will Apple act on them someday? Maybe. Right after they get to that wearable display, and finish building all those iTunes kiosks.      Look, it's just a harmless rumor, sure. But it's also a lazy rumor, one that every single person involved knows has zero percent chance of becoming true in any reasonable amount of time. Could Apple announce an iTV tomorrow? Sure. Could it somehow put Duck Dynasty on your couch? Of course. But it won't. And no one knows that better than the people telling you it might. ||||| So, how could Apple (AAPL) “revolutionize” the television? How about by providing full three-dimensional projections in your living room? StreetInsider reports that Morgan Stanley analysts Katy Huberty and Jerry Liu have outlined some possibilities for what features an Apple HDTV could deliver based on patents the company has filed over the last several years. The most interesting feature the analysts outlined was a “groundbreaking 3D imaging and display system that optically detects human positions and motions, projects virtual objects onto a display area, and provides audio and visual feedback.”      Other possible features include Siri integration, a 3D remote control application that displays a cursor “by the position and orientation at which it is held,” and a “search engine interface to search content across various libraries such as iTunes, imdb.com, amazon.com, netflix.com, and social networking sites, as well as advertising content.” We obviously have no idea if any of these radical concepts will actually make it onto an Apple TV but it does give us an idea of just how big Apple is thinking when it talks about ushering in a new era of television. ||||| What is a summary?","output":"Apple is reportedly exploring designs for television sets in collaboration with its suppliers in Asia.

In other words, this statement highlights the importance of building and enforcing a regulatory framework for the European Union to ensure proper functioning and cooperation among its member countries. The European Parliament, the Council, and the Commission are the three primary institutions responsible for these tasks. The European Parliament represents European citizens and legislation. Its main roles are to legislate, supervise, and exercise democratic control over the European Union's political activities. The Council, on the other hand, is composed of representatives from each member state's government and represents national interests. It has a crucial role in the European Union's decision-making process, as it is responsible for adopting laws and coordinating policies. Lastly, the Commission acts as the European Union's executive body, implementing legislation and ensuring that all member countries comply with EU laws and rules. President Prodi's statement underscores the need for a comprehensive regulatory framework that takes into account the diverse interests and needs of member countries while fostering cooperation and unity within the European Union. This includes the establishment of laws and guidelines for various sectors, such as economic policy, environmental protection, and social welfare. A proper regulatory framework is indispensable for the smooth functioning of the European Union. It not only enables the efficient and effective management of EU resources but also ensures that the rights and interests of all European citizens are protected. Moreover, this framework promotes integration between member countries, fostering mutual trust, and strengthening the EU's global position. To achieve this, the European institutions must work cohesively and transparently, engaging in regular consultations and dialogues with various stakeholders. In addition, the institutions should adopt a proactive approach to address emerging challenges, such as technological advancements, global crises, and geopolitical shifts. In conclusion, the statement emphasizes the importance of a robust regulatory framework for the European Union, which will only be possible through the close collaboration of the European Parliament, the Council, and the Commission. This framework is vital for maintaining stability, protecting the interests of European citizens, and ensuring the effectiveness and unity of the EU in the face of various global challenges."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: The fight over the US government’s definitions for certain foods has flared up again. It’s no longer just a fight for milk farmers, who’ve grown increasingly angry about plant-based food companies (think soy, almond, and cashews) calling their liquid products “milk.”      For the first time, vegetables are being roped into the debate—all because of the arrival and popularization of “cauliflower rice.”      “Only rice is rice, and calling ‘riced vegetables’ ‘rice,’ is misleading and confusing to consumers,” Betsy Ward, president of industry lobby USA Rice, said in a statement earlier this month. “We may be asking the Food and Drug Administration and other regulatory agencies to look at this.” Ward added that Scott Gottlieb, the new Trump-appointed FDA commissioner, could use his power to enforce the agency’s existing definitions for food, the so-called “standards of identity.”      Reuters/Khaled Abdullah Cauliflower by the truckload.      Only recently did cauliflower rice appear in the freezer section of the grocery store—and in close proximity to frozen rice and vegetable packages, Michael Klein, a spokesman for the rice lobby, told Quartz. Klein adds that one company, Green Giant Fresh, used a “Move over, rice” marketing campaign.      But the cauliflower side isn’t worried. “Using the FDA to combat merchandising efforts? That’s a story they’re telling their retail partners,” said Gina Nucci of the California-based produce company, Mann Packing, which sells cauliflower products. “Every section of the grocery store is fighting for the same food dollar.

I don’t think anyone is going to mistake regular rice for a riced cauliflower product, frozen or fresh.”      She says consumers are on the lookout for rice alternatives because there’s a demand for ready-to-eat products that take less time to prepare than whole-head cauliflower rice.      Still, this isn’t a clean case for the rice lobby, which now finds itself in the unenviable position of appearing to speak out of both sides of its mouth. While the industry group frets over shredded cauliflower, some of its members benefit from relaxed enforcement of standards of identity. Rice milk and yogurt can be found at nearly all major supermarket retailers, including Costco and Whole Foods 365 brand. Yet greater enforcement of the FDA’s standards of identity would likely give those rice products companies trouble.      For its part, the rice lobby says the goal should be to avoid confusing consumers—but it does not want to be the arbiter of deciding whether consumers are confused when they see rice milk on the shelves of the dairy section. (The dairy industry has been vocal about this matter: “Milk is a product that comes from cows,” it contended (pdf) in February.)      “Just as with milk, no one owns the word ‘rice,'” said Michele Simon, executive director of the Plant Based Foods Association. To date, in at least two US lawsuits (one against Whitewave Foods Company in 2013 and the other against Trader Joe’s Company in 2015) judges have dismissed cases in which plaintiffs sought to have companies stop using the word “milk” when marketing soy milk.      “As long as consumers are not confused,” Simon added, “I doubt USA Rice will get very far with FDA.”      The Good Food Institute earlier this year submitted to the government a request that it clarify how foods can be named. “This is what’s so frustrating about this issue,” Joanna Grossman, a lobbyist for the group, told Quartz. ”Everybody wants to pick and choose what should come under greater enforcement and, in my mind, there’s a broader problem. So many of these definitions haven’t caught up with the times. We’re operating in a sphere where some of these definitions are really strange and obscure.”      Take, for instance, tamales. Technically speaking, under the current USDA standards of identity, frozen vegetarian tamales in the supermarket freezer section aren’t tamales. That’s because, under agency rules, 25% of a tamale must be comprised of meat. ||||| Cauliflower rice has been popping up in grocery freezer aisles and on the menu at restaurants nationwide, as an increasing number of health-conscious eaters look to curb their carb intake.      The plant-based imitation food seems to be especially prevalent in Silicon Valley, where tech workers are cutting carbs and eating lots of fat in an attempt to lead longer, better lives.      The rising popularity of the carb-light alternative to rice isn't making the rice industry happy. A rice lobby group said it may ask the US government to review its definition of rice in an effort to lessen the competition in cauliflower, Quartz reported.      Cauliflower rice looks like rice. It's made from pulsing the vegetable briefly in a food processor. Like rice, it soaks up the juices and seasonings of whatever it's cooked with. But on its own, cauliflower rice has the bland taste of cauliflower and the wetness of minced zucchini.      On a recent visit to Mealmade, an on-demand food delivery startup based in San Francisco, I watched one cook chop cauliflower while another pulverized the vegetable in a food processor. Later in the day, they would scoop it into compostable containers for a variety of dishes.      The startup, founded in 2015, specializes in healthy takes on comfort food classics. The Carne Asada Taco Bowl tops cauliflower rice with grass-fed sirloin steak, fried plantains, organic pickled peppers, and guacamole. The Orange Chicken — a best-seller according to Mealmade — buries the cauliflower rice in coconut-flour fried chicken, cilantro, and sliced kumquats.      Cauliflower rice is also on the menus at on-demand food delivery startups Sprig and Thistle, as well as meal-kit delivery services Blue Apron and Sun Basket.      There are about two grams of net carbohydrates in a cup of cauliflower, compared to 51 grams in white rice and 42 grams in brown rice.      The rice industry is not thrilled at the prospect of an imitation food, especially a guilt-free one, taking away their market share. \\"Only rice is rice, and calling 'riced vegetables' (as cauliflower rice is sometimes named) 'rice,' is misleading and confusing to consumers,\\" Betsy Ward, president of USA Rice, said in a statement in May. \\"We may be asking the Food and Drug Administration and other regulatory agencies to look at this.\\"      The FDA has oversight over food labeling and can force a company to change a product name if it is likely to stump customers. For example, Tyson's Any'tizers Boneless Chicken Wyngz* feature an asterisk because the \\"wyngz\\" contain no real wing meat.      Silicon Valley startup Hampton Creek created a line of \\"Just Mayo\\" products made from plants. The FDA issued a letter in 2015 saying the products can't be called mayonnaise because they do not contain eggs. (The FDA later decided only semantic changes on the label were necessary.)      Dairy groups have waged similar battles with makers of soy and almond milk.      Michele Simon, executive director of the Plant Based Foods Association, remains optimistic.      \\"Just as with milk, no one owns the word 'rice,'\\" Simon told Quartz. ||||| Summary:","output":"The rising popularity of cauliflower rice as a healthy, carb-light alternative to traditional rice has sparked controversy among food suppliers in the US, with industry lobby group USA Rice arguing that its labelling is misleading and confusing to customers.

It usually takes 1-3 weeks for the test results to come back, but your doctor should be able to give you a more accurate estimate. Ask them if you can expect them to call you or if the results will be posted in an online chart for you to view.If you don’t hear back within 3 weeks, call your doctor’s office and ask about the results. Most of the time, pap smear test results come back normal. Sometimes, however, you might get a result of “abnormal” or “unclear.” If this happens, don’t worry! Even an abnormal test result doesn’t necessarily mean that anything is seriously wrong. Talk to your doctor about scheduling a follow-up appointment for further tests.  In rare cases, abnormal cells in a pap smear can be a sign of cancer in your cervix or uterus. If your doctor suspects that your test results might indicate a serious problem, they may have you come in for more tests, like a colonoscopy or a biopsy (tissue sample).  Sometimes, your doctor will recommend that you wait 6 months to a year and then have another pap smear done. If the abnormal cells are still there or if they see major changes since your last exam, they might decide to do further testing. How often you need to get a pap smear depends on a lot of things, such as your age, your medical history, and how high your risk is for problems like cervical cancer or sexually transmitted infections. Work with your doctor to figure out the best time for you to come in for your next routine pap smear and pelvic exam.  Most doctors recommend that you get your first pap smear at age 21, and then follow up every 3 years (or more often if there are abnormal results). Once you’re 30, you can reduce the frequency to once every 5 years unless you have an abnormal pap smear. You can stop having pap smears by the time you’re 65 to 70 as long as you’ve had 3 normal tests within the last 10 years.

Here is a premise: \\"Someone in a pink shirt is riding a brown horse in a rodeo.\\" Here is a hypothesis: \\"The outfielder is waiting to catch the flyball for the final out.\\" .Does the premise tell us whether the hypothesis is true?","output":"The premise and the hypothesis are discussing two completely different scenarios and contexts. The premise focuses on an individual wearing a pink shirt while riding a brown horse in a rodeo, whereas the hypothesis talks about an outfielder waiting to catch a flyball for the final out presumably in a baseball game. Since both sentences are describing separate events, there is no direct connection between the premise and the hypothesis that would allow us to determine if the hypothesis is true or false.  To elaborate, the premise is set in the context of a rodeo, which is a competitive equestrian sport that primarily includes events such as riding, roping, and racing. The individual described as wearing a pink shirt might be participating in a specific event within the rodeo like barrel racing or bareback riding. These events require a certain level of athleticism, horsemanship, and skill from both the participant and the horse. Therefore, the main focus of the premise is the performance of the horse and rider in this particular context. On the other hand, the hypothesis is set in the context of a baseball game. The mention of an outfielder indicates the specific position that the person is playing on the field, which is responsible for catching and fielding balls that are hit towards the outfield. The hypothesis also implies that the game might be nearing its end since the outfielder is waiting for the flyball for the final out. Baseball is a sport that requires a strong teamwork strategy, physical skills, and mental alertness. The main focus in this hypothesis is the completion of the baseball game, which is unfolding independently from the rodeo described in the premise. In conclusion, there is no information in the premise to support or refute the hypothesis because they both describe separate events, settings, and subjects without any direct connection between them. To determine the accuracy of the hypothesis, we would require additional premises or information specific to the baseball game being discussed. Similarly, if we want to gain further insight into the rodeo event, we need additional information about the performance of the pink-shirted rider and their brown horse."},{"instruction":"Detailed Instructions: In this task you will be given a list of strings and you need to concatenate them.

Paragraph: Registration fees for Illinois lawyers could jump as much as 49 a year if lawmakers adopt two separate measures to bolster pro-bono services and support for lawyers with drug and alcohol problems. The Illinois Supreme Court is pushing for legislation that would allow it to dedicate money raised through the fee hikes to legal services to the poor. The justices are floating a 42 increase to shore up financing for pro-bono work, as the normal funding mechanism for legal services has fallen short in recent years. Currently, support for non-profit legal aid groups comes from interest generated on the Lawyers' Trust Fund, which pools clients' money that attorneys hold for such matters as escrow funds. But low interest rates and a sagging economy mean there is less money being generated. After hours of discussion, the high court agreed that raising the registration fees would be the best way to address the declining revenues, Chief Justice Moses W. Harrison II said. The judges were reluctant to raise those fees but eventually decided that supporting probono services was important enough \\"and lawyers had a responsibility to contribute\\" to the cause, Harrison said. Last year, the high court raised the base fee for active attorneys to 180 from 140. Lawyers in their first three years of practice or who are inactive pay 90, and retired lawyers pay nothing. Legislation circulated by the high court's lobbyist specifies that the hike would apply to attorneys \\"paying full annual registration fees.\\" In 2001, there were 57,392 active attorneys in Illinois and 74,311 on the full roll, according to the Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission. The hike would raise roughly 2.4 million. Last year, interest on the trust fund totaled 4.5 million, but service and handling fees consumed 538,000 of that amount. This year's returns are projected to be anywhere between 700,000 and 1 million short of that mark, said Ruth Ann Schmitt, the executive director of Lawyers Trust Fund of Illinois. Harrison said the fee hikes are designed only to counter the shortfall in interest income, not add to the total amount available. \\"Our legal services are already stretched to the breaking point,\\" Schmitt said. \\"We have a tough time raising enough money to properly fund services that our clients need.\\" Neither the Illinois State Bar Association nor The Chicago Bar Association has taken a stance on the proposed hikes.  Question: \\"How much are lawyers paying for their registration fees now?\\" Answer: \\"180\\" Based on the paragraph, choose if the answer is correct: Available options: i. no; ii. yes;","output":"Answer: yes The correct answer is yes. In the paragraph, it is mentioned that \\"Last year, the high court raised the base fee for active attorneys to 180 from 140.\\" This indicates that lawyers are currently paying 180 for their registration fees.

At every opportunity, she would let her voice soar and dance along with the ambient sounds of her world. She dreamt of one day becoming a professional singer, standing on the stage as the audience listened to every note she sang and every lyric she penned. However, life as a teenager often proved chaotic, and Terri found her rock in the close relationship she shared with her elder brother Paul. Paul, despite being older, understood Terri's passion and encouraged her every step of the way. Together, they would practice and rehearse for hours, getting lost in the melodies they created. Paul knew his sister had a talent that needed to be appreciated and Terri was grateful for having such a supportive brother. One day, Paul's friend, Simon, invited them to his graduation-day barbecue. Friends and family gathered at the venue to celebrate Simon's accomplishment and the air was filled with laughter and the aroma of sizzling barbecue. Terri tagged along with her brother, as she relished the opportunity to spend more time with him. However, amidst the good vibes, a storm was brewing. Paul did not get along well with Simon's acquaintance, Robin Childers. They had had a falling out over Robin's previous relationship with Jay the previous summer. Robin's reputation as a troublemaker was widespread and Paul did not want Robin's drama-filled life to seep into his or Terri's. He was afraid that Robin could jeopardize Terri's dream. As the evening wore on, tensions escalated between Paul and Robin. Eventually, it culminated into a nasty altercation that caused the celebratory vibe to sour. Concerned for her brother's well-being and her own safety, Terri quietly slipped away from the festivities and retreated to her safe space -her home studio. It was just the two of them in their small abode, their parents away for the weekend, so Terri felt a strange, unnameable sense of unease creeping up on her as she sang alone in the room. Soon, Paul managed to compose himself after the fight and return home. Upon noticing Terri's withdrawal from the event and the somber mood that weighed over her, Paul knew he had to do something drastic to ensure his sister's safety and mental well-being. He placed a call to Simon, asking for help in sensitive yet unresolved situation. And so, Simon decided to fly to Los Angeles with Terri, hoping to take her away from the negative environment and provide her with an opportunity to focus on her dreams. He had connections in the music industry and remembered fondly how Terri had sung at the party earlier, realizing the potential in her voice. Simon believed that by pulling Terri away from the drama and into a city full of dream-chasers, she would have the chance to turn her dreams into reality, surrounded by a supportive network that extended beyond her brother. Paul, understanding that sometimes one has to let go of those closest to them for their growth, grudgingly agreed to let Terri leave with Simon. He trusted Simon to take care of her and swore to visit her in Los Angeles as often as he could. When Terri arrived in Los Angeles, she was immediately overtaken by the swirl of energy that the city carried. She felt the magnetic pull of her dreams and her heart filled with hope. In this city of angels and dreamers, she could feel the love of her brother from miles away, believing in her and supporting her dreams, as she let her voice rise and pierce through the noise. And though they were far apart, they would continue to share a bond that would only grow stronger as Terri pursued her dreams in the city that never slept."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write highlights for this article: Jury selection is set to start Monday in a trial pitting two children of Martin Luther King Jr. against their brother, whom they accuse of mishandling the late civil rights leader's estate. Bernice King and her brother Martin Luther King III say  Dexter King took funds from their father's estate. Bernice King and Martin Luther King III sued their brother Dexter King in July 2008, one month after accusing him of converting \\"substantial funds from the estate's financial account at Bank of America\\" for his own use, according to the lawsuit. Also named as a defendant is the Martin Luther King Jr. estate, which is incorporated. Dexter King is the corporation's president and chief executive, in addition to being the estate's administrator. The three are the only shareholders in the corporation, and the plaintiffs hold at least 20 percent of its outstanding shares. The lawsuit contends Dexter King illegally and fraudulently converted estate funds and should be forced to repay the money and reimburse the plaintiffs' legal costs. The document, which lists five counts, does not say how much he is accused of taking. Dexter King has denied the accusations. The lawsuit reveals a very public fissure in an iconic family that has always professed unity, particularly as questions have swirled around some of their financial dealings. The three are the only surviving children of Martin Luther King Jr., who was assassinated in 1968, and Coretta Scott King, who died in 2006. Their oldest child, Yolanda King, died in 2007. Bernice King administers her mother's estate. In a countersuit, Dexter King has asked a judge to force Bernice King to turn over their mother's personal papers, including love letters central to a now-defunct 1.4 million book deal. Martin Luther King III and Bernice King complained that Dexter King refused to hold shareholders meetings, which they said was another example of his lack of transparency in handling their father's estate. There had been no shareholders' meeting of the corporation since 2004, something that Dexter King blamed on the distraction caused by the deaths of his mother and sister. Judge Ural D. Glanville ordered a meeting, which was held last week. In a hearing held in late September, Glanville, who will preside over the trial in Fulton County Superior Court, also expressed serious concern about governance of the King estate. The judge issued an order saying \\"the court is extremely troubled.\\" He noted that Dexter King, as the majority shareholder, wields significant power in the corporation because he holds 80 percent of its shares. He alone can constitute a quorum for transacting business, the order says. The judge warned all three Kings that any failure to comply with the Georgia Corporation Code could result in the dissolution of the corporation and the appointment of a receiver.","output":"The trial between two of Martin Luther King Jr.'s children and their brother Dexter King is set to begin with jury selection on Monday.

The percentage of Americans who say they don't have health insurance dropped to 13.4 percent in April, according to Gallup. The number of uninsured Americans has been steadily dropping since last fall, the polling company said, when a peak 18 percent of Americans said they did not have health care coverage. Gallup reports that number of Americans without health insurance decreased at a faster pace as the federally mandated deadline to purchase insurance arrived. Gallup reports that percent of Americans without health insurance dropped to 13.4 during the final month Americans could sign up for health care through the federal exchange. The number of uninsured Americans has been steadily dropping since last fall when a peak 18 percent of Americans said they did not have health care coverage. African-Americans saw the most dramatic increase in health care coverage between the close of 2013, when 20.9 percent told Gallup they did not have coverage and April. Then, only 13.8 percent of blacks polled told Gallup they did not have insurance. Hispanics continue to say they do not have health insurance at higher rates than other demographic groups. In April, 33.2 percent told Gallup they were uninsured. The percent of Hispanics and Americans making less than 36,000 a year who did not have coverage dropped by 5.5 percent in April, respectively. Gallup's numbers are consistent with a Health and Human Services report released last Thursday that showed Hispanic enrollment below what it could be and a high rate of enrollment among blacks. More than 8 million Americans have signed up for health care insurance through the state and federal exchanges, the report said. The Obama administration did not say how many people had signed up for health care, but the number surpasses a previous report of 8 million provided by the president two weeks earlier. The original deadline to purchase. healthcare insurance was March 31. The Obama administration has extended. deadlines multiple times to accommodate Americans having problems with. government's Obamacare sign-up site, healthcare.gov, and Americans with. pre-existing conditions moving out of the government's temporary. high-risk pools and into the general insurance marketplace. Gallup. took its survey of 14,700 Americans from April 1 - 30. The new deadline. for average Americans who had already started the sign up process to. get covered was April 15. Some of. the people Gallup polled who did not have insurance the first or second. week of April may have since finished applying for coverage, potentially. bringing the percent of Americans who do not have coverage down. further. Other Americans may be. waiting to get coverage until for the provision of Obamacare that. requires employers to cover full-time employees to kick in at the start. of 2015. 'On the other hand, it is likely that some newly insured Americans will. not pay their premiums and will rejoin the ranks of the uninsured,' Gallup notes. White House press secretary Jay Carney told reporters last week that the White House did not have, 'hard, concrete' numbers on the number of people who had both signed up for Obamacare through the federal health exchange and made their first payment. A report issued last week by House Republicans estimated that one-third of those enrollees have not paid their premiums. The House Energy & Commerce Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations report is based on information provided to the committee by 'all 160 insurance providers in the federally facilitated marketplace.' The White House disputes the Republican report has not provided evidence to the contrary. A House Republican report claims that one-third of Americans who signed up for Obamacare through the federal health exchange have not yet made their first payment on their plans.

By Laurie Whitwell PUBLISHED: 17:50 EST, 15 January 2014 | UPDATED: 17:50 EST, 15 January 2014 West Ham want the Premier League to take firm action against Fulham if it is proved they tapped up Ravel Morrison. The midfielder is at the centre of a row between the clubs after Fulham head coach Rene Meulensteen said he knew that Morrison, 20, wanted to move to Craven Cottage and confirmed that their bid for him had been rejected by West Ham. It is understood that Fulham offered £7.5million for Morrison and midfield partner Mo Diame, which was dismissed by West Ham, who value Morrison alone at £10m.  OPTIONS: - Cottagers claim that Meulensteen broke Premier League rules by going public about the bid and believe he may have strayed further by saying Morrison wanted to move. - Craven Cottage claim that Meulensteen broke Premier League rules by going public about the bid and believe he may have strayed further by saying Morrison wanted to move. - Diame claim that Meulensteen broke Premier League rules by going public about the bid and believe he may have strayed further by saying Morrison wanted to move. - England U21 claim that Meulensteen broke Premier League rules by going public about the bid and believe he may have strayed further by saying Morrison wanted to move. - Fulham claim that Meulensteen broke Premier League rules by going public about the bid and believe he may have strayed further by saying Morrison wanted to move. - Hammers claim that Meulensteen broke Premier League rules by going public about the bid and believe he may have strayed further by saying Morrison wanted to move. - Laurie Whitwell claim that Meulensteen broke Premier League rules by going public about the bid and believe he may have strayed further by saying Morrison wanted to move. - Man United claim that Meulensteen broke Premier League rules by going public about the bid and believe he may have strayed further by saying Morrison wanted to move. - Meulensteen claim that Meulensteen broke Premier League rules by going public about the bid and believe he may have strayed further by saying Morrison wanted to move. - Mo Diame claim that Meulensteen broke Premier League rules by going public about the bid and believe he may have strayed further by saying Morrison wanted to move. - Morrison claim that Meulensteen broke Premier League rules by going public about the bid and believe he may have strayed further by saying Morrison wanted to move. - Premier League claim that Meulensteen broke Premier League rules by going public about the bid and believe he may have strayed further by saying Morrison wanted to move. - Ravel Morrison claim that Meulensteen broke Premier League rules by going public about the bid and believe he may have strayed further by saying Morrison wanted to move. - Rene Meulensteen claim that Meulensteen broke Premier League rules by going public about the bid and believe he may have strayed further by saying Morrison wanted to move. - West Ham claim that Meulensteen broke Premier League rules by going public about the bid and believe he may have strayed further by saying Morrison wanted to move.","output":"West Ham claim that Meulensteen broke Premier League rules by going public about the bid and believe he may have strayed further by saying Morrison wanted to move. In response to the accusations, the Premier League is expected to launch an investigation into the matter to determine if Fulham and Rene Meulensteen indeed violated league rules regarding tapping up a player and making the bid public. Should they be found guilty, Fulham could face sanctions, including potential fines and other punitive measures, designed to deter any club from engaging in similar actions in the future. West Ham's determination to protect their interests in Ravel Morrison is seen as a clear indication of the club's regard for the talented 20-year-old midfielder. They believe that Morrison is a crucial asset to the team, both in the present and moving forward. With a valuation of £10 million for Morrison alone, West Ham has demonstrated their unwillingness to part with the player for anything less than their asking price. Fulham, on the other hand, will likely defend their actions and dispute West Ham's claims of wrongdoing. They may argue that they made a legitimate bid for the players and that any potential discussions regarding the transfer with Morrison were within legal boundaries. Furthermore, they could emphasize that Meulensteen's public comments were not intended to unsettle the player but merely to express Fulham's interest in signing Morrison. In the meantime, Ravel Morrison may find himself in an uncomfortable position, caught between two clubs in a bitter dispute. While West Ham fights to protect their asset and uphold league rules, Fulham may continue to pursue the player in the hopes of bolstering their squad. Ultimately, the outcome of the Premier League's investigation will have a significant impact on the player's future, as well as the relationship between the two clubs."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He works at the struggling New Deal used car lot owned by the elderly Luke Fuchs, who agrees to help invest 10,000 in Rudy's campaign if he promises to keep the business alive. Meanwhile, across the street, Luke's younger brother Roy L. Fuchs (also played by Warden) is desperate to keep his used car lot from being demolished and replaced by a proposed freeway exit. Wanting to collect life insurance money and New Deal from Luke, Roy hires his mechanic, ex-demolition derby driver Mickey, to recklessly drive Luke's 1957 Chevrolet Two-Ten coupe around the block with Luke in the passenger's seat. After the Chevy crashes back into the lot, Luke dies of a heart attack, but leaves Rudy with evidence that Roy staged the \\"accident\\". In an attempt to prevent Roy from gaining any inheritance, Rudy has his superstitious co-worker Jeff and mechanic Jim help him bury Luke in the lot's backyard in an Edsel that was once New Deal's sign ornament. They explain to Roy that Luke went on a vacation to Miami. The next night, Rudy and his friends make an illegal live broadcast of their commercial in the middle of a football game, but it goes awry when Jeff finds out the car on display is red (which he believes is bad luck) and female model Margaret has her dress stuck on the hood ornament, which rips and exposes her when the hood is popped open. The commercial results in New Deal receiving a massive number of customers the next day. In one deal, Jeff cons a family into buying a station wagon by having the lot's mascot dog Toby fake being run over during a test drive. When Roy lures customers in his lot by hiring a circus animal service, Rudy counters with a live stripper show. Luke's estranged daughter Barbara Jane visits the lot in hopes of reuniting with him after more than ten years, but Rudy conceals the truth about her father by taking her out on a date, which inadvertently convinces her to stay in town.

THIS HOUSE BELIEVES that countries which suffer from natural disasters should receive debt relief What argument could one make about this debate topic?","output":"In this debate, the proposition that countries suffering from natural disasters should receive debt relief has many potential arguments that can be made. For the purposes of providing a detailed and long answer, we will focus on the following key points: humanitarian grounds for debt relief, economic rebuilding and sustainable development, global political and moral obligations, and long-term improvements for disaster preparedness and resilience. 1. Humanitarian Grounds for Debt Relief: The most immediate reason to argue in favor of debt relief for disaster-stricken nations is on humanitarian grounds. Natural disasters like hurricanes, earthquakes, and floods often result in massive displacement, destruction of infrastructure, and loss of life. By providing debt relief, the international community would be essentially providing much-needed funding for rescue, relief, and rehabilitation efforts. Rather than diverting funds to pay off debt, affected countries could direct resources towards addressing the significant challenges faced by their citizens, including access to clean water, food, shelter, and healthcare. 2. Economic Rebuilding and Sustainable Development: Natural disasters can be a significant setback for the economic development of a country. The destruction of infrastructure, loss of agricultural lands, and disruptions in businesses can hinder economic progress, leading to a decline in GDP, increased poverty, and reduced investor confidence. Debt relief would help free up the necessary funds for affected countries to not only rebuild their economies but also invest in sustainable development projects that could make them more resilient to future disasters. For example, investments in renewable energy, disaster-resilient infrastructure, and early warning systems could reduce the impact of future natural disasters, benefiting both the country and the global community. 3. Global Political and Moral Obligations: Supporters of debt relief for disaster-stricken nations argue that the global community has a moral obligation to help those nations recover, especially given that the impacts of natural disasters can be intensified due to climate change. As developed nations have historically contributed more greenhouse gas emissions, they bear responsibility for the increased frequency and severity of natural disasters. Providing debt relief is one way the global community can redress the imbalance and fulfill its responsibility to mitigate the negative impacts of climate change on the most vulnerable countries. Moreover, doing so can also promote global solidarity and cooperation. 4. Long-term Improvements for Disaster Preparedness and Resilience: Debt relief can enable affected countries to enhance their capacities to prepare for, respond to, and recover from natural disasters. With additional funds available, countries could implement comprehensive disaster risk reduction programs, strengthen local capacities for emergency response, and undertake the necessary rebuilding and redevelopment with a focus on resilience. As a result, countries receiving debt relief would be in a better position to face future disasters, reducing the likelihood of needing further financial assistance. In conclusion, proponents of debt relief for countries suffering from natural disasters argue that it is not only a compassionate response to the immediate needs of those affected but also an investment in long-term recovery and resilience. By providing debt relief, the international community can foster unity, address its moral and political obligations, and create a safer and more resilient global society for everyone."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Oystein Aarseth (Norwegian: ['oystein 'os@t]; 22 March 1968 - 10 August 1993), better known by his stage name Euronymous, was a Norwegian guitarist. Euronymous was a founder of and central figure in the early Norwegian black metal scene. He was a co-founder of the Norwegian black metal band Mayhem. He was also founder and owner of the extreme metal record label Deathlike Silence Productions and record shop Helvete. Vikernes was arrested on 19 August 1993 in Bergen. Many other members of the scene, including Blackthorn and Faust, were also taken in for questioning. The trial began on 2 May 1994. At the trial it was claimed that he, Blackthorn and another friend had planned the murder. The third person stayed at the apartment in Bergen as an alibi. To make it look like they never left Bergen, he was to rent films, play them in the apartment, and withdraw money from Vikernes' credit card. On 16 May 1994, Vikernes was sentenced to 21 years in prison (Norway's maximum penalty) for the murder of Euronymous, the arson of three churches, the attempted arson of a fourth church, and for the theft and storage of 150 kg of explosives. However, he only confessed to the latter. Two churches were burnt the day he was sentenced, \\"presumably as a statement of symbolic support\\". Blackthorn was sentenced to 8 years in prison for being an accomplice.  At Euronymous' funeral, Hellhammer (Mayhem's then-drummer) and Necrobutcher (Mayhem's former bassist) decided to continue with the band and worked on releasing the De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas album. Before the release, Euronymous' family asked Hellhammer to remove the bass tracks recorded by Vikernes. Hellhammer said: \\"I thought it was appropriate that the murderer and victim were on the same record. I put word out that I was re-recording the bass parts, but I never did\\". The album, which has Euronymous on electric guitar and Vikernes on bass guitar, was finally released in May 1994.  A part of the Norwegian scene considered Vikernes a traitor for murdering Euronymous and turning his back on Satanism in favor of nationalism and Odinism, although Vikernes claims he was never a Satanist and had only used 'Satan' to provoke. They saw Euronymous' death as a significant loss to the scene, and some black metallers \\"have sworn to avenge Aarseth's death\\". A few years after the murder, Ihsahn of Emperor said \\"There's no discipline in the scene anymore, like earlier on around the shop\\". After his death, a new generation of musicians tried to gain credibility by 'hyping-up' Euronymous, although he was also hailed as \\"the King\\" or \\"Godfather of Black Metal\\" by bands that had emerged before this new generation. However, many of Euronymous' friends and bandmates \\"speak of the killing with a tone of indifference\\". Lords of Chaos remarks: \\"what is striking [...] is how little they care about the lives or deaths of one another\\". In the book, Hellhammer, Ihsahn and Samoth claim that Euronymous' death did not affect or at least not shock them. Anders Odden (a friend of Euronymous at the time) said of the murder: \\"It wasn't odd that he ended up getting killed. He thought he could threaten to kill people without it having any consequences\\". He added: \\"I think many people felt relief once he was gone\\". Writer and musician Erlend Erichsen agreed, saying \\"Nobody was there to boss them about. The 'black metal police' were gone\\". What does \\"the latter\\" refer to?","output":"In the given passage, \\"the latter\\" refers to Vikernes' confession to the theft and storage of 150 kg of explosives. When mentioning the charges against Vikernes, the text states, \\"Vikernes was sentenced to 21 years in prison (Norway's maximum penalty) for the murder of Euronymous, the arson of three churches, the attempted arson of a fourth church, and for the theft and storage of 150 kg of explosives. However, he only confessed to the latter.\\" In this context, the latter denotes the last mentioned charge, which is the theft and storage of explosives."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Guitarist and keyboard player Simon Tong later became a member. Beginning with a psychedelic sound with their debut LP 1993's A Storm in Heaven was the band's full-length debut, produced by record producer John Leckie. \\"Blue\\" was released as the lead single and again managed to enter in the UK Top 75 at No. 69 and reached No. 2 in the Indie charts. The album was a critical success, but was only a moderate commercial success, reaching No. 27 in the UK album chart that summer. The second single from the album, \\"Slide Away\\", topped the UK indie rock charts. During this period the band played a number of gigs with Oasis who, at the time, were relatively unknown.. Furthermore, the band supported The Smashing Pumpkins on the European Part of their Siamese Dream Tour in autumn of 1993..  In 1994, the band released the album No Come Down, a compilation of b-sides plus a live version of \\"Gravity Grave\\" performed at Glastonbury Festival in 1993. It was the band's first release under the name \\"The Verve\\", following legal difficulties with the jazz label Verve Records.  The band then played on the travelling US alternative rock festival, Lollapalooza, in the summer of 1994. A new mix of \\"Blue\\" was released in the US to promote the band. The tour became notorious for the events of 11 July - Ashcroft was hospitalised for dehydration after a massive session of drinking, and Salisbury was arrested for destroying a hotel room in Kansas in a drug-fuelled delirium.

Is the sentiment of the following sentence positive or negative? spirited film","output":"The sentiment of the following sentence \\"spirited film\\" can be interpreted as positive for several reasons. It's important to examine the words, context, and possible interpretations in order to provide a detailed and long answer. Firstly, let's break down the sentence into its individual words: 1. \\"spirited\\": This word has several meanings, and in this context, it likely refers to a film that is lively, energetic, or animated. It generally implies enthusiasm, passion, and a strong overall presence, which can be associated with positive emotions and experiences. The word \\"spirited\\" can also suggest a certain level of boldness or courage, as it might be used to describe someone who stands up for their beliefs or fights for a cause. This characteristic is often admired and appreciated, adding to the overall positive sentiment of the sentence. 2. \\"film\\": The term \\"film\\" itself is neutral, as it simply refers to a motion picture or movie. Its connotation depends on the context and the words that surround it. When paired with a positive descriptor like \\"spirited,\\" it amplifies the overall optimistic sentiment. Now, let's consider the possible interpretations of the sentence: 1. If the sentence is an independent statement, it indicates that the speaker or writer is positively describing a film they have watched or heard about. They appreciate the lively, energetic, or animated aspects of the film, which contribute to a positive viewing experience. 2. If the sentence is part of a larger context, for instance in a conversation or a written review, it still conveys a positive sentiment. It suggests that the person is recommending the film or highlighting its positive qualities. In the context of a review, this statement might be followed by more specific observations or examples that support the positive claim. In conclusion, the sentiment of the sentence \\"spirited film\\" is positive, as it alludes to a movie that possesses lively, energetic, or animated qualities that evoke a sense of passion, enthusiasm, and enjoyment for the viewer. This positive sentiment emerges both from the individual words and their combined meaning within different contexts."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Q: Article: Housing Price in China has always aroused heated discussion among property developers and ordinary Chinese. To many property developers and local government officials, housing price in China is still low compared with many developed countries. However, the average housing price in the United States is only 8, 000 yuan per square metre, while in China, it is even higher than that in the United States. \\"This shows that there are some bubbles  in Chinese real estate  market,\\" the International Finance News reported. Although the average price of residential houses in the United States, after changed to RMB, is about 8, 000 yuan per square metre, the houses in the US are not sold in terms of building area, as most Chinese property developers do when they sell their houses. If the US property developers sell their houses according to the building area, then the housing price will be even lower than 8, 000 yuan per square metre. In most big Chinese cities, such as Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen, houses are sold at a price even higher than those in the US. The high housing price in large cities in China proves that Chinese real estate market does have some bubbles. Moreover, Chinese houses cannot be compared with houses in the US in terms of building quality, environment and supporting facilities. Furthermore, it should be noted that American people's average income is several dozen times higher than that of Chinese people. How can the Chinese afford to buy a house which is even more expensive than that sold in the US? At the beginning of 2007, Chinese government issued a set of policies that aimed to benefit the public. Now in order to reduce the high housing prices, the government can regulate the real estate market by raising tax on property industry and controlling the release of loans and lands to property developers. Meanwhile, the government should allow people to build more houses through various fund-raising channels, such as funds collected from buyers or raised by working units. By applying these multiple means, it is expected that the high housing prices can be lowered and Chinese public can really benefit from the economic achievement.

The package averted a shutdown then, but didn't soothe the hard feelings created by the standoff. Plus, add this to the mix:  The tea party can't stand Obamacare. They don't like it, never will. The GOP is almost two parties these days -- call them standard OPTIONS: - Congress and tea party Republicans. - Democrats and tea party Republicans. - GOP and tea party Republicans. - Obamacare and tea party Republicans. - Republicans and tea party Republicans. - U.S. and tea party Republicans. - Uncle Sam and tea party Republicans.","output":"Republicans and tea party Republicans. The reason this is the correct answer is because the story talks about how the GOP (Republicans) is like two different parties, and the tea party is a faction within the Republican party that has strong views against Obamacare.  The other options are incorrect because they do not accurately describe the split within the GOP. Democrats, Obamacare, U.S., and Uncle Sam are not part of the Republican party, so they cannot be the two \\"parties\\" within the GOP mentioned in the story. And \\"Congress\\" includes both Republican and Democratic lawmakers, so it doesn't refer specifically to the split within the Republican party."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I can’t think of anything “funny” I have seen at the zoo exactly although there has to be something…. we used to go to Catskill Game Farm and Bronx Zoo in NY so I am sure there has to have been something notable, if not funny…. At Catskill Game Farm there were Peacocks that walked around free and made startling noises. There were also punk flamingoes there that were amazing to see. Maybe the funniest (not so funny though) thing was in the area where you could feed deer and baby pigs so sometimes they’d all come around at once and mob you? My daughter wanted to feed who she wanted to feed but the deer and the pigs had their own ideas. The deer liked these crackers kind of like rye crisps and the baby pigs went for the bottles of milk or formula. When my daughter tried to pick and choose and just feed one suddenly she would be surrounded by many. I think my husband must have videos of what transpired. One of these days it might be entertaining to view them again.

Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Ever feel like you've been hit on the head after a bad night's sleep? According to scientists, the thought isn't as unbelievable as it seems. A study found going without sleep for just one night causes changes in the brain similar to those that occur after a blow to the head. The researchers said the healthy young men examined in the study showed a sudden increase in the same chemicals which indicate brain damage. Professor Christian Benedict, of Uppsala University, Sweden, explained that the chemicals NSE and S-100B are biomarkers for brain damage, such as concussion . He said, \\"What we found was their levels in the blood rose in the group that went without sleep for a night. This was not to the extent that would happen after a head injury, for instance, but it was still significant. During sleep, the brain cleans poisonous substances off itself.\\" Benedict also said previous studies which linked a lack of sleep with increased risk of Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and multiple sclerosis could applaud his study. The rise of the chemicals in the blood after sleep loss may suggest not getting enough sleep contributes to a loss of brain tissue, he explained. Benedict, whose study is published in the journalSleep, added, \\"In conclusion, the findings of our experiment indicate a good night's sleep may be critical to maintaining brain health.\\" A third of the UK population suffer from sleep-related problems, while the average person now sleeps for only seven hours a night, compared with almost nine a few decades ago.

Answer: The answer to this question is:","output":"The tone of this product review is mixed, leaning towards negative. Explanation: The reviewer begins by acknowledging the positive aspect of the product, stating that it delivers great pictures. This introduction sets a moderately positive tone. However, as the review progresses, it becomes increasingly more negative. The next section of the review mentions that a really good camera should have a good, solid feel in the hand, and they criticize the camera's lightness and plastic construction. The reviewer believes the camera feels disposable and compares it unfavorably to higher-quality materials such as titanium. This transition from positive to negative tone adds emphasis to their dissatisfaction with the body of the camera. The reviewer then states that the camera would be a 5-star product if it had a more solid build and weighed more. This implies that they find the camera's performance and picture-taking abilities to be excellent, but the poor build quality undermines its overall value. The negative tone further solidifies when the reviewer explicitly states they wouldn't recommend the camera to a friend and suggests looking for more solid cameras available in the market. Thus, it becomes clear that the negative aspects of the product outweigh the positive ones in the reviewer's opinion. In conclusion, while the review acknowledges the camera's ability to take great pictures, the overwhelmingly negative focus on the build quality and overall dissatisfaction with the product suggests that the tone of the review is mixed, leaning towards negative."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Jingning She Autonomous County in Lishui is the only She autonomous county in China. What is the answer to this question: What varieties of Chinese do the largest Han subgroup speak?","output":"The largest Han subgroup, which consists of the majority of the population, primarily speaks the Wu varieties of Chinese. The Wu language group is a subdivision of the wider Sino-Tibetan language family and belongs to the Han Chinese languages category. This linguistic classification has its origins in the ancient region of Wu, which now corresponds to present-day areas including Shanghai, southern Jiangsu Province, eastern Zhejiang Province, and the southern part of Anhui Province. The Wu varieties of Chinese are spoken by millions of people, and these dialects exhibit significant diversity in terms of pronunciation, grammar, and vocabulary. Some of the most well-known Wu dialects include Shanghainese, Suzhounese, Wenzhounese, and Ningboese. These dialects are not entirely mutually intelligible with Mandarin, which is the official language of the People's Republic of China, giving the Wu dialects a distinct linguistic identity. As a result, the largest Han subgroup, which mainly speaks the Wu dialects, plays a significant role in shaping the linguistic landscape of China. In addition to the Wu languages, this diverse population of Han Chinese also contributes to the rich tapestry of other regional languages, such as Hakka, Yue (Cantonese), and Min, that are spoken across the country. Moreover, the article mentions that there are around 400,000 members of ethnic minorities within the region, which includes roughly 200,000 She people and about 20,000 Hui Chinese. The Jingning She Autonomous County in Lishui represents the only She autonomous county in the entirety of China.

In 1898 he was appointed first trombonist and répétiteur with the Carl Rosa Opera Company and toured with the Scottish Orchestra. Though a capable rather than a virtuoso player he won the praise of the leading conductor Hans Richter, for whom he played at Covent Garden. His salary was only just enough to live on, and he supplemented it by playing in a popular orchestra called the \\"White Viennese Band\\", conducted by Stanislas Wurm.Holst enjoyed playing for Wurm, and learned much from him about drawing rubato from players.

Balanini pirates, fervent Muslims, disputed the coast of northeastern Borneo (modern Sabah) with the sultanate of Brunei. Sarawak's coast and jungle interior were controlled by the Iban — Sea Dayak pirates and Land Dayak slash-and-burn farmers. (The Dayaks practiced head-hunting, a ritual that was believed to bring spiritual energy to their communities. ) The region was unproductive and without great resources, except for the Sarawak river valley, where the Chinese mined for gold and antimony. Brunei chiefs traded the metals through Americans in Singapore. In 1839, the governor of Singapore sent James Brooke (1803–1868) to promote trade links with the Sultan of Brunei. He had been an audacious cavalry officer in the Anglo-Burmese wars and now exploited the situation for his own benefit. In exchange for helping the regent end a revolt of uppity Malay chiefs, Brooke was made Rajah of Sarawak in 1841, with his capital in Kuching (founded by the Malays just 11 years earlier). He tried to halt the Dayaks' piracy and head-hunting while defending their more \\"morally acceptable\\" customs. His attempts to limit the opium trade met with resistance by the Chinese in Bau, who revolted. His counter-attack with Dayak warriors drove the Chinese out of Bau and across the Sarawak border. Thereafter, Chinese settlement was discouraged and did not achieve the commercial dominance it enjoyed on the peninsula. In 1863, Brooke retired to Britain, handing Sarawak over to his nephew Charles. More reserved and remote but a better administrator and financier than his uncle, Charles Brooke imposed on his men his own austere, efficient style of life. He brought Dayak leaders onto his ruling council but favored the time-honored colonial practice of divide-and-rule by pitting one tribe against another to keep the peace. Northeast Borneo (Sabah) was \\"rented\\" from the Sultan of Brunei by British businessman Alfred Dent. Dent was operating a royal charter for the British North Borneo Company — a charter similar to that of the EIC.

During the Cold War it was adopted by many North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) countries, with the notable exception of the United States. It is one of the most widely used rifles in history, having been used by more than 90 countries.  - The CAL ( Carabine Automatique Légère ) was a Belgian weapon manufactured by Fabrique Nationale . It was the first 5.56 mm rifle produced by the Fabrique Nationale . It resembled the company 's highly successful FN FAL , but was an original design . Unlike the FAL , it was a market failure , although its development led to the reasonably successful FN FNC .  - Fabrique Nationale d'Herstal (French for: National Factory of Herstal)  self identified as FN Herstal and often referred to as Fabrique Nationale or simply FN  is a leading firearms manufacturer located in Herstal, Belgium, and is owned by the holding company Herstal Group which is owned by the regional government of Wallonia. It is currently the largest exporter of military small arms in Europe.  - The Cold War was a state of political and military tension after World War II between powers in the Eastern Bloc (the Soviet Union and its satellite states) and powers in the Western Bloc (the United States, its NATO allies and others). Historians do not fully agree on the dates, but a common timeframe is the period (the second half of the 20th century) between 1947, the year the Truman Doctrine (a U.S. policy pledging to aid nations threatened by Soviet expansionism) was announced, and 1991, the year the Soviet Union collapsed.  - The FN FNC (French: \\"Fabrique Nationale Carabine\\") is a 5.56×45mm NATO assault rifle developed by the Belgian arms manufacturer FN Herstal and introduced in the late 1970s.  - The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO  '), also called the North Atlantic Alliance, is an intergovernmental military alliance based on the North Atlantic Treaty which was signed on 4 April 1949.

Ditto the condominium and cooperative apartment. Swapping houses for vacation purposes is hardly a new phenomenon. Those who operate as intermediaries in such exchanges say that they are constantly growing. This is the time of year when arrangements for the summer months are normally set in motion. Accordingly, Americans across the country who are familiar with the process are deep into an examination of the possibilities. The choices are broad, ranging from city apartments to castles in Spain, cottages in Ireland, and seaside villas in the Canary Islands or the Bahamas. Judy and Francis Furton, retired schoolteac hers from Detroit who now live in Guadalajara, Mexico, are a couple with long experience inhouse swaps. They have been exchanging with h omeowners in the United States and overseas for 20 years, they said b y telephone from Guadalajara, and this year they plan to swap again. They have b een to Britain, Greece, Jamaica, Bermuda, Venezuela and Hawaii and mo re. Their one-story three-bedroom house in Guadalajara comes with ma id and car - ''Mexican charm with American comfort,'' asthe Furtons p ut it in the home exchange directory. ''Your home is safer with people in it,'' says Mr. Furton, ''and think of all the money you are saving.'' The Furtons list their house in a catalogue prepared jointly by the Vacation Exchange Club, whose offices are at 350 Broadway in Manhattan; the Holiday Home Exchange of Milsons Point, Australia, and the Hawaii Home Interchange in Honolulu. These organizations in turn are affiliated with about 20 other exchange organizations in Europe, including Intervac International and The Directory Group. Over the years a number of similar organizations have been formed in this country and disbanded. The Vacation Exchange Club, founded in 1960, charges an annual membership fee of 21. Members get catalogues in February and April listing the properties available for swaps. A member joining this month, for example, would get both catalogues, but his own home would be listed, assuming a listing were wanted, only in the April catalogue. House exchanges are also arranged through listings posted on bulletin boards at schools and churches, and through classified advertisements in newspapers or magazines distributed in the area people want to visit. The enthusiasts see many advantages. Other people's houses can serve as a comfortable base, they say, from which to explore new areas or to visit friends and relatives without burdening them. The traveler saves hotel bills and the expense of constantly eating out. The uninitiated, however, remain uncertain about letting strangers into their homes. They worry about damage to furnishings and whether the house and car will be adequately covered by insurance. They also wonder whether they would find the house as clean when they return as it was when they left it. ''Relax and have a good time,'' was the advice from the Furtons, who said that with proper preparation, the rest will take care of itself. The Vacation Exchange Club catalogue contains about 6,000 listings, about a third of them in the United States. One recent catalogue, for example, included a large home on 10 acres with garden, pool and tennis courts in the Lower Blue Montains of West Sydney, Australia, owned by a medical specialist; an apartment in Hong Kong with a view of Hong Kong Harbor and the Lowloon Mountains of China, owned by a Union Carbide executive; a remote field cottage in County Cork, Ireland, owned by a duke, and a summer cottage on the ocean in Newport, R.I. David Ostroff, founder and president of the club, emphasizes that the home exchange service is not a real estate, rental or travel agency. ''We only publish and distribute this directory,'' he said. ''We cannot be responsible for the homes, the actions of subscribers or the accuracy of the listings,'' he said. ''On the other hand, since 1960 we have received only a handful of complaints from the thousands who have exchanged.'' He said it would be ''dishonest of us to pretend that exchangers face no risks.'' But the actual dangers are not those that beginners usually expect, he said. There are few instances of property damage or theft, he said. The most frequent complaints arise from differences in housekeeping standards. Less frequent but more serious are reports that some exchangers disappoint their correspondents by withdrawing from apparently firm commitments. A trusting, friendly relationship can be built long before the exchange begins, he said. This is done through letters, tape recordings or telephone calls, which are helpful in personalizing the relationship. Mr. Ostroff also advises people to find out whether their vehicle insurance is adequate, and whether any permits are required, when people are also exchanging the use of cars, boats or other recreational vehicles. Exchangers should be covered, as would any other guest in the house or any friend who uses the family car or other property. He is full of additional tips to the novice: Find out what is covered by insurance in the home being visited; if not meeting the guests beforehand, arrange for keys to be collected from and returned to a third party; lock away valuable or fragile ornaments; leave plenty of closet and drawer space for guests. And don't forget to ask friends and neighbors to welcome the guests, guide them and make them feel at home. As Mr. Ostroff sees it, the house itself is the least important part of it. It's a cross-cultural experience, he says, ''different from what you would have if you stayed at the Dusseldorf Hilton.'' One point of ten made by exchangers is that people living in locations fav ored by travelers have an easier time finding an exchange part ner. Thus, people living in and near the New York area are often in a good position to make swaps. After 50 exchange experiences, Judy and Francis Furton are also mines of information on what the well-prepared swapper should know. They advise, first of all, flexibility. As to time, ''be as flexible as your employment and holiday schedule permit.'' As to place, ''decide on dozens of places, not just one.'' They say the swapper should make the house easy for the stranger to live in. Start by preparing a loose-leaf notebook with instructions on using appliances and other equipment. Leave city and area maps. Tell the visitor how to find stores, repair shops, services of all kinds. Recommend restaurants. Leave telephone numbers for services of all types - insurance agent, doctor, dentist, helpful neighbors and baby-sitters. The Furtons said they usually paid the utility bills when exchangers were using their house - except for long-distance telephone calls. They also said that repair bills were usually paid by the owner, but an unexpected major repair is cleared with a telephone call or cable before work is begun. Exchangers agree in advance who will pay for yard care, maid service or cleaning help. The Furtons say their experience with the cleanliness issue is that standards vary. ''The exchange home may not be as clean as you keep your own,'' Mrs. Furton says. ''Even worse, you may have exchanged with a very fussy housekeeper who thinks your home isn't clean.'' If there are complaints, she says, write a letter to the exchange partner expressing the grievance in detail. Then burn it. ''You'll feel much better,'' she said.

Please tell me if those questions are the same. OPT: *no. *yes.","output":"The questions are not the same. The best sniper rifle in WW2: During World War II, there were several sniper rifles used by various countries, but one of the most effective ones was the Soviet Mosin-Nagant 91/30 PU sniper rifle. It earned the reputation of being one of the best sniper rifles at that time due to several reasons: 1. Accuracy: The Mosin-Nagant 91/30 PU was known for its remarkable accuracy, which was essential for a sniper rifle. It used the 7.62x54mmR cartridge, a highly potent and accurate round. 2. Range: The effective range of the Mosin-Nagant 91/30 PU was between 800 and 1,000 meters, allowing Soviet snipers to engage targets at considerable distances. When equipped with a PU scope, it offered a 3.5x magnification, making it easier for snipers to focus on their targets. 3. Reliability: The Mosin-Nagant 91/30 PU sniper rifle was known for its robust design, making it capable of withstanding the harsh conditions encountered on the Eastern Front, including freezing temperatures and mud. 4. Production: The Mosin-Nagant had been in production since the late 19th century, making it widely available during WW2. The Soviets could readily produce and supply these sniper rifles to their troops in substantial numbers. 5. Skilled operators: Soviet snipers, such as Vasily Zaytsev and Lyudmila Pavlichenko, were highly trained and proved the effectiveness of the Mosin-Nagant 91/30 PU in combat, with many of them achieving over 200 confirmed kills. Why some snipers prefer bolt-action rifles: Bolt-action rifles remain popular choices among snipers and marksmen due to several reasons: 1. Accuracy: Bolt-action rifles are known for their excellent accuracy because of the rigid and sturdy design of their lock-up mechanism. This ensures that there is minimal movement of the components during the firing process, ultimately leading to consistent and precise shots. 2. Reliability: Bolt-action rifles have few moving parts, which reduces the chance of mechanical failure. This simplicity also makes them more resistant to dirt, grime, and harsh environmental conditions, ensuring that they remain functional when needed. 3. Recoil management: Bolt-action rifles allow the shooter to have more control over the recoil, as they manually cycle the bolt, enabling better follow-up shots. This is particularly helpful for snipers who need to make rapid, consecutive shots while maintaining accuracy. 4. Noise reduction: Bolt-action rifles often produce less noise than semi-automatic rifles due to the absence of a cycling action during firing. This aspect is critical for maintaining stealth in sniper operations. 5. Ammunition versatility: Bolt-action rifles can be adapted to use various calibers without compromising the weapon's reliability. This makes them suitable for different types of engagements and enables the sniper to choose the appropriate ammo for their particular situation. While both questions pertain to sniper rifles, they address different aspects: the first question seeks to identify the best sniper rifle used during WW2, and the second question asks why snipers might prefer bolt-action rifles in general."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer to the question: Why did Milo leave the band the last time? is inside the article: The film begins with the Descendents' origins in the neighboring communities of Hermosa Beach and Manhattan Beach, California in the late 1970s. Middle school friends Frank Navetta and Dave Nolte start the band in 1977 by writing songs together on guitar. Classmate Bill Stevenson impresses them with his musical talents and becomes their drummer. In 1979 they meet bassist Tony Lombardo in Long Beach and recruit him to the band. Nolte bows out to join his brothers in The Last, and Navetta, Stevenson, and Lombardo record the Descendents' debut single. Stevenson's high school classmate Milo Aukerman joins the band as lead singer, and the new lineup builds a local following through their catchy and melodic songs, energetic live shows, and Aukerman's image as a nerd. They release the Fat EP (1981) and their debut album Milo Goes to College (1982), so named because Aukerman leaves the band to study biology. Stevenson drums in Black Flag for the next few years. In 1985 the Descendents reconvene for a second album, I Don't Want to Grow Up. Navetta has burned all of his equipment and moved to Oregon, and is replaced by Ray Cooper.

Trevor: Yeah, but Cardi B has shown a lot of growth since she started! She really knows how to create catchy hooks and her flow is just great. She's also not afraid to be herself, which I think is a major plus. Jay: True, Cardi B has a unique style and bold personality. However, don't you think Nicki Minaj is more consistent with her work? Her discography is more diverse, and you can't deny her multiple hit songs and features over the years.

Also, her ability to switch up her style from rap to pop and still be successful in both genres is quite impressive. Trevor: Cardi B has also experimented with different genres. Plus, in a shorter amount of time, she achieved a lot of milestones, like her debut album, 'Invasion of Privacy,' which broke records and won a Grammy for Best Rap Album. She's managed to accomplish a lot in just a few years. Jay: That's true, and Cardi B's impact on the industry is undeniable.

Using the guidelines, we can conclude that Statement 2 entails Statement 1. So, the output should be 'entails'."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the last name of the person who was able to secure occasional commissions to compose theatrical works for the Gonzaga court?, using the article: (English: \\"The Marriage of Thetis\\") After Duke Vincenzo's death in February 1612, Monteverdi found himself out of favour at the Mantuan court. Vincenzo's successor Francesco had no high regard for Monteverdi, and dismissed him from his post. Upon Francesco's sudden death in December 1612, the dukedom passed to his brother Ferdinando, but Monteverdi was not recalled to the court and was appointed maestro di capella in August 1613 at St Mark's, Venice. However, he remained in contact with Striggio and other highly placed Gonzaga courtiers, through whom he was able to secure occasional commissions to compose theatrical works for the Gonzaga court. Thus, late in 1616, Striggio asked him to set to music Scipione Agnelli's libretto Le nozze di Tetide, as part of the celebrations for Duke Ferdinando's forthcoming marriage to Catherine de' Medici. This story, based on the wedding of the mythical Greek hero Peleus to the sea-goddess Thetis, had previously been offered to the Mantuan court by Peri, whose setting of a libretto by Francesco Cini had been rejected in 1608 in favour of L'Arianna.Initially, Monteverdi had little enthusiasm for Le nozze di Tetide, and sought ways of avoiding or delaying work on it. He would accept the commission, he informed Striggio on 9 December 1616, because it was the wish of the duke, his feudal lord. However, the verses he was given were not, he felt, conducive to beautiful music. He found the tale difficult to understand, and did not think he could be inspired by it. In any event he was occupied for most of December in writing a Christmas Eve mass for St Mark's. On 29 December, perhaps hoping that the commission would be withdrawn, Monteverdi told Striggio that he was ready to begin work on Le Nozze di Tetide \\"if you tell me to do so\\". In January 1617, however, he became more enthusiastic on learning that the project had been scaled down and was now being projected as a series of intermedi. He informed Striggio that what he had first considered a rather monotonous piece he now thought..., what would be the answer ? A:","output":"The last name of the person who was able to secure occasional commissions to compose theatrical works for the Gonzaga court is Monteverdi. Claudio Monteverdi maintained contact with Striggio and other Gonzaga courtiers, which allowed him to receive these commissions, such as the composition of Le nozze di Tetide for the celebration of Duke Ferdinando's upcoming marriage to Catherine de' Medici."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Is this review positive or negative?","output":"This review is positive.  The user specifically mentions that the food is \\"delicious,\\" expressing overall satisfaction with the taste and quality. In addition, they point out two specific items from the menu, which are the Wilson burger and the pulled pork sandwich, labeling them as their \\"favorites\\". This further strengthens the positive nature of the review as it shows that the user not only enjoyed the overall food experience but also had signature items they particularly loved.  Furthermore, word choices like 'favorites' and 'delicious' connote a strong sense of approval and satisfaction, which are indicative of a positive review. The reviewer does not mention any negative elements such as bad service, high prices, low quality, or unpalatable dishes, which typically feature in negative reviews.  Although without more context or further elaboration, and recognizing that reviews can be very subjective, it remains safe to assume that this is a positive review. The customer’s choices of words showed positivity, and they are promoting two of the products thereby recommending them to others.  Finally, in judging customer reviews, it's also essential to remember that tone, context, and relative comparison to other products or experiences can also affect the analysis. However, based on the information given, it can be decided confidently that the review about the Wilson burger and the pulled pork sandwich is indeed positive."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

I attended a boarding school for badly behaved children and it had its fair share of bullies who had been expelled from mainstream schools. But this particular bully had even the teachers running scared. When he went off on one, it could take up to four teachers or members of care staff to get him under control. On my first night at boarding school, he stamped on someone’s face and left them permanently disfigured. I never saw anything that bad again but it stayed with me and I could never sleep properly in that school again. On another occasion, it blew up and there were several members of staff restraining him when he farted. To see the teachers all moaning and groaning and huffing and puffing whilst trying to hold him down was hilarious, literally tears in their eyes. He was unpredictable and he didn’t care. I once saw him swing a hammer at another pupil and throw snooker balls at another, and he used to punch as if he was throwing something, so it would result in a painful blow. Eventually, the staff couldn’t cope with him as they were just as scared as we were. He was removed from the school and placed in a secure unit. The night he left, several of us cried with relief. Last year, I was reading an article in a newspaper when a name caught my eye. It seems he became a hopeless heroin addict at some point and had died in his flat on an overdose of prescription drugs and smack. I felt sad when I read it but I couldn’t work out why. Maybe it was because my brother died in the same manner? He was certainly a character, an absolute nutter and ruthless bully who had everyone fearing him.

Chris Vrenna and James Woolley performed drums and keyboards respectively, Robin Finck replaced Richard Patrick on guitar and bassist Danny Lohner was added to the line-up. The stage set-up consisted of dirty curtains which would be pulled down for visuals shown during songs such as \\"Hurt\\". The back of the stage was littered with darker and standing lights, along with very little actual ones. The tour debuted the band's grungy and messy image in which they would come out in ragged clothes slathered in corn starch. The concerts were violent and chaotic, with band members often injuring themselves. They would frequently destroy their instruments at the end of concerts, attack each other, and stage-dive into the crowd.The tour included a set at Woodstock '94 broadcast on Pay-per-view and seen in as many as 24 million homes. The band being covered in mud was a result of pre-concert backstage play, contrary to the belief that it was an attention-grabbing ploy, thus making it difficult for Reznor to navigate the stage: Reznor pushed Lohner into the mud pit as the concert began and saw mud from his hair going into his eyes while performing.

Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: Where was the man who's musical career was interrupted in 1896 principal conductor in 1907? from the following article ?  Monteux's first high-profile conducting experience came in 1895, when he was barely 20 years old. He was a member of the orchestra engaged for a performance of Saint-Saëns's oratorio La lyre et la harpe, to be conducted by the composer. At the last minute Saint-Saëns judged the player engaged for the important and difficult organ part to be inadequate and, as a celebrated virtuoso organist, decided to play it himself. He asked the orchestra if any of them could take over as conductor; there was a chorus of \\"Oui – Monteux!\\". With great trepidation, Monteux conducted the orchestra and soloists including the composer, sight-reading the score, and was judged a success.Monteux's musical career was interrupted in 1896, when he was called up for military service. As a graduate of the Conservatoire, one of France's grandes écoles, he was required to serve only ten months rather than the three years generally required. He later described himself as \\"the most pitifully inadequate soldier that the 132nd Infantry had ever seen\\". He had inherited from his mother not only her musical talent but her short and portly build and was physically unsuited to soldiering.Returning to Paris after discharge, Monteux resumed his career as a violist. Hans Richter invited him to lead the violas in the Bayreuth Festival orchestra, but Monteux could not afford to leave his regular work in Paris. In December 1900 Monteux played the solo viola part in Berlioz's Harold in Italy, rarely heard in Paris at the time, with the Colonne Orchestra conducted by Felix Mottl. In 1902 he secured a junior conducting post at the Dieppe casino, a seasonal appointment for the summer months which brought him into contact with leading musicians from the Paris orchestras and well-known soloists on vacation.

Movie title: The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance Movie plot: Senator Ransom \\"Ranse\\" Stoddard (James Stewart) and his wife Hallie (Vera Miles) arrive by train in the frontier town of Shinbone, in an unnamed western state, to attend the funeral of Tom Doniphon (John Wayne). As they make their way toward the undertaker's establishment to pay their respects to the deceased, a reporter (Joseph Hoover) and his editor, Maxwell Scott (Carleton Young) approach and ask Stoddard to explain why a United States Senator would make the long journey from Washington just to attend the funeral of a local rancher. Stoddard's story flashes back 25 years to his arrival in Shinbone as a young, idealistic attorney. His stagecoach is robbed by a gang of outlaws led by Liberty Valance (Lee Marvin). When Stoddard takes Valance to task for robbing a widow of her heirloom, he is brutally whipped and left for dead. When Doniphon finds and brings him into town, restaurant owner Peter Ericson (John Qualen), his wife Nora (Jeanette Nolan), and employee Hallie tend to his injuries, and explain that Shinbone's townsfolk are regularly victimized by Valance. Link Appleyard (Andy Devine), the town marshal, has neither the courage nor the gunfighting skills to challenge Valance; Doniphon (who loves Hallie and plans to ask her to marry him) is the only man willing to stand up to him.

Force, Doniphon explains, is the only thing Valance understands; he advises Stoddard to either flee the territory or buy a gun. Stoddard maintains he will do neither; he is an advocate for justice under the law, not brute force. He earns the town's respect by refusing to knuckle under to Valance, and by founding a school to teach reading and writing to illiterate townspeopleâincluding Hallie.

Universal Time (UT) is the modern term for the international telescope-based system, adopted to replace \\"Greenwich Mean Time\\" in 1928 by the International Astronomical Union. Observations at the Greenwich Observatory itself ceased in 1954, though the location is still used as the basis for the coordinate system. Because the rotational period of Earth is not perfectly constant, the duration of a second would vary if calibrated to a telescope-based standard like GMT or UT—in which a second was defined as a fraction of a day or year.

(CBS SF)      SAN FRANCISCO (KCBS) — KCBS has learned that Saint Mary’s Cathedral, the principal church of the Archdiocese of San Francisco, has installed a watering system to keep the homeless from sleeping in the cathedral’s doorways.      UPDATE: Archdiocese Apologizes, Will Remove Anti-Homeless Sprinkler System      The cathedral, at Geary and Gough, is the home church of the Archbishop. There are four tall side doors, with sheltered alcoves, that attract homeless people at night.      “They actually have signs in there that say, ‘No Trespassing,’” said a homeless man named Robert.      But there are no signs warning the homeless about what happens in these doorways, at various times, all through the night. Water pours from a hole in the ceiling, about 30 feet above, drenching the alcove and anyone in it.      The shower ran for about 75 seconds, every 30 to 60 minutes while we were there, starting before sunset, simultaneously in all four doorways. KCBS witnessed it soak homeless people, and their belongings.            “We’re going to be wet there all night, so hypothermia, cold, all that other stuff could set in. Keeping the church clean, but it could make people sick,” Robert said.      The water doesn’t really clean the area. There are syringes, cigarette butts, soggy clothing and cardboard. There is no drainage system. The water pools on the steps and sidewalks.      A neighbor who witnessed the drenching told KCBS, “I was just shocked, one because it’s inhumane to treat people that way. The second thing is that we are in this terrible drought.      READ MORE: SF Spends 3 Million Cleaning Up After Homeless      Jennifer Friedenbach, executive director of the Coalition on Homeless said, “It’s very shocking, and very inhumane. There’s not really another way to describe it. Certainly not formed on the basis of Catholic teachings.”      A cathedral staff member confirmed to KCBS the system was installed, perhaps a year ago, to deter the homeless from sleeping there.      Chris Lyford, a spokesman for the Archdiocese, said cathedral staff tries hard to help these people.      “We refer them, mostly to Catholic Charities, for example for housing,” Lyford said. “To Saint Anthony’s soup kitchen for food, if they want food on that day. Saint Vincent de Paul if they need clothes.”      But he says they keep coming back, and most seem to have serious substance abuse issues.      “We do the best we can, and supporting the dignity of each person. But there is only so much you can do.”            Some of the homeless bring waterproof gear, even an umbrella, to try to stay dry. Frustrated cathedral employees tell us they don’t have the staff to police the doorways, which are used by churchgoers during services.      Lyford, who says he didn’t know about the water system until we showed it to him, admits it doesn’t seem to be an effective deterrent.      READ RELATED: Catholic Students Blast Morality Code For Teachers      Then, suggests this church neighbor, turn it off. “I would hope that they would stop doing this, both for environmental reasons and for common decency.”      KCBS has also learned from a review of city permit records that the system was installed illegally, and may violate water use regulations.      RELATED: What To Do If You’re Concerned About A Homeless Person Sleeping In Your Doorway      The Archdiocese issued a new statement Wednesday morning about the story, saying the church will address the situation at the Cathedral immediately and will have further comment later in the day.

Throughout history, societies have been continuously evolving, marked by significant changes in technology, culture, and lifestyles. As these alterations occur, people might feel a shift in values and expectations, leading to the assumption that time often influences the way they perceive various aspects of life. However, it is essential to recognize that there is a consistent emphasis on tradition and spirituality in people's lives, regardless of the passage of time. Traditions comprise beliefs, customs, and practices that are passed down from generation to generation. They serve as a connection to a community's cultural heritage, ensuring the continuity of shared experiences and fostering a sense of identity. Spirituality, on the other hand, relates to an individual's search for meaning, purpose, and connection. It transcends religious and cultural boundaries and can provide a profound sense of peace and contentment. In times of uncertainty, people often turn to spirituality for comfort, solace, and guidance. As the world continues to change, it is crucial to acknowledge the unwavering role that traditions and spirituality play in sustaining societies and shaping individual values. Despite rapid advancements and shifting priorities, the significance of these cultural elements remains a constant in people's lives. Emphasizing the importance of maintaining a connection to one's roots and finding meaning beyond the material world ensures that people can navigate the uncertainties that come with change, remaining anchored in their cherished beliefs and practices."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: SEOUL — South Korean Foreign Minister Kang, Kyung-wha said on Wednesday that the U.S. and South Korea jointly made the decision to suspend combined military exercises scheduled for August, but would not confirm if her government was given advanced notice before U.S. President Trump announced his intention to cancel the drills, after he met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Singapore on June 12. “We have made it clear that this is a goodwill gesture to strengthen the dialogue momentum at this point, but they are not irreversible. They could quickly come back should we see the dialogue momentum losing speed or North Korea not living up to its denuclearization commitment,” said Foreign Minister Kang. During a press briefing in Seoul, the foreign minister said she was in in close communication with U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo about the drills directly following the Singapore summit. And while the announcement canceling the exercises came suddenly, Kang said, South Korea was also considering this option to keep diplomatic momentum moving forward following the U.S.-North Korea summit where Kim reaffirmed his commitment to the “complete denuclearization” of North Korea. The now cancelled Ulchi Freedom Guardian exercises normally held in August usually bring in 3,000 more American troops from abroad and involve 50,000 South Korean troops. No decision has yet been made whether the other large-scale joint exercise held in the spring would be suspended as well. At the Singapore summit Trump said he would cancel the “war games” that he said were both enormously expensive and “provocative,” as an act of good faith and in response to North Korea’s commitment to denuclearization, its continued suspension of nuclear and missile teats, and the recent closing of its nuclear testing site. North Korea has long called for the end of these joint military exercises that it says are offensive “rehearsals for war.” In the past U.S. officials refused to suspend the joint drills, that they defended as defensive in nature...

If a new organism were discovered, which of the following would most likely be used to classify it into the appropriate kingdom? -","output":"A) Its habitat B) Its appearance C) Its reproductive methods D) Its cellular organization The most appropriate criteria for classifying a newly discovered organism into one of the kingdoms would be: D) Its cellular organization Step 1: Assess the organism's cellular structure Knowing an organism's cellular organization helps identify whether it is prokaryotic or eukaryotic. This distinction divides life forms into two fundamental groups, and is key to proper classification. Step 2: Determine its mode of nutrition Understanding how the organism feeds – whether it produces its own food, absorbs nutrients from the environment, or ingests other organisms – further narrows down its classification. Step 3: Analyze its reproductive methods While several species across kingdoms can share some reproductive methods, assessing this aspect can still help distinguish between certain groups, particularly when used in conjunction with other factors. Step 4: Consider additional characteristics Other factors like habitat or appearance may support the chosen classification, but should not be the primary criteria due to variations within kingdoms. For example, some fungi may resemble plants, but their mode of nutrition and cellular organization would place them in a different kingdom. So, in summary, the cellular organization is the most appropriate characteristic for classifying a new organism because it serves as the fundamental basis for determining its place in the hierarchy of life forms."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Over time, this dish has gained popularity in other countries, specifically in Singapore, where it has become a beloved choice for many food enthusiasts.  The main ingredient in Ayam penyet is fried chicken, which takes center stage in this delectable meal. A unique aspect of this dish is the term \\"smashed\\" or \\"squeezed\\" fried chicken, which refers to the cooking style where the chicken is marinated, typically with a variety of spices and herbs, then cooked through frying. After frying, the chicken is then \\"smashed\\" or \\"squeezed\\" to make it more tender and to further infuse the flavors from the marinade. This process not only creates a distinctive texture for the chicken but also allows the flavors to be absorbed more deeply. Ayam penyet is traditionally served with a spicy sambal sauce that complements the rich taste of the fried chicken. Sambal is an Indonesian condiment made from a mixture of chili peppers, spices, and other ingredients, which provides a powerful kick of heat and flavor to the dish. This combination of crispy fried chicken and spicy sambal elevates the Ayam penyet and makes it utterly irresistible. The serving temperature for Ayam penyet is hot, which ensures that the flavors are at their peak, and the texture of the chicken remains crisp. This characteristic further enhances the overall dining experience, as the dish's warmth adds an element of satisfaction and comfort. Although originating from Indonesia, Ayam penyet has found a home in Singapore's diverse food landscape. The fusion of cultures and flavors in Singapore has provided a fertile ground for this Indonesian dish to thrive, drawing both locals and visitors alike to indulge in the hearty meal. From humble street food stalls to upscale restaurants, Ayam penyet has emerged as a popular and sought-after dish across the region.

Ruth Etting (November 23, 1897 - September 24, 1978) was an American singing star and actress of the 1920s and 1930s, who had over 60 hit recordings and worked in stage, radio, and film. Known as \\"America's sweetheart of song\\", her signature tunes were \\"Shine On, Harvest Moon\\", \\"Ten Cents a Dance\\" and \\"Love Me or Leave Me\\". Her other popular recordings included \\"Button Up Your Overcoat\\", \\"Mean to Me\\", \\"Exactly Like You\\" and \\"Shaking the Blues Away\\". As a young girl in Nebraska, Etting had wanted to be an artist; she drew and sketched everywhere she was able. Etting fell in love with her pianist, Myrl Alderman, who was separated from his wife. In January 1938, she began receiving threatening telephone calls from Snyder, who initially claimed Etting withheld assets from him when the divorce settlement was made. Though the couple was divorced, Snyder was also upset because of reports that she was seeing another man. Snyder told Etting that he would come to California and kill her. When Snyder telephoned and found Etting unavailable, he told his daughter Edith that he \\"would fix her ticket, too\\". He called again that evening; this time Etting took the call with her cousin, Arthur Etting, listening on an extension. Etting requested police protection after the telephone call and arranged for private protection. Apparently believing the danger was over when Snyder did not appear soon after his telephone call, Etting released her bodyguards a few days later.  On October 15, 1938, Snyder detained Myrl Alderman at a local radio station and forced the pianist to take him to his former wife at gunpoint. In the house at the time were Etting and Edith Snyder. Edith, Snyder's daughter by a previous marriage, worked for Etting and remained living with her after the divorce. Snyder held Etting and Alderman at gunpoint; when told his daughter was in another part of the house, he made Etting call her into the room. Snyder said he intended to kill all three, and told them to be quiet. When Myrl Alderman attempted to speak, Snyder shot him. Snyder then told his ex-wife, \\"I've had my revenge, so you can call the police.\\"  Snyder claimed Myrl Alderman pulled a gun and shot at him first and that his ex-wife would not file charges against him because she still loved him. He also claimed he was drunk when he made the telephone threats to Etting in January 1938, saying that at the time his intentions were to kill both his ex-wife and himself. Ruth Etting said that the only gun in the home belonged to her, and after the shooting of Alderman, she was able to go into her bedroom and get it. Upon seeing Etting's gun, Moe Snyder wrested it away from her; it landed on the floor. Snyder's daughter, Edith, picked it up and held it on her father, shooting at him but hitting the floor instead. During a police reenactment of the shooting three days later, Edith Snyder said that she fired at her father to save Ruth Etting, weeping as she continued, \\"I don't yet know whether I am sorry I missed my Dad or whether I am glad\\". Snyder was accused of attempting to murder his ex-wife, his daughter, and Etting's accompanist, Myrl Alderman, the kidnapping of Alderman, as well as California state gun law violations.

The raids just coming to light after a couple of folks came forward and spoke to National Review writer David French, including this woman, Cindy Archer. Archer says she was asleep in her home one night when she was jolted awake when more than a dozen police officers with a battering ram were yelling and pounding on the door. She says she was trying desperately to calm down her dogs, begging the police not to shoot them. She was afraid, given how angry they appeared. She says police would not say why they were there, but they ransacked her home, grabbed computers and phones and told Ms. Archer she could not tell anyone. And there was much more to this story. Michael Lutz is a decorated retired police officer who many say confirmed these raids were politically motivated, and head of Wisconsin Club for Growth, Eric O'Keefe says the raid victims are guilty of nothing more than exercising their right to support conservative causes. All right. Thank you both so much for being here. So, let me start with you on this, Eric. So, you are affiliated with this conservative group, and you know some of the people who were targeted in these raids. What were -- the police were there on a prosecutor's push and a judge's order, because they were suspected of pushing conservative issues, basically. That's the charge. Just like in the IRS deal, they were being targeted for supporting conservative issues. ERIC O'KEEFE, WISCONSIN CLUB FOR GROWTH: Right. They were being targeted based on a theory which is completely unsupportable under Wisconsin law. But apart from even that, the reality is, as I told my colleagues as soon as I was able to speak to them, you were attacked for your virtue, for your effectiveness, that's why they were attacked. Because the left was tired of losing election after election after election. They correctly identified some of the most important communicators of political messages in Wisconsin and raided their family homes with kids at home. They knew the kids were at home. They knew the schedules. They came in the dark and put aside whether people should have filed different campaign financial reports. Is this an appropriate tactic for any kind of campaign finance question? They already had our e-mails, we subsequently learned. They already had our bank records. They knew what we were doing. We were proud of what we were doing. They didn't ask us. These raids were not really based on any belief that they would find incriminating information. KELLY: And the person at the heart of it is the prosecutor, John Chisolm, and Mike, that's somebody you know well. And this is a man who was married to a union steward who didn't like Scott Walker, who didn't like his policies and certainly didn't like the conservative efforts in Wisconsin. MICHAEL LUTZ, RETIRED MILWAUKEE POLICE OFFICER: That's correct, Megyn. KELLY: And so how were you privy to that information? I mean, what evidence, if any, do you have that it was politically motivated, them going after these conservatives? LUTZ: Sure, I was in a unique position to have some personal conversations with John Chisolm during my time as a police officer. I was working intimately with John on gun crime issues, when I retired from the police department after getting shot, John was a mentor of mine. Good friend of mine. He talked me into going to law school. KELLY: So did he tell you this stuff? I mean, did he admit that he was doing it for political reasons? LUTZ: He did. In a personal conversation in his office, he had stated that he believed it was his personal responsibility to stop Governor Walker and all Republicans from continuing on with Act 10 and supporting Act 10 and Governor Walker. KELLY: Eric, do you -- are you under a secrecy order right now? Because everybody has been told not to speak. O'KEEFE: Yes. An unconstitutional secrecy order. And I'm defying the secrecy order. KELLY: Are you fearful given the tactics we've seen? O'KEEFE: No, I'm not. I would ask them if they want to arrest me to give a phone call and I'll turn myself in. KELLY: You -- the raid victims in this case -- the raid targets in this case were harassed in the middle of the night in front of their children, often in front of their neighbors. Some in the morning when school buses were going by, and little children were seeing families with several police officers there and battering rams, and yet all of them were told keep your mouths shut. You're not allowed to speak of it? O'KEEFE: Right. And the -- and the children were told -- the children were detained from going to school at the appropriate time. Parent asked -- in two cases I know of, what do they tell the school. And they were told to lie, to lie about why they were late. Children's computers were seized with homework on them. And they were told to lie about it. So, you know, the old thing, the dog ate my homework. How does it sound, you know, I lost my computer. Where did you lose it? I don't know. So, there's a little bit of a... KELLY: Are these people going to be sitting there thinking -- and I realize there is this law in Wisconsin that allows supposedly -- it's being challenged -- this secrecy to go on while they're investigating this kind of case, but these people have got to be asking themselves whether this is still the United States of America. O'KEEFE: They did. They were stunned. It was stunning. It's been a stunning attack. And I have sued John Chisolm. He's not fit to serve in public office. I want him removed from office. KELLY: He denies all of this. I mean, he does not -- he says this is legit. They had a judge sign off on it, Mike. He wasn't out there alone they had the cooperation of the courts. LUTZ: But, Megyn, this is why I came forward in the first place, because through the conversations and through what I witnessed in the district attorney's office, John Chisolm had become so hyper political and hyper partisan that he had weaponized his district attorney's office to go after and prosecute and persecute all those who had a different political ideology than him. And that's why I came forward and that's why it's just so disgusting and un-American what's going on here. KELLY: We're going to stay on this. We are very grateful to the two of you for coming on tonight. And again, our offer to John Chisolm to come on and offer his side of the story remains.

What are the most important parts of this text?","output":"The most important parts of this text involve the claims that a series of raids against supporters of Governor Scott Walker were politically motivated. The raids allegedly targeted individuals exercising their rights to support conservative causes and were led by prosecutor John Chisolm, who has been accused of weaponizing the District Attorney's office for targeting political rivals. The piece features interviews with Eric O'Keefe, head of Wisconsin Club for Growth, and Michael Lutz, a retired police officer, who both share their perspectives on the raids and Chisolm's motivations.

As I have stated in prior reviews, I am NOT a Thai food professional!  Don't get me wrong, I like Thai food more than I should and I have been on a kick the past few months, but I rarely varie from Pad Thai or Curry.  That said, I was EXTREMELY tempted to wonder off my path and attempt a new item or two (but didn't due to a long road trip home and I did NOT want to chance something not sitting right - if you know what I mean).

The restaurant is not the nicest I have been in (you can tell from the outside you will not be experiencing fine dinning) - but again, I am not really complaining.  The place is clean, just older.  My wife and I enjoyed looking at pictures of all the famous people who have enjoyed a meal or two here and even though the place was packed, we got a table quickly and our food came out fast.

WHITE HOUSE — President Donald Trump, after a tactical retreat this week on immigration policy, demonstrated Friday that there is no strategic shift to his overall tough approach to those attempting to illegally enter the country, and vowing to \\"end the immigration crisis, once and for all.\\" U.S. immigration laws, Trump declared, are \\"the weakest in the history of the world.\\" Trump made the remarks in an auditorium in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, adjacent to the White House, where he presided over an event with so-called \\"Angel Families,\\" those who have had relatives killed by people who entered the country illegally. \\"Your loss will not have been in vain,\\" the president told the families, who held large photos of their slain relatives. \\"We will secure our borders … the word will get out. Got to have a safe country. We're going to have a safe country.\\" Trump called family members to the presidential lectern to recount how their loved ones had been killed by those who were in the United States illegally. Several of those speaking condemned the media for ignoring the stories of the victims and praised Trump and Vice President Mike Pence for their attention to border security. Crime assertion Trump, in his remarks, also suggested those illegally in the United States commit more crimes on a statistical basis than citizens or resident aliens. However, studies have shown that undocumented immigrants are less likely to commit a crime in the U.S. than native-born citizens, including one published by the libertarian CATO Institute this year. Following intense domestic and international condemnation, Trump on Wednesday signed an order ending his administration's practice of separation of children from their families while parents were being prosecuted for crossing the border illegally. The administration's recently implemented \\"zero tolerence\\" policy led to the criminal prosecutions of undocumented border crossers, which in turn led to federal officials separating adults and their children.

Under his progressive government the old regime was tenuously reconciled to his liberal policies. During this period of upheaval in the provinces he declared that all the estates of the Church, its congregations, and its religious orders were national property—though in Valencia, most of this property was subsequently acquired by the local bourgeoisie. City life in Valencia carried on in a revolutionary climate, with frequent clashes between liberals and republicans, and the constant threat of reprisals by the Carlist troops of General Cabrera.\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"Espartero's rule ended in May 1841."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here are possible answers to this question: - gain weight - wait patiently - stand erect - promise to do - washing dishes  I believe the correct choice is \\"washing dishes\\", here's why: The answer to this question is:","output":"\\"Washing dishes\\". When there are dishes astray in the kitchen, it means that they are not in their proper place or are dirty. The most appropriate action to take in this situation is to wash them. Here's the reasoning for each option: - Gain weight: This option is not related to the situation at hand. Gaining weight is a bodily result of an individual's diet and exercise habits, and it's unrelated to the dishes in the kitchen. - Wait patiently: While this could be a choice if someone else was responsible for washing the dishes, it doesn't actively address the issue of the dishes being astray. It's more of a passive approach and doesn't provide a solution. - Stand erect: This option is unrelated to the issue of dishes in the kitchen. Standing erect refers to a person's posture, which is not connected to washing dishes or organizing them. - Promise to do: This choice is vague and doesn't specifically state what action will be taken. Promises can be broken, and this option doesn't assure that the dishes will actually be dealt with. - Washing dishes: This is the correct option. When there are dishes astray in the kitchen, it's important to clean and put them away in their proper place. Washing the dishes addresses the issue promptly and contributes to maintaining a clean and organized kitchen. In conclusion, when there are dishes astray in the kitchen, the best action to take is washing dishes in order to keep the kitchen clean, organized, and ready for use."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Let's break it down and analyze the premise and hypothesis in detail. Premise: The premise states that there is a man in a colorful outfit with cherries imprinted on the sleeve, pulling a cart with bags. Here, the critical pieces of information are: 1. The man has a colorful outfit. 2. The outfit has cherries imprinted on the sleeve. 3. The man is pulling a cart with bags. Hypothesis: The hypothesis is that the man with the cart is wearing a shirt with a cherry design. To determine if the hypothesis is true based on the premise, we need to evaluate if the information provided in the premise supports the hypothesis. Let's examine the hypothesis in light of the information given in the premise: 1. The man has a colorful outfit - This point does not directly address the cherry design but indicates that the man's outfit is visually striking. It does not, however, conflict with the hypothesis either. 2. The outfit has cherries imprinted on the sleeve - This detail directly addresses the cherry design mentioned in the hypothesis. Since the cherries are imprinted on the sleeve, it is reasonable to assert that the shirt has a cherry design. 3. The man is pulling a cart with bags - This piece of information does not relate to the cherry design but contributes to the overall setup of the scenario. In conclusion, as the premise states that there are cherries imprinted on the sleeve of the man's outfit, and the hypothesis concerns the man wearing a shirt with a cherry design, we can conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true. The information about the colorful outfit and the cart with bags only adds context to the situation, and these details do not conflict with the hypothesis.

The United States Capitol, often called the Capitol Building, is the home of the United States Congress, and the seat of the legislative branch of the U.S. federal government. It sits atop Capitol Hill at the eastern end of the National Mall in Washington, D.C. Though not at the geographic center of the Federal District, the Capitol forms the origin point for the District's street-numbering system and the District's four quadrants.  The original building was completed in 1800 and was subsequently expanded, particularly with the addition of the massive dome, and expanded chambers for the bicameral legislature, the House of Representatives in the south wing and the Senate in the north wing. Like the principal buildings of the executive and judicial branches, the Capitol is built in a distinctive neoclassical style and has a white exterior. Both its east and west elevations are formally referred to as \\"fronts\\", though only the east front was intended for the reception of visitors and dignitaries.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. By. Ashley Collman. The 12-year-old girl who was mauled by a raccoon as a baby is back at home after successfully undergoing surgery to create a new ear. Charlotte Ponce of Spring Lake, Michigan was just three-months-old in 2002 when her young parents left her at home with the pet and she lost her right ear, nose and part of her lip in an attack. Two years ago, Doctor Kongrit Chaiyasate repaired little Charlotte's nose and now he's focusing on giving her a new ear. Going home: Charlotte Ponce, 12, of Spring Lake, Michigan was released from the hospital Monday after undergoing a seven-hour surgery to implant cartilage into her arm. Revolutionary surgery: The lung cartilage was molded into the shape of an ear and inserted into Charlotte's arm during the April 15 surgery. Growing: The cartilage will continue to grow in her arm for the next few months before doctors will attach it to her ear. Pictured above on Monday. One last surgery: Little Charlotte will return to the hospital in June for her surgery, which will hopefully be her last. Pictured above on Monday. 'The raccoon pretty much ate the right side of her face, all the way back to the ear,' Charlotteâ€™s adoptive mom Sharon Ponce told ABCNews.com. 'Now, all she wants is to wear two earrings.' That dream of pierced ears came closer to reality on April 15, when she underwent a seven-hour surgery to embed lung cartilage, shaped into an ear lobe, into her arm where it will continue to grow until June. That's when Charlotte will go under the knife for hopefully the last time as Dr Chaiyaste attaches the cartilage to her ear. Brave: Charlotte Ponce was just three months old when a raccoon chewed off her nose, ear and lips. Pictured above just before she underwent the surgery on April 15. But this last procedure will be the most complex yet, as it is claimed it has only been performed twice before.[. Dr Chaiyasate admitted the procedure is not easy and he will only have one chance to get it right, so he has been practicing on a potato. Dr Chaiyasate, of Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak, Michigan, told WBIV:. 'As plastic surgeons we need to think outside the box a little bit -. what can we do to make a life long reconstruction for her. 'I've been practicing carving potato last weekend using this as a template. It's not easy.' Mauled: Charlotte Ponce as a baby before and after the attack. Her adopted parents say she is still a happy girl. He said he could not guarantee success, but would try his best. Charlotte's adopted mother Sharon Ponce said people from as far as Britain and Australia had contacted the family to tell them what an inspiration the girl has been. She was just a newborn when her 18-year-old mother and 23-year-old father left her home alone with the pet. The raccoon was thought to have escaped from its cage after a door was left open when food had been dropped in, and no one was there to save the baby when she was attacked. Her great-aunt Sharon and great-uncle Tim only found out about the attack with horror when they watched that night's news bulletin. They gained custody of Charlotte and her brother Marshall, who was then 15 months old, and they and their friends raised more than 10,000 to help pay for her trips in and out of hospital. Sharon had to quit her job at a daycare center to look after Charlotte after doctors said she would need full time care. Although ears have been made out of ribs before, the method of 'growing' the ear inside the forearm is extremely rare. Remarkable: Charlotte with her adopted mother Sharon and Dr Kongkrit Chaiyasate after he built her a new nose in a 2012 operation. He said this next surgery will hopefully be the last major work she has done. Attack: It has been a slow recovery for Charlotte, who lived for a decade without a reconstructed nose. Intact: Charlotte as a baby with her brother Marshall before she was attacked in late 2002. Happy family: Charlotte now lives with (from left) her great-uncle Tim, great-aunt Sharon and brother Marshall. It has to be done because Charlotte's ear was so badly damaged that the foundations of an ear structure no longer exist inside her head. Charlotte previously had a prosthetic ear fitted but it was not an ideal solution and soon became infected and uncomfortable. Yet despite the enormous damage, there is one miracle. Even before the extensive surgery which will grant her a new quality of life, Charlotte's hearing has been largely unaffected. What are highlight points for this article?","output":"This article is about a 12-year-old girl named Charlotte Ponce who lost her right ear, nose, and part of her lip when she was a baby due to a raccoon attack. Doctor Kongrit Chaiyasate has already repaired her nose and is now working on giving her a new ear. Charlotte had a surgery where lung cartilage shaped like an ear lobe was put into her arm, and it will keep growing there until June. Then, she will have another surgery where the cartilage will be attached to her ear. This will hopefully be her last surgery. Despite losing her ear, Charlotte's hearing has not been affected much."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Question: suppose the dishwasher already has detergent happens, how will it affect MORE sunlight arriving at the Earth.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer to this question is:","output":"To answer this question, we first need to understand the relationship between the events mentioned: 1. The gravity of the Sun pulls its mass inward. 2. There is a lot of pressure on the Sun. 3. The pressure forces atoms of hydrogen to fuse together in nuclear reactions. 4. The energy from the reactions gives off different kinds of light. 5. The light travels to the Earth. 6. The dishwasher already has detergent. 7. MORE sunlight arriving at the Earth. Now let's analyze if there is any connection between these events: The dishwasher having detergent seems completely unrelated to the events 1 to 5 that describe the process of the Sun emitting light. It is an independent event that has no influence on the Sun's behavior or the light reaching the Earth. Now let's consider the effect of event 7 (MORE sunlight arriving at the Earth) on event 2 (There is a lot of pressure on the Sun). More sunlight reaching Earth could be due to changes in the Sun's behavior, such as an increase in solar activity or intensity of electromagnetic radiation. However, it could also be due to changes in the Earth's atmosphere, such as a reduction in air pollution or cloud coverage, which would not affect the pressure on the Sun. Given this information, we can conclude that the dishwasher having detergent has no effect on more sunlight arriving at the Earth. Moreover, the supposed perturbation has no effect on the second effect mentioned (the pressure on the Sun), as it is an independent event with no connection to the solar processes. So, regarding the influence of the supposed perturbation on the second effect mentioned, the answer is: no effect."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Step 2: Analyze the hypothesis. The hypothesis claims that winter is the busiest peak season for the location and it is impossible to avoid the crowds. Step 3: Compare the premise and the hypothesis. The premise explicitly states that winters are deserted, which means that the island has fewer visitors during this time (opposed to being busy). The hypothesis, on the other hand, claims that winters are the busiest peak season and it's impossible to avoid the crowds. Step 4: Determine if the premise entails the hypothesis.

As the group moves, the predator has greater difficulty targeting an individual prey animal. The zebra has been suggested by the zoologist Martin Stevens and his colleagues as an example of this. When stationary, a single zebra stands out because of its large size. To reduce the risk of attack, zebras often travel in herds. The striped patterns of all the zebras in the herd may confuse the predator, making it harder for the predator to focus in on an individual zebra. Furthermore, when moving rapidly, the zebra stripes create a confusing, flickering motion dazzle effect in the eye of the predator.  Two packs of lions were hunting large herbivores.

Hastings is most famous for this battle which was fought in which month of 1066?","output":"The Battle of Hastings, an event of great historical significance and an essential turning point in English history, occurred on October 14, 1066. This battle is arguably the most famous due to its far-reaching consequences that decisively shaped the future of England and Western Europe. The battle was fought between the armies of the English King Harold Godwinson and the invading Norman forces led by Duke William of Normandy, who later became known as William the Conqueror. The backdrop of this conflict can be traced to the struggles for succession following the death of Edward the Confessor, the King of England, in January 1066. Edward's passing without an heir led to a competition among various claimants to the English throne. Harold Godwinson was named as the successor and crowned king, but Duke William of Normandy, Harald Hardrada of Norway, and other regional nobles all claimed rights to the throne as well. Duke William of Normandy, being closely related to Edward the Confessor and having the Pope's blessing, launched a major invasion force from Normandy and landed on the southern coast of England. Meanwhile, King Harold had to quell a Norse invasion led by Harald Hardrada and his own renegade brother, Tostig Godwinson. The Battle of Stamford Bridge on September 25, 1066, saw the ultimate defeat of the Norse invaders and proved King Harold as a competent military leader. However, Harold's victory was short-lived. Duke William of Normandy landed on the English coast just a few days after the Battle of Stamford Bridge, forcing King Harold to march his exhausted troops southwards to defend against the Normans. As a result, Harold's army had insufficient time to recover and reinforce itself before the pivotal Battle of Hastings. The battle itself was brutal and closely contested. The English, led by King Harold, deployed a defensive shield wall formation, while the Normans, led by Duke William, relied on a mix of infantry, archers, and mounted knights. The fighting endured for an entire day, with both sides sustaining massive casualties. Accounts of the battle suggest that the English line held firmly until a feigned retreat by the Norman troops lured a portion of the English army out of position. This maneuver enabled the Normans to breach the shield wall, thus turning the tide of the battle in their favor. King Harold was killed during the engagement, and his death marked the end of Anglo-Saxon rule in England. Duke William of Normandy ascended to the English throne as William the Conqueror, blending the Norman, English, and French ways of life, languages, and traditions, and ushering in a new era for England. The Battle of Hastings forever changed the course of English history and laid the foundation for the modern nation we know today."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Moreover, several organizations (e.g., The American Society for Microbiology (ASM), American Public Health Association (APHA) and the American Medical Association (AMA)) have called for restrictions on antibiotic use in food animal production and an end to all nontherapeutic uses.[citation needed] However, commonly there are delays in regulatory and legislative actions to limit the use of antibiotics, attributable partly to resistance against such regulation by industries using or selling antibiotics, and to the time required for research to test causal links between their use and resistance to them. Two federal bills (S.742 and H.R. 2562) aimed at phasing out nontherapeutic use of antibiotics in US food animals were proposed, but have not passed.

The show was billed as the first spin-off of All in the Family, on which Beatrice Arthur had made two appearances in the character of Maude, Edith Bunker's cousin. Like All in the Family, Maude was a sitcom with topical storylines created by producer Norman Lear. Can we conclude that was maude a spin off of all in the family?","output":"Yes, it can be concluded that Maude was indeed a spin-off from the television show All in the Family. This conclusion can be drawn based on the details provided. First, let's understand the terms. A spin-off in the context of television is a program featuring a character or characters that originally appeared in a different series. There are two primary ways a spin-off can be made: one is when a character from the original show leaves and appears in a completely different setting and usually in their own new storyline. The second is when a group of characters in the show are taken and a new show is created, focusing on this group. Let's refer back to the information on Maude. The show was billed as the first spin-off of All in the Family - this statement explicitly suggests that Maude is a product of All in the Family and hence qualifies it as a spin-off. Beatrice Arthur who played the character Maude, is stated to have made two appearances on All in the Family before the inception of Maude. She is described as Edith Bunker's cousin, which signifies her role's linkage to the original series. This character continuity is typical of many spin-offs and supports the assertion that Maude was a spin-off. Additionally, it’s notable that both shows were created by Norman Lear, further solidifying the connection between them. Often, spin-offs are initiated by the same creative team that helmed the original series, lending thematic and stylistic coherence between the two productions. Furthermore, noting that Maude, like All in the Family, was a sitcom with topical storylines suggests a narrative continuation of the style and structure applied in All in the Family. So, considering all these points, the assertion that Maude is a spin-off of All in the Family is supported by substantial evidence based on the historical context, character continuity, creator commonality, and similarity in genre and thematic elements."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who conducted the Munich Philharmonic in Munich on September 12, 1910? ?  The Symphony No. 8 in E-flat major by Gustav Mahler is one of the largest-scale choral works in the classical concert repertoire. Because it requires huge instrumental and vocal forces it is frequently called the \\"Symphony of a Thousand\\", although the work is normally presented with far fewer than a thousand performers and the composer did not sanction that name. The work was composed in a single inspired burst, at Maiernigg in southern Austria in the summer of 1906. The last of Mahler's works that was premiered in his lifetime, the symphony was a critical and popular success when he conducted the Munich Philharmonic in its first performance, in Munich, on 12 September 1910. The fusion of song and symphony had been a characteristic of Mahler's early works. In his \\"middle\\" compositional period after 1901, a change of direction led him to produce three purely instrumental symphonies. The Eighth, marking the end of the middle period, returns to a combination of orchestra and voice in a symphonic context. The structure of the work is unconventional; instead of the normal framework of several movements, the piece is in two parts. Part I is based on the Latin text of a 9th-century Christian hymn for Pentecost, Veni creator spiritus (\\"Come, Creator Spirit\\"), and Part II is a setting of the words from the closing scene of Goethe's Faust. The two parts are unified by a common idea, that of redemption through the power of love, a unity conveyed through shared musical themes. Mahler had been convinced from the start of the work's significance; in renouncing the pessimism that had marked much of his music, he offered the Eighth as an expression of confidence in the eternal human spirit. In the period following the composer's death, performances were comparatively rare. However, from the mid-20th century onwards the symphony has been heard regularly in concert halls all over the world, and has been recorded many times. While recognising its wide popularity, modern critics have divided opinions on the work; Theodor W....","output":"The last name of the person who conducted the Munich Philharmonic in Munich on September 12, 1910 is Mahler."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: What is the answer for the question: What is the full real name of the person that has hair loss? from the following article ?  11-year-old Annie Parker is living the perfect young life, loved by all, and especially by her mother, father, and older sister. But none of them knows that something horrible is stalking their perfect family. On a fall afternoon in 1976, young Annie hears a noise from upstairs. Her mother has collapsed and died, and an agonizing downward spiral begins. At UC Berkeley a brilliant research geneticist named Mary-Claire King is embarking on something of a personal crusade to uncover the genetic roots of breast cancer. While still in her twenties, she has already made a famous discovery that made the cover of Science—quantifying the genetic variation between humans and chimpanzees. But her conviction that there is a hereditary basis to at least some forms of breast cancer is not widely shared. Nevertheless, her tireless research throughout the 1980s would end in a medical breakthrough—the discovery of the location of the BRCA1 hereditary breast cancer gene—considered one of the most important scientific discoveries of the twentieth century.At the age of 19, after the sudden death of her father, Anne marries Paul and soon is pregnant. She struggles to find a way in the world with her equally young but misguided husband and her older sister, Joan Parker who tries to become a surrogate parent to Anne. But, cruelly, Joan contracts the same cancer that killed their mother, and in a few months, she, too, is dead. Annie is diagnosed with the same disease that killed her mother and sister—breast cancer. It is severe, and surgery and chemotherapy, with all its accompanying difficulties, soon follows. She loses her hair, and if that wasn't enough to endure, her husband, never really mature or stable, has begun an affair with Anne's closest friend Louise, and leaves her.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: I have a new situation: Hannah and Joe are two colleagues. They both study horticulture. They've been studying ants lately for their entomology class. Hannah studied ants that farm aphids, while Joe studied ants that farm fungus.  But I can use this background: Some species of ants farm aphids, protecting them on the plants where they are feeding, and consuming the honeydew the aphids release from the terminations of their alimentary canals. This is a mutualistic relationship, with these dairying ants milking the aphids by stroking them with their antennae. Although mutualistic, the feeding behaviour of aphids is altered by ant attendance. Aphids attended by ants tend to increase the production of honeydew in smaller drops with a greater concentration of amino acids.Some farming ant species gather and store the aphid eggs in their nests over the winter. In the spring, the ants carry the newly hatched aphids back to the plants. Some species of dairying ants (such as the European yellow meadow ant, Lasius flavus) manage large herds of aphids that feed on roots of plants in the ant colony. Queens leaving to start a new colony take an aphid egg to found a new herd of underground aphids in the new colony. These farming ants protect the aphids by fighting off aphid predators.  What is an answer for this question: Which student learned less about ants that manage large herds of aphids ?

Many of them cause plant diseases called powdery mildew.  - Uncinula is a genus of fungi . Its species are plant pathogens that cause powdery mildew diseases on various plant hosts . The genus is characterized by its dark chasmothecia which bear filamentous , hyaline appendages with hooked tips . Over one hundred species have been described from mostly dicotyledenous hosts . Braun and Takamatsu ( 2000 ) suggested that Uncinula should be considered a later synonym of Erysiphe ; not all subsequent researchers have accepted their conclusions . One notorious species , Uncinula necator ( syn . Erysiphe necator ) , attacks various species of grapes ( Vitis spp . ) and can cause yield losses in European wine grapes . Other Uncinula species attack a wide variety of dicotyledonous plants .  - Powdery mildew is a fungal disease that affects a wide range of plants. Powdery mildew diseases are caused by many different species of fungi in the order Erysiphales, with \\"Podosphaera xanthii\\" (a.k.a. \\"Sphaerotheca fuliginea\\") being the most commonly reported cause. \\"Erysiphe cichoracearum\\" was formerly reported to be the primary causal organism throughout most of the world. Powdery mildew is one of the easier plant diseases to identify, as its symptoms are quite distinctive. Infected plants display white powdery spots on the leaves and stems. The lower leaves are the most affected, but the mildew can appear on any above-ground part of the plant. As the disease progresses, the spots get larger and denser as large numbers of asexual spores are formed, and the mildew may spread up and down the length of the plant.  - Erysiphe is a genus of fungi in the Erysiphaceae family. Many of the species in this genus are plant pathogens which cause powdery mildew.  - Erysiphe cichoracearum is a plant pathogen that causes powdery mildew disease of cucurbits, including melon, cucumber, pumpkin, and squash. The primary symptoms are white, powder-like spots on the leaves and stems. \\"Sphaerotheca fuliginea\\" causes a similar looking powdery mildew of cucurbits.  - Mildew is a form of fungus. It is distinguished from its closely related counterpart, mold (British English: mould), largely by its color: molds appear in shades of black, blue, red, and green, whereas mildew is white. It appears as a thin, superficial growth consisting of minute hyphae (fungal filaments) produced especially on living plants or organic matter such as wood, paper or leather. Both mold and mildew produce distinct offensive odors, and both have been identified as the cause of certain human ailments.

Summarize: Officers have used dogs to search the sites and \\"ground penetrating radar\\" to look for disturbed earth. The searches follow a request from the Metropolitan Police, who launched a fresh investigation into Madeleine's disappearance last July. Madeleine, of Rothley, Leicestershire, was three when she went missing from her family's holiday apartment on 3 May 2007. See the details below to find out about what happened that day and for the location of the latest police searches. 15:30-17:30 Charity men seen 20:30 McCanns go for dinner 21:05 McCanns check on children 21:15 Jane Tanner sees man and child 22:00 Irish family sees man and child 22:00 McCanns raise alarm Scotland Yard says detectives are looking into possible links to burglaries and bogus charity collections in the area at the time. They have released two e-fit images of Portuguese men they would like to identify. There were four separate sightings of charity collectors on the afternoon of 3 May in Praia da Luz. One man approached a property on Rua do Ramalhete, near the Ocean Club, at about 16:00. Another collector called at another apartment on 25 or 26 April. Police say there was also a four-fold increase in the number of burglaries in the area between January and May 2007 and one possible scenario was that Madeleine had disturbed a burglar. The McCanns were on holiday with a group of friends who met for dinner each evening at a Tapas bar on the Ocean Club complex where they were staying. On the day Madeleine went missing, Mr and Mrs McCann left their apartment at 20:30 and headed to the restaurant. Throughout the evening, adults from the group would leave at regular intervals to check on their children. A member of the group - Matthew Oldfield - left at 21:00, shortly followed by Gerry McCann. Mr McCann left the retaurant to check on his children at about 21:05. When he reached the apartment, he noticed the bedroom door was open wider than it had been left. On his return to the restaurant, he stopped to chat to a guest. Matthew Oldfield also checked on the McCanns' apartment at about 21:30. Hearing no noise from the children's bedroom, he assumed all was well and left without seeing Madeleine. Having left the table to check on her own children, another member of the group, Jane Tanner, saw a man carrying a child close to the McCanns' apartment. This sighting, which had previously been the focus of the investigation, has now been discounted by police. Detectives said the man was almost certainly an innocent British holiday-maker collecting his two-year-old daughter from a nearby creche. An Irish family returning from a night out saw a man carrying a blonde-haired child, aged about three or four, possibly wearing pyjamas. He was walking down a street towards the beach at about 22:00. The beach is a few minutes' walk from the McCanns' apartment. Two of the witnesses have helped produce an e-fit of the man they saw. They described him as white, aged in his 30s, of medium build and medium height, with short brown hair. After friend Matthew Oldfield had checked on the McCanns' children half an hour previously, Kate McCann returned to the apartment at 22:00. It was then that she noticed the children's bedroom window was open, the shutter raised and Madeleine gone. The first search area was cordoned off by police at the beginning of June, but nothing of interest was found. It is situated south-west of the Ocean Club complex, where the McCann family were staying in 2007. The scrubland, about the size of three football pitches, is surrounded by flats and villas and overlooks the sea. The second area is on the other side of the Praia da Luz, close to the main road leading out of town. A third location was also investigated across the road from the second search area. On 11 June, police said their searches had not yielded any results. Summary:","output":"Madeleine McCann, a three-year-old from Rothley, went missing from her family's holiday apartment in Praia da Luz on May 3, 2007. The family and friends were dining nearby and periodically checking on the children. The timeline includes various sightings of men carrying children around the time Madeleine disappeared. Police are investigating possible connections to burglaries and bogus charity collections in the area and have released e-fit images of two Portuguese men. Despite searches with dogs and ground-penetrating radar, police have not found any significant leads in the case."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Sakuni is a prince from the kingdom of Gandhara. After his kingdom is attacked by Duryodhana and his family is starved in Duryodhana's prison, Sakuni is chosen by the king of Gandhara to survive. The king of Gandhara believed that by keeping Sakuni alive, there would be a chance for survival.

Multi-choice problem: Based on the sentence \\"A man doing a skate trick on a metal railing.\\", is the sentence \\"A man on skates.\\" a true sentence? Options are: * yes * it is not possible to tell * no","output":"Yes, the sentence \\"A man on skates\\" can be considered a true sentence based on the information provided in the original sentence, \\"A man doing a skate trick on a metal railing.\\" Here is a detailed explanation of the reasoning behind this conclusion: First, let's break down the elements present in the original sentence. 1. There is a man mentioned in the sentence, which is the primary subject. 2. He is performing an activity, which is doing a skate trick. 3. The location of that activity is specified, which is on a metal railing. Now, let's analyze the second sentence, \\"A man on skates.\\" We need to determine if this sentence is a true representation of the information present in the original sentence. 1. The second sentence also mentions a man, which is consistent with the original sentence. 2. The activity or state of the man is not explicitly mentioned in the second sentence, but the fact that he is \\"on skates\\" implies the involvement of skates in his activity. 3. The location is not mentioned in the second sentence, so it doesn't conflict with the information provided in the first sentence. When comparing the two sentences, we can infer that the man in the original sentence is using some form of skates, such as a skateboard, inline skates, or roller skates, to perform a trick on a metal railing. From this, it stands to reason that the man is indeed \\"on skates.\\" As a result, the sentence \\"A man on skates\\" does not contradict the information provided in the original sentence and can be considered a true sentence based on the available information."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Choose your answer from: [+] her personal attitudes may affect her students if she is prejudiced; [+] she need to improve herself too; [+] she is also often influenced by her students; [+] she may not have a constant attitude towards some controversial sues; Q: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Of all the areas of learning the most important is the development of attitudes. Emotional reactions as well as logical thought processes affect the behavior of most people. \\"The burnt child fears the fire\\" is one instance; another is the rise of figures like Hitler. Both these examples point up the fact that attitudes come from experience. In the one case the experience was direct and impressive; in the other it was indirect and gradual. The classroom teacher in the elementary school is in strategic position to influence attitudes. This is true partly because children acquire attitudes from those adults whose word they respect. Another reason it is true is that pupils often search somewhat deeply into a subject in school that has only been touched upon at home or has possibly never occurred to them before. To a child who has previously acquire little knowledge of Mexico, his teacher's method of handling such a unit would greatly affect his attitude toward Mexicans. The teacher can develop proper attitudes through social studies, science matters, the very atmosphere of the classroom, etc. However, when children come to school with undesirable attitudes, it is unwise to attempt to change their feelings by criticizing them. The teacher can achieve the proper effect by helping them obtain constructive experience. To illustrate, first-grade pupils, afraid of policemen will probably change their attitudes after a classroom talk with the neighborhood officer in which he explains how he protects them. In the same way, a class of older children can develop attitudes through discussion, research, outside reading and all-day trips.

Question: In the author's opinion, a teacher must constantly evaluate her own attitudes because  _  . Answer: A:","output":"In the author's opinion, a teacher must constantly evaluate her own attitudes because her personal attitudes may affect her students if she is prejudiced. This is especially true in respect to controversial issues and questions, as children should be encouraged to reach their own decisions as a result of objective analysis of all the facts. A teacher's personal attitudes can have a significant impact on how students perceive and respond to different topics and situations. If a teacher holds prejudiced beliefs or takes a biased stance on certain subjects, that bias is likely to be passed on to the students, shaping their attitudes as well. It is crucial for a teacher to always be self-aware and ensure that they are promoting an open-minded and inclusive learning environment, where students can form their own opinions and develop proper attitudes informed by a fair assessment of all available information. Furthermore, the teacher should also strive to improve themselves and be aware of the influence their students may have on them, as it is crucial for their growth and adaptability in catering to a diverse classroom environment. This constant self-evaluation allows for a healthy and constructive atmosphere that benefits both the teacher and the students."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Process:  - You plant vegetable seeds in the ground - You water the seeds - You wait for the seeds to sprout - You keep the area free of pests and weeds while the plants grow - You thin out the plants as they get bigger to give them space to grow - You remove the vegetables from the plants when they are ripe.  suppose less seeds sprouted happens, how will it affect MORE vegetables.

How to repair a leaking irrigation system  Use a bucket and scoop or dig trenches to drain away any excess water and mud.  Wipe the area clean with rags. Keep the area as free of water, dirt, and mud as possible during the repair. Choose from: [i] Treat top to bottom area with fluid and allow to drain completely. Use a rag to help loosen dirt.. [ii] Use a mitre box or pipe cutter to cut away the affected pipe and/or fittings, making sure that the cuts are square with the pipe. File away any rough edges on the end of the pipe where it was cut.. [iii] Once at the trench, raise the water, or splash several gallons from the hose to thoroughly flush out any excess water and mud. Fill the bucket with 2 gallons of water.. [iv] Use a sponge to remove any debris from inside the irrigation system. Use water from a hose to remove any remaining water that may have spilled over the entrance and exit..","output":"Option [ii] appears to be the most appropriate next step in repairing a leaking irrigation system. Here is the detailed explanation of the process from the beginning: 1. Begin by using a bucket and a scoop, or dig trenches, to drain away any excess water and mud from the leaking area of the irrigation system. 2. Wipe the area clean with rags, ensuring that it is as free of water, dirt, and mud as possible during the repair. This will help you to locate the source of the leak and properly assess the damage. 3. Utilize a mitre box or pipe cutter to cut away the affected pipe and/or fittings, making sure that the cuts are square with the pipe. This step is crucial for making a clean and precise cut, which will enable you to make a strong and leak-free connection when replacing the damaged section of the pipe. 4. File away any rough edges on the end of the pipe where it was cut. This will ensure a smooth surface for attaching the new pipe or fitting, helping to prevent future leaks. 5. Proceed by measuring and cutting the necessary replacement pipe or fitting. Be sure to measure the length of the cut pipe precisely, in order to fit it appropriately into place with the existing irrigation system. 6. Before installing the new pipe or fitting, clean the exposed ends of the existing pipes and the replacement piece, removing any debris, dust, or dirt that may have accumulated. This will help to create a secure connection and prevent future leaks. 7. Apply a PVC primer and appropriate adhesive to the ends of the pipe and the new fitting. Then, attach the replacement piece securely to the existing irrigation system, ensuring that it is properly aligned and connected. 8. Allow adequate time for the adhesive to dry and create a strong bond between the pipes. This will ensure that the repair is durable and resistant to leaks. 9. Once the adhesive has fully dried and set, turn on the irrigation system to test for any leaks and ensure that the repair was successful. If necessary, make any additional adjustments to the repair area. 10. Finally, refill the trenches with soil and compact it to prevent any future damage or shifting of the pipes. If needed, reposition the irrigation system components, such as sprinkler heads, to ensure optimal coverage and functionality. Following these steps should help to repair a leaking irrigation system effectively, ensuring that water is distributed efficiently and consistently throughout your desired area."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Born at Podolskaya Street in Saint Petersburg, Russia, Shostakovich was the second of three children of Dmitri Boleslavovich Shostakovich and Sofiya Vasilievna Kokoulina. Shostakovich's paternal grandfather, originally surnamed Szostakowicz, was of Polish Roman Catholic descent (his family roots trace to the region of the town of Vileyka in today's Belarus), but his immediate forebears came from Siberia. A Polish revolutionary in the January Uprising of 1863–4, Bolesław Szostakowicz would be exiled to Narym (near Tomsk) in 1866 in the crackdown that followed Dmitri Karakozov's assassination attempt on Tsar Alexander II. When his term of exile ended, Szostakowicz decided to remain in Siberia. He eventually became a successful banker in Irkutsk and raised a large family. His son Dmitri Boleslavovich Shostakovich, the composer's father, was born in exile in Narim in 1875 and studied physics and mathematics in Saint Petersburg University, graduating in 1899. He then went to work as an engineer under Dmitri Mendeleev at the Bureau of Weights and Measures in Saint Petersburg. In 1903 he married another Siberian transplant to the capital, Sofiya Vasilievna Kokoulina, one of six children born to a Russian Siberian native.Their son, Dmitri Dmitriyevich Shostakovich, displayed significant musical talent after he began piano lessons with his mother at the age of nine. On several occasions he displayed a remarkable ability to remember what his mother had played at the previous lesson, and would get \\"caught in the act\\" of playing the previous lesson's music while pretending to read different music placed in front of him. In 1918 he wrote a funeral march in memory of two leaders of the Kadet party, murdered by Bolshevik sailors.In 1919, at the age of 13, he was admitted to the Petrograd Conservatory, then headed by Alexander Glazunov, who monitored Shostakovich's progress closely and promoted him.
