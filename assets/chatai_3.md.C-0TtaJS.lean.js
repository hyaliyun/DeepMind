Article: The playwright George Bernard Shaw once said humorously, \\"England and America are two nations divided by a common language. If he were writing today, he might add 'divided by a common technology--- e-mail'\\". Two completely different styles of e-mail have formed on either side of the Atlantic-Euromail and Amerimail. Americail is informal and chatty. It's likely to begin with a \\"Hi\\" and end with a \\"Bye\\". The chances of Amerimail containing a smiley face or an \\"xoxo\\" are disturbingly high. We Americans are unwilling to dive into the meat of an e-mail. We feel we have to first inform recipients   about our vacation on the island which was really excellent except the jellyfish were biting and the kids caught a cold, so we had to skip the whale watching trip, then about that investors ' meeting in New York. Amerimail is a bundle of contradictions, casual and yet direct, respectful yet over proud. In other words, Amerimail is America. Euromail is stiff and cold often beginning with a formal \\"Dear Mr. X\\" and ending with a simple \\"Sincerely\\". You won't find any mention of kids or the weather or jellyfish in Euromail. It's all business. It's also slow. Your correspondent might take days even weeks to answer a message. Euromail is exactly like the Europeans themselves. Recently about 100 managers were asked on both sides of the Atlantic whether they noticed differences in e-mail styles. Most said yes. Here are a few of their observations: \\"Americans tend to write (e-mail) exactly as they speak.\\" \\"Why don't you just call me instead of writing five e-mails back and forth?\\" \\"Europeans are less interested in checking e-mail\\". \\"In general, Americans are much more responsive to e-mail--they respond faster and provide more information.\\" So which is better, Euromail or Amerimail? I realized it's not popular these days to suggest we have anything to learn from Europeans, but I'm fed up with an inbox filled with casual, barely meaningful e-mails from friends and colleagues. If the alternative is a few earnestly written, carefully... Question: What are characteristics of Amerimail? Yes or no, is the answer \\"Informal and chatty\\"? A:","output":"Yes, the answer is \\"Informal and chatty\\". Amerimail, which represents the American style of e-mail communication, is indeed characterized by its informal and chatty nature. It typically begins with a friendly \\"Hi\\" and ends with a casual \\"Bye.\\" It is not uncommon for Amerimail to contain emojis, such as smiley faces or \\"xoxo.\\" In addition to its informality, Amerimail often includes personal anecdotes or stories before getting into the main subject of the e-mail. This can include updates about vacations, family life, or other personal matters, as Americans hesitate to jump straight into the main topic without sharing these details. While being informal, Amerimail can be considered direct in the sense that it gets to the point, even though it may be buried under personal information. At the same time, it can also be seen as respectful by fostering a more personal connection with the recipient and demonstrating a willingness to share personal experiences. In a nutshell, Amerimail embodies the American culture with its blend of casualness and directness, demonstrating a mix of informality, openness, and friendliness in e-mail communication."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: A second-rate boarding school is run by the tyrannical and mean Michel Delassalle (Meurisse). The school is owned, though, by Delassalle's teacher wife, the frail Christina (Clouzot). Delassalle also has a relationship with Nicole Horner (Signoret), another teacher at the school. Rather than antagonism, the two women are shown to have a somewhat close relationship, primarily based on their apparent mutual hatred of Michel, who is physically and emotionally abusive to both, as well as unkind to the children. Unable to stand his mistreatment any longer, Nicole devises a plan to get rid of Michel forever. Though hesitant at first, Christina ultimately consents to help Nicole. Using a threatened divorce to lure Michel to Nicole's apartment building in a remote village several hundred kilometers away, Christina sedates him. The two women then drown him in a bathtub and dump his body in the school's neglected swimming pool. When his corpse floats to the surface, they think it will appear to have been an accident. Almost everything goes according to their plans until the body fails to surface. Michel's corpse is nowhere to be found when the pool is drained. Nicole sees in the paper that the police have found the corpse. However, when Christina goes to the morgue, she learns it is not actually Michel's body. There she meets Alfred Fichet (Vanel), a retired private detective. He becomes involved in the case, much to Nicole's chagrin. When Christina and Alfred come back, a boy is punished for breaking a window; the boy says it was Michel who punished him. After hearing this, Christina becomes very sick and is unable to be photographed for the school photo. However, it appears that Michel appears in the photo standing in the back next to a window. Nicole becomes worried and leaves the school. Christina, overcome by fear, tells Alfred everything. He does not believe her, but he investigates the pool.

Question: I can use this background: A firm with high fixed costs requires a large number of customers in order to have a meaningful return on investment. This is where economies of scale become important. Since each firm has large initial costs, as the firm gains market share and increases its output the fixed cost (what they initially invested) is divided among a larger number of customers. Therefore, in industries with large initial investment requirements, average total cost declines as output increases over a much larger range of output levels.  Now, I have a new situation: City D's mayor wants to invite more businesses in the city. Three firms, firm A, firm B, and firm C, took advantage of this opportunity. Firm A does not require large initial costs, but firm B and firm C require  large initial costs. Firm B managed to increase its market share, but firm C failed to increase its market share.  Answer this question please: Which frim's average total cost would decline, firm B or firm C? Answer:","output":"Based on the provided background information and the situation in City D, Firm B's average total cost would decline. The primary reason for this conclusion is the concept of economies of scale, which come into play when a firm with high fixed costs – such as Firm B and Firm C – gains a larger market share and increases its output. As more customers are acquired and output grows, these firms can spread their large initial investment over a greater number of customers, thus reducing the average total cost. Since Firm A does not require a large initial cost, it cannot take advantage of economies of scale in the same way as Firm B and Firm C. Therefore, discussing its average total costs would not be relevant to the question. In the case of Firm B and Firm C, both have high fixed costs due to their large initial investments. However, only Firm B managed to increase its market share, while Firm C failed to do so. As a result, Firm B can leverage its increased market share to spread its fixed cost over a larger customer base, which leads to a reduction in its average total cost. On the other hand, Firm C's failure to increase its market share means that it cannot distribute its initial investment as widely among customers. This implies that its average total cost would not decline as significantly, or may even stay high, due to its inability to achieve economies of scale. In conclusion, taking the background information and the specific situation in City D into account, Firm B's average total cost is the one that would decline, as it successfully increased its market share and output, allowing it to benefit from the economies of scale. In comparison, Firm C failed to achieve the same market growth, which would prevent its average total cost from declining."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Please answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person whose work fell from favor during his later years? , can you please find it?   Caspar David Friedrich (5 September 1774 – 7 May 1840) was a 19th-century German Romantic landscape painter, generally considered the most important German artist of his generation. He is best known for his mid-period allegorical landscapes which typically feature contemplative figures silhouetted against night skies, morning mists, barren trees or Gothic or megalithic ruins. His primary interest as an artist was the contemplation of nature, and his often symbolic and anti-classical work seeks to convey a subjective, emotional response to the natural world. Friedrich's paintings characteristically set a human presence in diminished perspective amid expansive landscapes, reducing the figures to a scale that, according to the art historian Christopher John Murray, directs \\"the viewer's gaze towards their metaphysical dimension\\".Friedrich was born in the town of Greifswald on the Baltic Sea in what was at the time Swedish Pomerania. He studied in Copenhagen until 1798, before settling in Dresden. He came of age during a period when, across Europe, a growing disillusionment with materialistic society was giving rise to a new appreciation of spirituality. This shift in ideals was often expressed through a reevaluation of the natural world, as artists such as Friedrich, J. M. W. Turner and John Constable sought to depict nature as a \\"divine creation, to be set against the artifice of human civilization\\".Friedrich's work brought him renown early in his career, and contemporaries such as the French sculptor David d'Angers spoke of him as a man who had discovered \\"the tragedy of landscape\\". Nevertheless, his work fell from favour during his later years, and he died in obscurity. As Germany moved towards modernisation in the late 19th century, a new sense of urgency characterised its art, and Friedrich's contemplative depictions of stillness came to be seen as the products of a bygone age. The early 20th century brought a renewed appreciation of his work, beginning in 1906 with an exhibition of thirty-two of his...

Write a title for this article: Michael Mace at Rubicon Consulting, a small research firm based in Los Gatos, Calif., has done anybody interested in the iPhone two favors: 1) He published a first-rate piece of research on the impact of the device on its owners and Apple’s APPL competitors, and 2) He has made his results easily — and freely — available on the Web. The key findings — based on interviews with 460 randomly selected iPhone users in the United States — are summarized in a dozen Quick Facts and ten Implications, both available here. Some of the bullet points: The full 35-page white paper — with color charts — can be downloaded as a PDF from the same Rubicon site. It’s easy reading and worth your time. For those of you who don’t make it all the way to the white paper, three charts struck me as particularly useful. The first is a bar chart showing what people do with their iPhones — daily, occasionally or never. Checking e-mail jumps out as the No. 1 thing most do every day, but it’s interesting how many fewer actually compose e-mail on the device. And it’s also interesting to see what most iPhone users never or rarely do with the device — like buy music, watch videos or read maps. One function we wish had been included in the first chart — use the iPhone to make and receive phone calls — is explored in the pie chart below. It turns out, one out of three iPhone owners carry around two phones. The RIM RIMM BlackBerry is the most popular second phone — used by nearly one in ten iPhone owners. Mace speculates that that will probably change when the iPhone gets Exchange support. But we wonder how many iPhone owners keep a simple, cheap cell phone with them either because they’re running out their contract with their original carrier or because it just works better as a phone. The third chart is the one that shows whose ox got gored when Apple entered the smartphone market. The big loser was Motorola MOT ; nearly a quarter of iPhone owners traded up from a Razr. Another big slice comes from RIM, but Mace believes that it’s Microsoft MSFT — squeezed between Apple and GOOG — that faces the biggest challenge down the road. More on that below the chart. Here’s why Mace believes Microsoft faces “severe challenges” in the smartphone market: Microsoft’s Windows Mobile is sandwiched between two big competitors, Google and Apple. Apple is crafting hardware-software systems that deliver a great user experience, while Google is giving away an operating system to the very companies that license Windows Mobile today. It’s possible for Microsoft to try to compete on both fronts, but creating a proprietary device and at the same time selling an operating system to others is extraordinarily difficult (Palm tried to do it and ended up splitting the company in two). We think Microsoft should probably decide whether it wants to compete in devices (in which case it will need to create its own phones, as it did for music players with the Zune) or compete in operating systems (in which case it will probably have to give away Windows Mobile for free). Both alternatives are very high-risk, and require business models that are outside Microsoft’s core competencies. The company’s recent purchase of Danger, which designed the TMobile Sidekick, may indicate that it intends to go the device route.

Fifteen years ago, a cruise named Yashiromaru, built by the Yashiro group, sank while sailing. In the present, a new cruise, the Saint Aphrodite, was built by the Yashiro group and Conan and the rest were invited through Sonoko. Earlier, the husband of the CEO of the Yashiro family group, an established ship architect, had a heart-attack and drove his car down a cliff. On the second day of the cruise, the CEO herself was found murdered in her room. Later, her father, the President of the Yashiro group was also found missing.

Kusaka, a scriptwriter who worked in co-operation with Akiyoshi on a script, was the culprit. Kusaka reveals that the accident from 15 years ago was a scheme to sink the ship deliberately to get insurance.

Premise: Every time I saw an Istanbul girl with a silk scarf pinching her head and reducing her face, I would think, heavens, take it off, let me show you how to wear it becomingly with your nice suit--and then I would remember that, above the shoulders, unattractiveness is the whole point. Hypothesis: I never thought about telling the girls to take their scarves off. Step 1: Identify the key points in the premise. - The person sees Istanbul girls with silk scarves pinching their heads. - The person thinks about telling the girls to take off their scarves and wear them in a more becoming way. - The person realizes that the unattractiveness of the scarf above the shoulders is intentional. Step 2: Analyze the hypothesis. - The person claims to have never thought about telling the girls to take their scarves off. Step 3: Compare the key points in the premise with the hypothesis. - The premise mentions that the person thinks about telling the girls to take off their scarves, but then realizes that the unattractiveness is intentional. Step 4: Determine the validity of the conclusion. - The hypothesis contradicts the premise, as it claims that the person never thought about telling the girls to take their scarves off, while the premise states that they did think about it before realizing the unattractiveness is intentional. Conclusion: It is not possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis, because the two statements contradict each other.

News article: Toyota Says No Full Production Until Yearâs End The time frame was the longest yet described by a Japanese car company in assessing the continued effects of the supply chain disruptions caused by last month’s destructive quake and tsunami. Though Toyota’s 17 plants in Japan escaped the disaster relatively unscathed, factory lines are working at only half volume here and at 40 percent overseas, as vital suppliers in Japan’s worst-hit areas struggle to restart operations. Toyota had indicated this week that its Japanese operations would remain at half-speed through at least June 3, but was unwilling to speculate beyond that. And it had said on Tuesday that it would cut production at its North American plants by 75 percent in the next six weeks to conserve its limited supply of parts made in Japan. The two other main Japanese automakers, Nissan and Honda, are also operating at only about half of normal production volumes in Japan. At a briefing for reporters here on Friday, Akio Toyoda, president and chief executive of Toyota, said he expected to ramp up production gradually in Japan, starting in July, as more parts makers came back on line. Toyota will raise production at its overseas plants a month later, in August, to allow for the parts to arrive from Japan, Mr. Toyoda said. Production at home and overseas will return to predisaster levels at all factory lines and across all vehicle models by November or December, Mr. Toyoda said. “The damage has been so widespread in this unprecedented calamity that its economic effect is being felt throughout Japan and in every industry,” Mr. Toyoda said. He added that the automaker had dispatched employees to help recovery work at some of its most vital parts makers. The severe disruptions come as a painful blow to Toyota just as it had appeared set to shake off the effects of a sharp slowdown in sales after the global economic crisis, as well as its handling of a spate of recalls. The reduced production also highlights a downside to Toyota’s insistence on making almost half of its cars in Japan and shipping them overseas. Also, its celebrated just-in-time production system, which reduces parts inventories to a minimum, may have made the disruptions worse. The automaker estimates that it faces shortages of about 150 critical parts, down from about 500 immediately after the March 11 quake. Atsushi Niimi, executive vice president in charge of production, said that Toyota had switched suppliers in some cases to speed the recovery. He said it had been a bitter revelation to Toyota that its cars, even those produced overseas, still relied so heavily on Japanese parts. “We need to procure more parts overseas, and we also urge our suppliers to make more forays outside Japan,” Mr. Niimi said. He added that Toyota would diversify its supplier base over all to make its supply chain more resilient. “It’s something we don’t want to think about, “ he said, “but it is something we cannot avoid if we are to continue to do business in a quake-prone country.” Mr. Toyoda, the company chief, said continuing aftershocks made the outlook uncertain. He declined to comment on the effect of the disruptions on the company’s earnings. “We just had an aftershock yesterday,” he said. “As these continue, the rapid recovery we’ve seen can come undone. The future is impossible to predict.” Another concern is the severe energy shortage brought by the crisis at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power station, 140 miles north of Tokyo, as well as damage to other power plants in the region. To avert a power supply collapse, the Japanese government initially instructed companies to reduce their energy use by as much as 25 percent. But frantic efforts by utilities to increase power generation at plants outside the worst-hit zones, as well as a public drive to conserve energy, has eased the energy shortfall, allowing the government to lower its directive to 15 percent. Mr. Niimi, the executive vice president for production, said that Toyota was discussing energy-saving measures with other automakers, like shutting production lines during the week and running them on weekends, when more electricity is available. Still, Mr. Toyoda said, the company was committed to keeping production — and jobs — in Japan. “Above all, we all love Japan,” he said. “As we face a national crisis, each company must do its part.” What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"The most important parts of this news article are: 1. Due to the supply chain disruptions caused by the earthquake and tsunami in Japan, Toyota announced that it would not achieve full production until the end of the year.

It is believed to have been written during the Warring States period (475 BC221 BC), and it achieved its final form during the mid-Han dynasty (206 BC220 AD). By the early Han dynasty the \\"Analects\\" was considered merely a \\"commentary\\" on the Five Classics, but the status of the \\"Analects\\" grew to be one of the central texts of Confucianism by the end of that dynasty.   - The years of \\"Genroku\\" are generally considered to be the Golden Age of the Edo period. The previous hundred years of peace and seclusion in Japan had created relative economic stability. The arts and architecture flourished. There were unanticipated consequences when the shogunate debased the quality of coins as a strategy for financing the appearance of continuing \\"Genroku\\" affluence. This strategic miscalculation caused abrupt inflation. Then, in an effort to solve the ensuing crisis, the \\"bakufu\\" introduced what were called the Kyh Reforms.  - The Actors' Analects (, \\"Yakusha Rongo\\") is a collection of 17th and early 18th century writings on the practice and aesthetics of acting in Japan's kabuki theatre form, compiled during or around the Genroku era (1688-1704). Though not providing much direct information about the origins or history of the development of kabuki in prior periods, the works collected were written at a time when many of the standards of kabuki were being established and formalized; the work thus reflects the philosophies and aesthetics of one of kabuki's most formative periods. One of the earliest extant versions was originally published in 1776, as a set of woodblock printed books in four volumes. It is unclear whether the Analects were printed as a collection before this time, but references to the \\"seven writings\\" indicate that the works were considered together as a group, even if they were not published in such a fashion, since their creation in the early 18th century.  - Yoshizawa Ayame I (    ) ( 1673 - 15 July 1729 ) was an early Kabuki actor , and the most celebrated onnagata ( specialist in female roles ) of his time .

A.C. Scott wrote that \`\` Yoshizawa Ayame I was regarded as the greatest onnagata or female impersonator of his time and was an artist of ability , who developed the unique technique which was to be a model for the actors of the future . His ideas and secrets were written down in a book called ' Ayamegusa ' , which was afterwards regarded as the Bible of the female impersonator . '' Ayame is famous for advocating that onnagata behave as women in all their interactions , both onstage and off . In Ayamegusa , he is quoted as saying that \`\` if ( an actor ) does not live his normal life as if he was a woman , it will not be possible for him to be called a skillful onnagata . '' Following his own advice , Ayame cultivated his femininity throughout his offstage life , and was often treated as a woman by his fellow actors .

Given the question: What is the answer for the question: What is the name of the person that had their contents auctioned on 6 May 1850? from the following article ?  Etty had planned for a burial in York Minster, but neglected to cover the necessary costs in his will. With Yorkshire local government in political and financial chaos in the wake of the bankruptcy of George Hudson, there was no political will to organise a public subscription or to waive the fees, and as a consequence Etty was buried in the churchyard of St Olave's Church, his local parish church. On 6 May 1850 the contents of his studio were auctioned, in a total of 1034 lots including around 900 paintings; some of these paintings were incomplete studies later completed by other artists to increase their value. In the years following his death Etty's work became highly collectable, his works fetching huge sums on resale. He continued to be regarded as a pornographer by some, with Charles Robert Leslie observing in 1850 \\"It cannot be doubted that the voluptuous treatment of his subjects, in very many instances, recommended them more powerfully than their admirable art; while we may fully believe that he himself, thinking and meaning no evil, was not aware of the manner in which his works were regarded by grosser minds\\".Six months after William's death, Betsy Etty married chemist Stephen Binnington, a distant relation of the Etty family. She moved into his house in Haymarket, and some time after his death moved to 40 Edwardes Square, where she died in 1888 at the age of 87. While Etty did have admirers, the patchy quality of his later work meant that he never acquired the circle of imitators and students that could have led to him being seen as the founder of the English realist movement, now considered to have begun in 1848 with the formation of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. William Holman Hunt and John Everett Millais, two of the three founders of the Pre-Raphaelites, were heavily influenced by Etty's early works but recoiled from his later style. Holman Hunt recollected that \\"in my youth [Etty] had lost the robustness he once had [...] the paintings of his advanced age cloyed the taste by their...

Write the answer: What word is used by Christians for the suffering and death of Jesus?","output":"The word used by Christians for the suffering and death of Jesus Christ is \\"Passion.\\" The term traces its etymology back to the Latin word \\"passio,\\" which means \\"suffering\\" or \\"enduring.\\" In the context of the life of Jesus, the Passion specifically refers to the events and episodes leading up to and including His crucifixion. To provide a comprehensive understanding of the Passion, it is essential to outline the key events narrated in the four Gospels–Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John–which chronicle Jesus' final moments. Although the Gospels differ in some details and emphasis, they collectively present a poignant portrayal of the Passion of Jesus Christ. 1. The Last Supper: Before the suffering and crucifixion, Jesus shared a final meal with His disciples, now known as the Last Supper. This gathering is significant in Christianity as it is when Jesus instituted the sacrament of the Holy Eucharist, symbolized by the breaking of bread and sharing of wine, which represent His body and blood. 2. The Agony in the Garden: After the Last Supper, Jesus went to the Garden of Gethsemane to pray. He was in deep distress, aware of the impending betrayal and the suffering to come. During this time, Jesus prayed to God, asking for strength to endure the painful ordeal. 3. The Betrayal by Judas and Arrest: One of Jesus' disciples, Judas Iscariot, had agreed to betray Jesus for thirty pieces of silver. Led by temple guards and Roman soldiers, Judas identified Jesus with a traitorous kiss, leading to His arrest. 4. The Trials: Jesus was subjected to a series of trials that started with a preliminary hearing before the Sanhedrin (the Jewish supreme council) and the high priest. He was then presented to Pontius Pilate, the Roman governor of Judea. Pilate initially found no guilt in Jesus and sent Him to Herod Antipas, ruler of Galilee. Unsuccessful in eliciting a confession, Antipas subsequently returned Jesus to Pilate, who eventually yielded to the crowd's demand to crucify Jesus in place of the criminal Barabbas. 5. The Scourging and Crowning with Thorns: Before crucifixion, Jesus was brutally beaten and scourged by Roman soldiers in an act of severe physical torture. In a cruel mockery of His claim to be the \\"King of the Jews,\\" the soldiers adorned Jesus with a purple robe and a crown made of thorns, causing unbearable pain and humiliation. 6. The Crucifixion and Death: Carrying the heavy wooden cross, Jesus was led to Golgotha (also known as the Place of the Skull) to be nailed to the cross alongside two criminals. Jesus endured unimaginable pain and suffering on the cross for several hours before He ultimately surrendered His spirit to God and passed away. 7. The Burial: After His death, Jesus' body was taken down from the cross, wrapped in a burial shroud, and placed in a tomb donated by a wealthy follower, Joseph of Arimathea. The Passion is central to Christian belief because it exemplifies Jesus' ultimate act of self-sacrifice for the spiritual redemption of humanity. This event, along with Jesus' subsequent resurrection, forms the basis of Christian faith and salvation. The Passion is observed and commemorated by Christians around the world, particularly during Holy Week–the final week of Lent–culminating in the solemn observance of Good Friday, the day on which Jesus was crucified."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Horse measuring sticks can be found at equestrian supply stores (tack shops), farm supply stores and from various online retailers.","output":"Step 1: Approach the horse calmly. Before starting the measurement, it's necessary to approach the horse in a calm and non-threatening manner. This helps ensure the horse remains calm and cooperative during the measurement process. Step 2: Position the horse on a flat, level surface. To obtain an accurate measurement, the horse should be standing on a flat and level surface. Make sure all four hooves are on the ground and the horse is standing upright with its head in a natural position. Step 3: Locate the horse's withers. The withers is the ridge between the horse's shoulder blades. This is the point where the height of a horse is traditionally measured. Step 4: Place the measuring stick or tape against the horse. If using a horse measuring stick, position it vertically next to the withers, making sure the stick is perpendicular to the ground. If using a measuring tape, hold one end on the ground and extend the tape vertically, keeping it parallel with the horse's withers. Step 5: Take the measurement. Slide the leveling arm or marker on the measuring stick down to rest on the withers. If using a measuring tape, manually hold the tape in place at the highest point of the withers. Record the measurement in hand units, where one hand is equal to four inches (10 cm). Most measuring sticks will have hand units marked on them. If using a measuring tape, divide the total inches by four to convert to hands. Step 6: Double-check the measurement. To ensure the accuracy of the measurement, repeat the process at least once more. Compare the two measurements and make sure they are consistent. Step 7: Record the horse's height. Document the horse's height in hands and inches (or centimeters) for future reference, either in a logbook or in your preferred digital format. By following these steps, you can accurately measure the height of a horse using a horse measuring stick or a standard measuring tape."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer choices: - Lift  - kinetic  - weight  - motion  - speed  - direction  - color  - muscles Answer:","output":"Pushing and pulling an object primarily affects its speed, but it can also impact other aspects, such as direction and motion. In order to provide a detailed response, let's first break down the effects of pushing and pulling on an object's different properties. 1. Lift: Lift is a force that acts on an object in the upward direction, usually associated with the force an airfoil generates as it moves through the air. Pushing and pulling on an object typically occurs along the horizontal plane, so it doesn't directly influence the lift that the object experiences. 2. Kinetic: Kinetic refers to the energy an object possesses due to its motion. When you push and pull on an object, you are transferring energy, which causes the object to accelerate or decelerate. In other words, pushing and pulling an object can increase or decrease its kinetic energy, depending on the direction and force applied. 3. Weight: Weight is a force due to gravity acting on an object's mass. Pushing and pulling do not have a direct impact on the weight of an object, as they don't change its mass or the gravitational force acting upon it. 4. Motion: Motion is the process of an object moving or changing its position. When you push or pull an object, you are creating motion by causing it to move. Therefore, pushing and pulling an object will influence its motion. 5. Speed: Speed is a scalar quantity that describes the rate of motion, or how fast an object is moving. Pushing and pulling an object can directly increase or decrease its speed, depending on the direction and magnitude of the force applied. 6. Direction: Direction is a vector quantity that indicates the orientation of an object's motion. When you push or pull an object, the force can change its direction, provided that the force is applied at an angle to the object's initial direction. 7. Color: Color is a property of an object that depends on the wavelengths of light it reflects, absorbs, or transmits. Pushing and pulling an object do not affect its color, as these actions have no impact on its physical or chemical properties related to light interaction. 8. Muscles: The term \\"muscles\\" is not applicable to objects, as it refers to the contractile tissues in animals responsible for producing motion. Therefore, pushing and pulling an object will not increase its \\"muscles.\\" To conclude, pushing and pulling an object can increase its speed, while also impacting its kinetic energy, motion, and direction. However, these actions do not have any direct effect on an object's lift, weight, color, or \\"muscles.\\""},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

An inmate walked out of a notorious open prison dubbed ‘Holiday Bay’ because he wanted to avoid the ‘temptation of illegal drugs’, a court heard. Graeme Shepherd, 41, browsed in a village post office and strolled around the village of Hollesley for three hours before being arrested in the grounds of a church. His barrister told a court he had taken ‘positive action’ to escape Hollesley Bay prison in the hope of being sent back to a closed jail, after an earlier formal request for a transfer had been turned down by the open jail. Graeme Shepherd fled Hollesley Bay jail (pictured) as he claimed he wanted to avoid the 'temptation of illegal drugs' Alan Wheetman, defending, said the request to be moved from the category D jail at Hollesley, near Woodbridge, Suffolk, was refused because Shepherd had refused to name prisoners involved in the supply of drugs. Mr Wheetman told Ipswich Crown Court on Tuesday: ‘He realised that in order to get away from Hollesley Bay he would have to take some positive action. 'He realised that anyone who escaped would be transferred back to closed conditions. ‘He has found it difficult in an open prison because of the temptation of illegal drugs. He says there is an awful lot of drugs in Hollesley Bay.’ Lee Chapman (pictured) previously claimed drugs were readily available at the prison as well as mobile phones. Mr Wheetman said Shepherd had been free of drugs since 2009 and had undergone regular voluntary testing in prison. Prosecutor Hugh Vass said Shepherd was found missing by a prison officer carrying out a morning roll call on December 11. Shepherd, who is serving an indefinite sentence for robbery, was located in the grounds of All Saints Church, Hollesley, by a policeman later that day. Mr Vass said: ‘He said he didn’t want to go back to drug taking and had done it for his own safety.’ Shepherd admitted escaping from lawful custody on December 11 and was ordered to serve an additional four months on top of his original sentence by Judge Rupert Overbury. Hollesley Bay prison has long been nicknamed Holiday Bay because of its relaxed atmosphere and sea views. A serving prisoner claimed in November last year that drugs and phones were easily available at the prison and that women had stayed overnight at the jail. The claims were made at Ipswich Crown Court by a barrister representing Lee Chapman, 34, before the defendant was sentenced for carrying out six burglaries while on the run from the jail - where he was serving a life sentence for arson with intent to endanger life, and burglary. Prison bosses strenuously denied the claim that women were permitted to sleep at the jail and said the possession of drugs or phones by inmates was treated as a criminal offence. Another inmate William Barlow, 30, who also went on the run because he did not like the jail’s ‘lax attitude’ to drugs was jailed for four weeks last October. Ipswich Crown Court heard how the defendant wanted to escape the jail as he is trying not to take illegal drugs. Ipswich Crown Court head how former drug user Barlow hoped to get caught and transferred to another prison even though he only had two weeks left to serve of a three and a half year sentence for burglary. He claimed he had to get away because other inmates were putting pressure on him to bring Class A drugs into the jail. In October, bank raider Kevin Smith, 29, went on the run from the prison just ten days after he had arrived. He had been transferred to the jail just two months into a five year term for conspiracy to commit burglary and conspiracy to steal a motor vehicle.

We want to find the value of 'a' that makes the equation true. The equation is: 0 = -77*a + 40*a - 185 1. First, we combine the 'a' terms: -77*a + 40*a = (-77 + 40) * a = -37*a So now, our equation looks like this: 0 = -37*a - 185 2. Now we want to isolate 'a', so we'll move 185 to the other side of the equation by adding 185 to both sides: 0 + 185 = -37*a 185 = -37*a 3. The last step is to divide by -37 to find the value of 'a': a = 185 / -37 And we find that a = -5.

Answer the following question given this paragraph:   The Golgi apparatus is a large organelle that is usually made up of five to eight cup-shaped, membrane-covered discs called cisternae, as shown in Figure above . The cisternae look a bit like a stack of deflated balloons. The Golgi apparatus modifies, sorts, and packages different substances for secretion out of the cell, or for use within the cell. The Golgi apparatus is found close to the nucleus of the cell, where it modifies proteins that have been delivered in transport vesicles from the RER. It is also involved in the transport of lipids around the cell. Pieces of the Golgi membrane pinch off to form vesicles that transport molecules around the cell. The Golgi apparatus can be thought of as similar to a post office; it packages and labels \\"items\\" and then sends them to different parts of the cell. Both plant and animal cells have a Golgi apparatus. Plant cells can have up to several hundred Golgi stacks scattered throughout the cytoplasm.

To provide a more detailed and long response, including the key information, the answer could be restructured as follows: The name of William Paley's book that claims divine beneficial design is \\"Natural Theology, or Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity, Collected from the Appearances of Nature,\\" often referred to simply as \\"Natural Theology.\\" Published in 1802, the book presents a comprehensive argument for the existence of God based on the evidence of order, purpose, and design visible in the natural world. Paley's ideas were influential in British natural philosophy and theology of his time. In \\"Natural Theology,\\" Paley employs a teleological argument, which means that he argues from the design or purpose in nature to the existence of a Designer, who is God. The book is famous for its \\"watchmaker analogy,\\" where Paley suggests that just as a watch, with its intricate and purposeful mechanism, implies the existence of an intelligent watchmaker, the complex structures and processes observed in the natural world imply the existence of a divine Creator. Paley's work considers multiple examples of intricate mechanisms in nature, such as the structure of the eye, as evidence for the notion of divine design. He believed that adaptation in living organisms could be explained by the Creator acting through natural laws, specifically designing each species with a particular purpose and function within the natural order. This way of thinking was later challenged by Charles Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection, which proposed that adaptation and the appearance of design in nature could be a result of natural processes rather than a conscious Designer. In conclusion, the book in question is \\"Natural Theology\\" by William Paley, which advocates for the existence of a divine Creator responsible for the beneficial design observed in nature.

Sprayers usually come with different nozzles depending on which part of the fence you're painting, so choose the correct nozzle to begin.  Unless you're only painting a small portion of the fence, choose the largest nozzle first. As you continue painting and need to get into cracks and crevices, use smaller, more precise nozzles as needed. Remember to use an oil-based fence that is safe for wood and exterior use and choose a day that is not very windy. Use horizontal strokes for horizontal panels and vertical strokes for vertical ones. Allow the primer to dry before proceeding. Drying times vary, so refer to the instructions on the can of primer for precise drying times. Keep your nozzle about six to eight inches away from the fence. Use a steady back and forth motion to spray your fence. For horizontal panels, move up and down. For verticals ones, move back and forth.  After spraying down one panel, go over your work at a perpendicular line of about 90 degrees. This leaves a crisscross pattern on your fence that eliminates streaks. Make sure not to make arcs at the ends of each stroke. This will spray paint in unwanted places. After your paint dries, examine your fence. Decide whether or not a second coat is necessary. If you chose a quality paint, you can probably get by with a single coat. However, if your paint is a little thin, add an extra coat after the first 1 dries. Check your paint's instructions to see how long it takes to dry. Most paints need to dry overnight. What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"The article provides step-by-step instructions for using a paint sprayer to paint a fence.

Question: What position did Eziquiel Carrerra play for the Blue Jays? Passage 1:Nehru's foreign policy was the inspiration of the Non-Aligned Movement, of which India was a co-founder. Nehru maintained friendly relations with both the United States and the Soviet Union, and encouraged the People's Republic of China to join the global community of nations. In 1956, when the Suez Canal Company was seized by the Egyptian government, an international conference voted 18–4 to take action against Egypt. India was one of the four backers of Egypt, along with Indonesia, Sri Lanka, and the USSR. India had opposed the partition of Palestine and the 1956 invasion of the Sinai by Israel, the United Kingdom and France, but did not oppose the Chinese direct control over Tibet, and the suppression of a pro-democracy movement in Hungary by the Soviet Union. Although Nehru disavowed nuclear ambitions for India, Canada and France aided India in the development of nuclear power stations for electricity. India also negotiated an agreement in 1960 with Pakistan on the just use of the waters of seven rivers shared by the countries. Nehru had visited Pakistan in 1953, but owing to political turmoil in Pakistan, no headway was made on the Kashmir dispute.  Passage 2:It returned to racing in the 1961 season for the 12 Hours of Sebring, driven by Giancarlo Baghetti, Mairesse, Ginther and Wolfgang von Trips, finishing second overall behind teammates Phil Hill and Olivier Gendebien. At the Targa Florio it was team's sole front-engine entry, with Mairesse and Pedro Rodríguez driving. They retired after one of the drivers crashed during practice. 0780TR returned to the factory for repairs and modification of its nose to TRI/61 style. This was completed in time for the car to be run by the factory-supported North American Racing Team in the 1961 1000 km Nürburgring. Driven by Pedro Rodríguez and his younger brother Ricardo, the car finished second behind the Maserati Tipo 61 of Lloyd Casner and Masten Gregory. The Rodriguez brothers had to pit late in the race after destroying a front wheel, eliminating any chance of a win. The car then was entered by Scuderia Ferrari in the 1961 24 Hours of Le Mans, driven by Mairesse and Mike Parkes. After a poor start, they finished second, again behind Hill and Gendebien. They ran third for much of the race, achieving second when the Rodríguez brothers' 250 TRI61 retired with broken pistons with two hours to go. In the season-ending Pescara 4 Hours 0780TR was driven to victory by Scuderia Ferrari's Lorenzo Bandini and Giorgio Scarlatti, despite an oil leak that saw Bandini fall back to 27th. From this position, he regained second place with his rapid pace and won when the leading Camoradi Maserati Tipo 61 retired.  Passage 3:The Blue Jays opened the scoring in the third inning with five runs. Ezequiel Carrera walked with one out, moved to second on a wild pitch, then scored on Josh Donaldson's double. Back-to-back singles by Edwin Encarnacion and Jose Bautista made it 2–0. After Russell Martin walked to load the bases, Troy Tulowitzki cleared them with a triple. Rangers' starter Cole Hamels threw 42 pitches that inning, the most pitches in an inning he had ever thrown. Next inning, Melvin Upton Jr.'s leadoff home run made it 6–0. Rangers' shortstop Elvis Andrus's throwing error to first allowed Devon Travis to reach. He moved to second on a passed ball, then scored on Josh Donaldson's single to make it 7–0 and knock Hamels out of the game. The Rangers bullpen tossed 4 scoreless innings, but after back-to-back singles to lead off the ninth off Jake Diekman, Bautista hit a three-run home run amid boos from the Rangers crowd, giving the Blue Jays a 10–0 lead.

Please answer the following question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: An international consortium of scientists, operating as Project Inner Space in Tanganyika, Africa, is trying to tap into the Earth's geothermal energy by drilling a very deep hole down to the Earth's core. The scientists are foiled by an extremely dense layer of material at the boundary between the two. To penetrate the barrier and reach the magma below, they intend to detonate an atomic device at the bottom of the hole. The leader of the project, Dr. Stephen Sorenson (Dana Andrews), who is secretly dying of cancer, believes that the atomic device will burn its way through the barrier, but the project's chief geologist, Dr. Ted Rampion (Kieron Moore), is convinced that the lower layers of the crust have been weakened by decades of underground nuclear tests, and that the detonation could produce a massive crack that would threaten the very existence of Earth. The atomic device is used and Rampion's fears prove justified, as the crust of the Earth develops an enormous crack that progresses rapidly. Sorenson discovers that there was a huge reservoir of hydrogen underground, which turned the small conventional atomic explosion into a huge thermonuclear one that was millions of times more powerful. Another atomic device is used in the hope of stopping the crack, but it only reverses the crack's direction. Eventually the crack returns to its starting point at the test site, and a huge chunk of the planet outlined by the crack is expected to be thrown out into space. Sorenson remains at the underground control center to record the event despite pleas by his wife Maggie to evacuate with the rest of the project staff. She and Rampion barely escape in time to observe the fiery birth of a second moon. Its release stops the crack from further splitting the Earth.

Chief Blount captured Chief Hancock, and the settlers executed him in 1712. In 1713 the Southern Tuscarora lost their Fort Neoheroka, located in Greene County. About 950 people were killed or captured and sold into slavery in the Caribbean or New England by Colonel Moore and his South Carolina troops. His forces were made up of 33 white men and more than 900 Native American allies, mostly Yamasee and Cherokee, historic competitors to the Tuscarora. At this point, the majority of the surviving Southern Tuscarora began migrating to New York to escape the settlers in North Carolina. Their leader declared that those remaining in the South after 1722 were no longer members of the tribe. They joined the Five Nations of the Haudenosaunee or Iroquois Confederacy, and were accepted as the sixth nation. The remaining Tuscarora signed a treaty with the settlers in June 1718. It granted them a tract of land on the Roanoke River in what is now Bertie County. This was the area already occupied by Tom Blount, and was specified as 56,000 acres ; Tom Blount was recognized by the Legislature of North Carolina as King Tom Blount. The remaining Southern Tuscarora were removed from their homes on the Pamlico River and forced to Bertie. In 1722 the colony chartered Bertie County. Over the next several decades, the remaining Tuscarora lands continually diminished as the tribe sold off land in deals which speculators designed to take advantage of them.

Please answer the following question: I can use this background: Baker's yeast is the common name for the strains of yeast commonly used in baking bread and bakery products, serving as a leavening agent which causes the bread to rise (expand and become lighter and softer) by converting the fermentable sugars present in the dough into carbon dioxide and ethanol. Baker's yeast is of the species Saccharomyces cerevisiae,[1] and is the same species (but a different strain) as the kind commonly used in alcoholic fermentation, which is called brewer's yeast.[2] Baker's yeast is also a single-cell microorganism found on and around the human body.

Please answer the following question: I can use this background: Antifreeze could also be called “antiboil” because it also raises the boiling point of the water in a car radiator. Hot weather combined with a hot engine can easily raise the temperature of the water in the radiator above 100 °C, which is the boiling point of pure water. If the water boils, it could cause the engine to overheat and become seriously damaged. However, if antifreeze has been added to the water, the boiling point is much higher. For example a 50 percent antifreeze solution has a boiling point of 129 °C. Unless the water gets hotter than this, it won’t boil and ruin the engine.  Now, I have a new situation: Rob is an auto mechanic. He was checking the radiators of his car and truck. He put antifreeze into the car radiator, but didn't put any antifreeze into the truck radiator. He was wondering how the vehicles would fare in coming hot weather.  Answer this question please: Which vehicle would do worse in hot weather and hot engine, car or truck? A:","output":"The truck would do worse in hot weather and hot engine conditions, because Rob didn't put any antifreeze into the truck radiator. Without antifreeze, the boiling point of the water in the truck radiator would be lower (100 °C) compared to the car radiator that has antifreeze (boiling point of 129 °C with a 50 percent antifreeze solution).

Alyssa Elsman of Portage, Mich., was vacationing with family when she and her 13-year-old sister found themselves in the path of the speeding car driven onto a sidewalk by Richard Rojas, 26, who also injured 21 other pedestrians in the attack.      The siblings were struck just before noon as they walked along the sidewalk of Seventh Avenue, between West 42nd and 43rd streets, police officials said.      Elsman was pronounced dead at the scene. Her sister was taken to an area hospital, cops said.      Less than an hour before the horrific crash, Elsman had posted a video on Instagram showing her standing atop the red staircase above the TKTS booth in Duffy Square, where she had visited one year ago.      The sisters had been on vacation with their mother and one of Alyssa’s friends, Alyssa’s devastated boyfriend, Trevor West, told The Post.      West said he knew something was wrong when Elsman didn’t respond to a text message he had sent her.      “She would always text me back as quick as she could, and when I didn’t hear from her or her friend I knew something horrible happened,” West said.      “I knew something was wrong.”      West, who had started dating Elsman six months ago, said she was “everything” to him.      “She motivated me, loved me, gave me everything I needed that I couldn’t give myself. And now that she’s gone, I don’t know how I’m going to fill that void,” West said.      “I don’t know how I’m going to function without her ever again.”      Elsman had told him she was enjoying her trip to the Big Apple, West recalled. But she also said she had started feeling sick while walking around Thursday morning.      “She felt better in Times Square,” West said. “Then I didn’t hear from her.”      Rojas was bent on committing murder and wanted cops to kill him, police sources told The Post.      Of the 22 people injured in the crash, four were in critical condition as of Thursday night and three were in serious condition, authorities said.      Elsman attended Portage Central High School and worked as a “carhop,” or roller-skating server, at a Sonic Drive-In, according to her Facebook page.      She had been scheduled to return to Michigan on Tuesday.      A witness, El Marvin, recalled seeing a young woman apparently dead on the ground.      “I saw a girl, young . . . She was on the ground,” said Marvin, 38.      “Her forehead was busted. Blood everywhere. She was gone. A police officer took his handkerchief and put it over her face. He was crying.”      Another witness, Julio Sanchez River, 20, was delivering food in the area at the time and ducked inside a building when he saw Rojas’ car barreling toward him.      “There were clothes and shoes everywhere,” he said.      “I saw a bunch of people in the aftermath that got injured. It was a pretty scary sight. It was really gruesome.”      Meanwhile, Mayor Bill de Blasio visited victims’ families at Bellevue Hospital on Thursday afternoon.      “You are going to have to be strong now,” de Blasio was overheard telling relatives outside the pediatric ward.

(May 18) AP      Emergency workers work at the scene after multiple people were injured when a vehicle struck numerous pedestrians May 18, 2017, in Times Square in New York City. (Photo: GARY HE, EPA)      Staff and students at Portage Central High School are grieving the loss of a 2016 graduate who died today when a vehicle careened into a crowd in New York City's Times Square, killing the girl and injuring her sister and 21 others.      Alyssa Elsman, 18, was a kind, compassionate student known around the school for selling delicious muffins she baked in a cooking class, principal Eric Alburtus said.      \\"We're all kind of a mess,\\" he said late this afternoon as the community absorbed the shocking news.      Related:      A man who appeared to be intoxicated steered his car onto a sidewalk in Times Square around midday, killing Elsman and injuring 22 others including Alyssa's 13-year-old sister Ava. Ava attends Portage Central Middle School.      The driver, 26-year-old Richard Rojas, was tackled by pedestrians and taken into custody.      Alburtus was in a meeting when a news alert popped up on his phone about the crash. Later, about 2 p.m., he received calls from friends of the Elsman family who told him Alyssa had died.      \\"Alyssa was wonderful young lady,\\" he said. \\"When you first got to know her, you would perceive that she was shy or quiet. The more you got to know her, the more you would realize she was funny, and thoughtful, and compassionate to other people.\\"      Alburtus met with teachers this afternoon to tell them the news. The school is bringing in grief counselors Friday for students.      “Our deepest sympathies go out to the Elsman family,” Portage Public Schools Superintendent Mark Bielang said in a statement. “It is the most devastating kind of sad when a wonderful person in our community is lost so young, and under such heartbreaking circumstances.”      People from as far away as Belgium and Guatemala flooded Elsman's Facebook page with messages of condolence. The page says she worked as a carhop at a Sonic restaurant.      Portage resident Olivia Lemke, 18, said her family moved next door to the Elsmans on Calico Avenue in Portage about a decade ago.      She said the Elsmans, who no longer live next door, took an annual trip to New York City, and she guesses that’s why the sisters were in Times Square.      Lemke recalled meeting Elsman on the playground of nearby Lake Center Elementary School. They became fast friends, lasting through when both graduated from Portage Central High School last year.      “They were together a lot,” Olivia’s mother, Kristen Lemke, said. “If one wasn’t (at one house), the other was (at the other house). They spent a lot of time together.”      Olivia Lemke described Elsman as a “wallflower.” She said Elsman had a tight-knit friend group of about four people along with many friendly acquaintances.      “She was a good person and a family person,” Kristen Lemke said. “She took care of her brother and sister a lot and she was always there.”      “I went to her for everything — literally,” Olivia Lemke added. “She was honest.”      The Associated Press contributed to this report.

Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What is the last name of the band member that wrote all the lyrics on the album that went to number one in UK? from the following article ?  In 1982, Waters suggested a new musical project with the working title Spare Bricks, originally conceived as the soundtrack album for Pink Floyd – The Wall. With the onset of the Falklands War, Waters changed direction and began writing new material. He saw Margaret Thatcher's response to the invasion of the Falklands as jingoistic and unnecessary, and dedicated the album to his late father. Immediately arguments arose between Waters and Gilmour, who felt that the album should include all new material, rather than recycle songs passed over for The Wall. Waters felt that Gilmour had contributed little to the band's lyrical repertoire. Michael Kamen, a contributor to the orchestral arrangements of The Wall, mediated between the two, also performing the role traditionally occupied by the then-absent Wright. The tension within the band grew. Waters and Gilmour worked independently; however, Gilmour began to feel the strain, sometimes barely maintaining his composure. After a final confrontation, Gilmour's name disappeared from the credit list, reflecting what Waters felt was his lack of songwriting contributions.Though Mason's musical contributions were minimal, he stayed busy recording sound effects for an experimental Holophonic system to be used on the album. With marital problems of his own, he remained a distant figure. Pink Floyd did not use Thorgerson for the cover design, Waters choosing to design the cover himself. Released in March 1983, The Final Cut went straight to number one in the UK and number six in the US. Waters wrote all the lyrics, as well as all the music on the album. Gilmour did not have any material ready for the album and asked Waters to delay the recording until he could write some songs, but Waters refused. Gilmour later commented: \\"I'm certainly guilty at times of being lazy ... but he wasn't right about wanting to put some duff tracks on The Final Cut.\\" Rolling Stone magazine gave the album five stars, with Kurt Loder calling it \\"a superlative achievement ... art rock's crowning...

It connects Cheriton in Kent, England with Sangatte in northern France. It is the second longest rail tunnel in the world. Did you know that the British and the French had a race whi1e they were building the Chunnel? The race was to see who could get to the middle of the tunnel first. The British won by a little bit. It took 15,000 workers over seven years to dig the tunnel. The tunnel was finished in 1994. The completed Chunnel cost about  21 billion. But it all paid off, because it became very popular, very quick. Millions of people use it. Now it is getting even more popular. There are three complete tunnels in the Chunnel.

Summarize the following: Challenge yourself to talk to at least a couple new people every day. It can be tough to approach new people at school or work, especially if you’re naturally shy. Try to relax, remind yourself that everyone gets nervous, and take a step out of your comfort zone.  For example, instead of eating lunch alone, look for someone you’ve never met and say, “Hey there! Is this seat taken?” Later on, they’ll probably notice you when you pass them in the hallway and say hello. If you’re nervous, remember that everyone has insecurities and gets shy, even if they seem totally confident on the outside. When you meet someone or have a conversation, smile naturally and look them in the eye. Try not to fake a smile and, if you have to, think of something that cracks you up without fail. When making eye contact, don’t stare without blinking, but look at the person directly to show you’re paying attention to them. Whether you’re having lunch with someone new or at a work meeting, try to think of thoughtful questions that show you’re engaged in the moment. When the person responds, try to pay attention to them instead of just thinking of something interesting to say. For example, if you’re at a new school, ask the person sitting next to you, “What do you do for fun? Are you in any clubs or do you play a sport?” Instead of asking another unrelated question after they respond, say something like, “Oh cool! I’ve never played hockey, but it’s fun to watch. Do lots of people go to games and show school spirit?” Once they respond, try mentioning an activity that you are interested in to build the conversation. From your music taste to snowboarding, an interest or hobby can make you more noticeable. However, you don't want to just adopt the interests of your crush or a popular person to get them to notice you.  Figure out what you enjoy and do it. If you love a music genre, listen to as many tracks and artists as you can and learn about its evolution. Developing an interest or hobby can help you spark conversations and get noticed by like-minded people. If you already have an interesting hobby, you can use it to start conversations as well. Joining a club or sports team is another great way to meet new people and make deeper connections. Since everyone involved already has that activity in common, it can be a little easier to form relationships with your teammates.  Running for student government is another great way to get recognized by your peers.  If your workplace has a company team, join it or support it. For example, if there’s a company softball team but you’re not the best athlete, go to the game, cheer for your team, and bring a cooler with refreshments. Whether it’s a school dance or a company cocktail hour, do your best to attend social events. You have to put yourself out there if you want people to notice you. If you stay home, you could be passing up a good time or networking opportunity. If you’re an introvert, try to use it to your advantage at social events. Listen and observe while all the extroverts talk. Then, when the opportunity presents itself, you could say to someone, “I heard you mention Roald Dahl earlier. He’s my favorite author!” Whether the person is your crush or an executive at work, they’ll notice that you paid attention to them and sparked a meaningful conversation.","output":"So, it's important to talk to new people every day, even if you're shy. Try smiling, looking in their eyes, and asking questions about what they like to do for fun. Join clubs and teams to meet more friends, and go to social events so people can notice you. Remember, it's okay to be a little nervous because everyone feels that way sometimes. Just be yourself and try to have fun when talking to others!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Creating visual consistency: When elements are repeated within a design, it allows the viewer's eye to easily recognize and follow the pattern, making it more comprehensible and engaging. 2. Establishing a sense of unity: Repetition helps bring together separate components of a design, allowing them to function as a single coherent entity. This is particularly crucial in instances where various types of media and elements need to be integrated within a single design. 3. Enhancing brand identity: When a company consistently uses specific shapes and motifs, it helps to create a more recognizable identity. This can be seen in the Coca-Cola logo or Apple's distinct apple icon, which have become synonymous with their respective brands. 4. Adding visual interest: Repetition can also add interest and depth to a design when used creatively, especially if it comprises an intricate pattern or a dynamic arrangement of shapes. 5. Communicating hierarchy or emphasis: By repeating specific shapes or elements, a designer can draw attention to certain aspects of a design or create a sense of importance within the composition. 6. Encouraging rhythm and movement: The use of repetition and shapes in a design can also create a sense of rhythm, guiding the viewer's eye throughout the composition, highlighting key features, and creating a sense of flow. Overall, the use of repetition and a system of shapes is an essential concept that can elevate a design by making it more cohesive, balanced, and visually interesting. When applied effectively, this concept can contribute to enhanced communication, memorability, and aesthetic appeal in various design disciplines."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

White House Increases Overtime Eligibility by Millions Opponents argued that the measure could cost billions of dollars and would undermine the morale of salaried employees by requiring them to account for every hour of their workdays. “This is an extreme revision in the white-collar threshold,” said David French of the National Retail Federation. “By executive fiat, the Department of Labor is effectively demoting millions of workers.” Republican lawmakers, who are close to many of the industries that oppose the new rule, have vowed to block it during a mandated congressional review period. With Donald J. Trump as their presumptive presidential nominee, however, the issue is fraught with risk for Republicans. Any attempt to repeal the regulation could exacerbate an already palpable split between Mr. Trump’s blue-collar supporters and the party’s establishment donors and politicians. Paul Porter, a truck driver from Ava, Mo., who is a member of the Teamsters union and a supporter of Mr. Trump, said he already received time and a half after eight hours of work, but strongly favored the new overtime regulation. “I have friends who are managers who get taken advantage of terribly,” he said. The administration, for its part, expressed confidence it was holding the better political hand. “I welcome a debate in Congress about wages in this country,” Thomas E. Perez, the secretary of labor, said. “It crystallizes the difference between this president and the leadership in Congress.” Federal employment law provides two ways for most salaried workers to become eligible for overtime. The first is through a so-called duties test that essentially determines whether or not they are bona fide executives, administrators or professionals, which has historically meant spending most of their time exercising some decision-making authority. If not, they are supposed to be eligible for overtime pay. That method is open to interpretation. The second is more of a hard-and-fast standard, setting a salary level to determine eligibility for overtime, regardless of duties. So even for employees who are legitimately managers, if their salary is below the cutoff, they must be paid overtime. Certain categories of workers, like teachers, doctors and outside sales representatives, continue to be exempt from the regulation, though academics primarily engaged in research are not. The overtime rule dates back to the passage of the 1938 law that established a federal minimum wage. The cutoff has been raised several times over the years. In 2004, the Bush administration also made it easier to exempt workers above the cutoff under the duties test. Proponents like Mr. Eisenbrey urged the administration to raise the cutoff to about 51,000, which, in inflation-adjusted dollars, is roughly where it stood in 1975, when the Ford administration undertook the last major expansion of overtime eligibility. In addition to increasing the basic ceiling, which will be set to match the pay of full-time salaried workers earning at the 40th percentile of salaries in the country’s lowest-income region, currently the South, the new regulation will be updated every three years to keep pace with changes in pay. The Labor Department calculates that 4.2 million workers will become newly eligible for overtime. Other estimates put the number of newly eligible workers substantially higher. In addition, according to the department, nearly nine million more workers who should already be eligible for overtime under the current duties test will be protected against being denied overtime illegally. The most heated debate concerns the fate of those workers who are relatively far from the new cutoff. Critics argue that employers will simply lower the base wage for a majority of affected workers who work overtime, so that their overall pay, including overtime pay, will remain the same. A projection by the consulting firm Oxford Economics, prepared for the National Retail Federation, predicted that a “disproportionate number of workers” who became eligible for overtime and worked more than 40 hours would “see their hourly rates decreased by an equal amount, leaving their total annual earnings unchanged.” By contrast, Daniel Hamermesh, a labor economist at the Institute for the Study of Labor, predicted that base wages would fall somewhat over time, but that the higher overtime payments would more than offset any loss in regular salary levels. The regulation, which President Obama directed the Labor Department to work on in 2014 and which the department first proposed last July, provoked a deluge of comments from the public — nearly 300,000 in all. Many opponents argued that the new salary level would unfairly affect lower-wage regions of the country. The department decreased its proposed cutoff of 50,440 in response. It also changed its proposed annual indexing to once every three years, and decided against revisiting the 2004 changes to the duties test. Groups representing colleges and universities, local governments, and smaller nonprofits also expressed concerns about the cost of the new regulation. Elward Edd, an official at the Hopi Tribal Housing Authority in Arizona, which has a backlog of more than 500 homes to repair, said the burden of the new regulation would force him to scale back hiring to one construction crew from two. Mr. Edd said he was not certain the new regulation would apply to his tribe, but planned to follow it until obtaining clarity. Labor Department officials said it would not. Many critics argued that the need to closely monitor hours would impinge on workers’ freedom by preventing them from working as long as they like, and could damage an employee’s status and sense of self-worth. But at least some of the likely beneficiaries of the new overtime rule took issue with the prediction of looming morale problems. “That is so out of touch,” said Erin Clark, a postdoctoral fellow at Brandeis University who spends about 60 hours a week doing research on neurons and makes 46,344 after having earned a Ph.D. from Harvard. When the regulation goes into effect, Dr. Clark added, “it will at least feel like you’re out there in the job market with everyone else, on some sort of playing field, as opposed to this weird vestigial training position.” Julie Hirschfeld Davis contributed reporting.

Order Reprints| Today's Paper|Subscribe What was this article about?","output":"This article discusses the White House's decision to increase overtime eligibility for millions of workers in the United States. The Obama administration introduced a new rule that raises the salary threshold under which workers qualify for overtime pay from 23,660 to 47,476 annually. This move is expected to benefit around 4.2 million workers who were previously not eligible for overtime. Opponents of the measure argue that it could cost billions of dollars and negatively impact the morale of salaried employees by requiring them to account for every hour of their workdays. David French, from the National Retail Federation, states that the Department of Labor is effectively demoting millions of workers through this action. Republican lawmakers, many of whom have close ties to the industries opposing the new rule, have vowed to block it during the mandated congressional review period. The issue presents potential risks for the Republicans, as any attempt to repeal the regulation could worsen the ongoing split between Donald Trump's blue-collar supporters and the party’s establishment donors and politicians. The new rule updates a regulation dating back to 1938 that was intended to establish a federal minimum wage. The cutoff has been raised several times over the years, with the latest change aiming to match the pay of full-time salaried workers earning at the 40th percentile of salaries in the country’s lowest-income region. The regulation will also be updated every three years to reflect changes in pay. Proponents of the new rule believe it will protect workers who should already be eligible for overtime. However, critics argue that employers may lower base wages for affected workers who work overtime, resulting in no change in their overall pay. Despite these concerns, the rule is expected to benefit numerous workers by providing additional compensation for hours worked beyond the standard 40-hour workweek."},{"instruction":"The pawn was hand carved, it was a fine what? - scheme - elephant - chess game - north carolina - chess set  The best answer is Answer:","output":"chess set"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The audition was cancelled due to a myriad of contributing factors that ultimately led to the decision to suspend the production of the movie temporarily. Subsequently, this also meant that the original movie was cancelled, ushering in a period of uncertainty and disappointment for all those involved in the project. The primary reason for the cancellation of the audition was budgetary constraints. The production company faced financial challenges that prevented them from proceeding with the initial plans for the movie. Inadequate funding often puts a strain on the entire production process, right from pre-production, which involves conceptualizing, writing, and eventual casting. Consequently, the producers were left with little choice but to put a halt to the auditions. Moreover, the cancellation of the movie was brought on by a combination of issues involving the script and disagreements among the creative team. Revisions to the script were abundant and persistent, making it difficult to move forward with the casting process. The writers and director had differing visions for the narrative and character development, causing delays and tensions within the production team. Sadly, these unresolved disagreements led to the decision to cancel the project. Casting, which plays a crucial role in shaping the overall film, was another factor that contributed to the cancellation of the movie. It had been proving difficult to find suitable actors who could bring the desired depth and nuanced performances required for the various roles. The lack of progress in casting ultimately rendered the audition process redundant since the pool of talent was insufficient to populate the major roles. Competition within the film industry also contributed to the decision to cancel the movie. With several other productions in the pipeline targeting the same demographic or exploring similar themes, the production company grew increasingly wary of entering a saturated market. As a result, the producers began to reassess the viability of the project and eventually made the difficult decision to cancel the movie, consequently cancelling the auditions as well. Lastly, external circumstances such as the global COVID-19 pandemic have significantly impacted many industries, including film production. Adhering to safety mandates and ensuring the health and welfare of cast and crew members has led to many movie projects being postponed or cancelled altogether. In the case of this particular project, such unforeseen global events added to the aforementioned challenges and ultimately contributed to the cancellation of the movie and its associated audition. In conclusion, the planned audition for the new movie did not take place due to several factors that led to not only the cancellation of the audition but also the movie itself. Financial difficulties, creative disagreements, casting challenges, market competition, and unforeseen global events cumulatively forced the difficult decision to halt the production and disappoint the involved parties. The film industry is complex and ever-changing, and these setbacks serve to remind all those who work in it to persevere and adapt in the face of adversity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Doctor's office: While a doctor's office may have plants for decorative purposes, it is not a location specifically dedicated to the display or cultivation of rare or special plants like a unique ficus. 3. In a sea: A ficus is a terrestrial plant and not an aquatic one, so it would not typically be found in a sea. 4. Public place: A special ficus might occasionally be found in a public place, but such a location is not specifically dedicated to the display, cultivation, and preservation of rare or special plants as a botanical garden would be. 5. Arboretum: An arboretum is a garden dedicated to the cultivation and display of trees, and while a ficus species could potentially be found there, it is not as likely as in a botanical garden, which has an extensive collection of diverse plant species, including possibly unique ficus plants.

Getty Trump on Fiorina's face: I made those comments as an entertainer      Donald Trump didn’t mean any harm when he criticized fellow GOP 2016 presidential candidate Carly Fiorina’s face. He says he was just being the showman he is.      “Many of those comments are made as an entertainer because I did The Apprentice and it was one of the top shows on television,” he told Greta Van Susteren on Thursday night. “Some comments are made as an entertainer and as everybody said, as an entertainer is a much different ball game.”      Story Continued Below      Trump who is leading in Republican polls has said comments that would have buried many other candidates.      A Rolling Stone story Wednesday illustrates a scene where Trump watches Fiorina come onto the TV screen.      “’Look at that face!' he cries. 'Would anyone vote for that? Can you imagine that, the face of our next president?!' The laughter grows halting and faint behind him. 'I mean, she's a woman, and I'm not s'posed ta say bad things, but really, folks, come on. Are we serious?'”      On Thursday night, he reiterated what he told CNN earlier — that the face comments were actually about her persona.      “We’re really talking about not a physical thing, we’re talking about the persona. This is a women that gets tremendous publicity,” he said. “I don’t know why…her past doesn’t go along with the publicity she’s getting.”      But it didn’t take long before he was back on his favorite punching bag: Jeb Bush. “When somebody knocks me like Jeb Bush or anybody else, I at least decide that I think it’s appropriate to fight back.”      Van Susteren pointed out this wasn’t his first time saying controversial comments about women.      Trump responded that he was leading with women, and many other groups.      “I’d like to say that nobody understands and nobody wants to do more for women,” Trump said, a favorite line of his. “My wife was talking to me and she said you cherish women you really have to talk about it a little bit more.”      Trump also addressed his spat with Dr. Ben Carson. Earlier Thursday he said Carson, who is the first person to successfully separate twins conjoined at the back of the head, was an “OK doctor.”      Trump backtracked a bit, saying he’s sure some people will disagree with his views.      “I’m sure he’s a good doctor, I think that he’s overrated as a doctor,” Trump said.      CLARIFICATION: CLARIFICATION: This post has been updated to clarify the type of surgery Carson was first in successfully completing. ||||| AP Photo Jindal calls Trump practically every name in the book      Bobby Jindal pulled no punches against Donald Trump on Thursday, raining down a deluge of criticisms on the current Republican leader in the polls, calling him \\"a narcissist,\\" \\"an egomaniac,\\" \\"non-serious,\\" \\"substance-free,\\" \\"insecure,\\" \\"weak,\\" \\"shallow,\\" \\"unstable,\\" among other knocks.      \\"Donald Trump is for Donald Trump.

He skewered Trump's professed love for the Bible, a book the businessman has named as his favorite, far above his second favorite, his own \\"The Art of the Deal.\\"      \\"Donald Trump's never read the Bible,\\" Jindal charged. \\"The reason we know he's never read the Bible, he's not in the Bible.\\"      Trump's \\"summer of silliness\\" must end, Jindal said, while acknowledging that he did find it humorous that Trump gave out fellow candidate Lindsey Graham's cellphone number, for example.      \\"He's a carnival act,\\" said Jindal, whose campaign also released a new video Thursday that compared Trump's campaign antics to those of \\"winning\\" actor Charlie Sheen in 2011.      Trump responded later in the day, remarking that Jindal \\"did not make the debate stage and therefore I have never met him.\\"      \\"I only respond to people that register more than 1 percent in the polls.

Having lots of enjoyable sex may put them at a greater risk for heart complications. The study, published in the Journal of Health and Social Behavior, looked at 2,204 people between the ages 57 to 85. The people were interviewed again five years later, in an effort to understand how sex impacts people’s health later in life. The report authors found that men who reported having at least weekly sex were more likely to report experiencing heart problems when they were interviewed again a few years later compared to men who were not sexually active. “Older men who found sex with their partner extremely pleasurable or satisfying had higher risk of cardiovascular events than men who did not feel so,” said study author Hui Liu, an associate professor of sociology at Michigan State University in a statement. Women, however, did not experience any increase in heart health problems with more sexual activity. In fact, women who reported feeling highly satisfied with their sex life had a lower risk of high blood pressure years later compared to women who didn’t hold the same level of satisfaction. Before older men give up on a healthy sexual relationship, it’s important to point out that the study only found a link between heart problems and sex, and it’s not definitive. More studies are needed to gain a clearer understanding of the benefits and risks of sex later in life, and whether the amount of sexual activity matters as people age. Liu recommends men have conversations with their physicians about their health and sexuality. Why might men have a higher risk for heart issues? While sex is shown to have health benefits, including better heart health, overdoing it late in life could be problematic, the study authors suggest. Overall, older men tend to have more sexual complications compared to younger men, and Liu argues that the exertion to reach orgasm could be causing heart stress. It’s also possible that medications men take to improve their sexual performance, like testosterone therapy, could be playing a role. However the researchers did not look at this connection in the study. What are the most important parts of this text?","output":"The most important parts of the text include the following: 1.

It's an excellent way to help our moms and dads around the house. In this article, we will learn three simple steps to care for your bed. Let's make our beds the comfiest and coziest place to rest! 1. Flip or Rotate the Mattress First, ask your mom or dad for help with this step. A mattress is the soft, squishy part of the bed that we sleep on. We need to flip (turn it over) or rotate (spin it around) the mattress to make it stay nice and comfy! Imagine you have a yummy sandwich. After eating half of it, you might flip it over to have a taste of the other side. That's just like flipping a mattress! It helps to wear out both sides evenly and makes for a comfy night's sleep. And if you just spin it around like a fun game, that's rotating! This is helpful because sometimes we sleep in one spot for many nights, and rotating it helps the mattress wear out evenly too. 2. Apply a Mattress Protector Next, we need a superhero to protect our mattress! Just kidding, we don't need a superhero. We need a mattress protector – a special cover that goes on top of the mattress. It's easy-peasy to put it on – just ask your mom or dad for help. A mattress protector is very important because it keeps our mattress clean from dirt, spills, and dust. Think about it like a shield that keeps our mattress safe and cozy. Putting on a mattress protector helps us sleep better and makes our mattress last longer too. 3. Make the Bed Now that our mattress is flipped and protected, it's time to make the bed! Gather your bed sheets, pillows, and comforter. Start by laying the bedsheet over the mattress. Pretend you're tucking in your teddy bear for bedtime – make sure it's snug and not crinkly. Next, let's fluff those pillows! Give the pillows some fun little shakes and pats, so they become extra-plump and soft. Then, place them nicely at the head of the bed. Lastly, let's cover the bed with your comforter. Spread it out like a big hug over the bed, and make sure it's smooth and covers the whole mattress. That's it! You've learned how to care for your bed in three easy steps: flipping or rotating the mattress, applying a mattress protector, and making the bed. Practice these steps with mom and dad, and soon, you'll be the best little helper in the house! Sweet dreams, kiddo!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Write an article based on this summary: – Is French designer Balenciaga making fun of its wealthy clients, or does it just know a thing or two about brand loyalty? Whatever the case, the Sun reports the fashion house is selling a mock white paper shopping bag for £876, which works out to roughly 1,110, and it's so popular it's sold out on Colette. It looks just like the free paper bags Balenciaga gives patrons their purchases in, only this one is made from calfskin and costs just a touch more. Time calls it Balenciaga's \\"latest effort to troll the fashion world\\" after it released a 2,145 version of one of those cheap blue IKEA shopping bags in April. In a one-up over the freebie paper bag, the new version does boast plenty of zippers and pockets inside. If you've got 1,110 burning a hole in your pocket and you want to walk around town looking perpetually like you've just shopped at Balenciaga, this bag's for you. (Some people are getting heel surgery to fit into designer shoes.)","output":"Title: Balenciaga's Mock Paper Shopping Bag: A Statement on Brand Loyalty or Just Another Fashion Troll? Introduction: French designer, Balenciaga, has always been at the forefront of high fashion and luxury goods. However, their recent release of the mock white paper shopping bag for a staggering £876 (around 1,110) has raised questions on whether the brand is making a social statement or just poking fun at its customers.  The Mock Paper Shopping Bag: Initially spotted on the popular French retailer's website, Colette, this Balenciaga bag is currently sold out. At first glance, the bag looks strikingly similar to the free paper bags given to customers at Balenciaga shopping outlets. The major difference lies in the materials used - the mock paper bag is made from calfskin. Additionally, the bag also features numerous pockets and zippers, unlike the original free paper bag.  A Trend of Trolling Fashion: Balenciaga's penchant for quirky designs and sharp wit is seen in their past releases, like the 2,145 IKEA-inspired blue shopping bag. Time magazine calls this design fad Balenciaga's \\"latest effort to troll the fashion world.\\"  Is this a statement on brand loyalty? The mock paper shopping bag could be seen as an exploration of brand loyalty. Its popularity shows that the power of a brand name like Balenciaga still remains strong, whether it's a luxurious item or simply a replica of a disposable paper bag.  Or, are they mocking their wealthy clients? While tapping into brand loyalty, it is also possible that Balenciaga is making fun of its wealthy clients by selling a high-priced version of a free shopping bag. The decision to charge such a hefty price for a bag that seemingly comes with Balenciaga's approval may leave some wondering if it's a tongue-in-cheek response. Conclusion: Balenciaga's mock paper shopping bag provokes a range of questions regarding its intent, but the extreme popularity and quick sell-out of the product indicate that the designer's target audience seems to be embracing the irony. Whether this is a statement on the fashion world's obsession with brands or an elaborate joke by the designer, seeking to make a statement through innovative design, Balenciaga has certainly captured the attention and wallets of fashion enthusiasts."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: I can use this background: In slippery conditions some riders prefer to ride fixed because they believe the transmission provides increased feedback on back tire grip. However, there is also an increased risk of loss of control in such conditions. This is especially so when taking into account the large number of riders who ride brakeless. These riders must brake entirely through the drivetrain. Ideally this is done by resisting the forward motion of the pedals, shedding speed while the bike is still moving. Alternatively, though far less efficiently, one can brake by stopping the motion of the pedals in mid-rotation, causing the rear wheel to lock in place, allowing the bicycle to skid and slow down from kinetic friction (see below).[22]  Descending any significant gradient is more difficult as the rider must spin the cranks at high speed (sometimes at 170 rpm or more), or use the brakes to slow down. Some consider that the enforced fast spin when descending increases suppleness or flexibility, which is said to improve pedalling performance on any type of bicycle; however the performance boost is negligible compared to the benefits of riding a free wheel.[23]  Now, I have a new situation: Two brothers had bike repair shops in neighboring towns.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article in one sentence. Depending upon your situation, the tightness of your pants may be making your erection worse. Try discreetly loosening your pants. Sit down behind a table or desk and unbuckle your belt. If needed, unbutton and partially unzip your pants to give your erection more \\"breathing room\\" with less pressure.  Be conscious of where you are. Don't be obvious. You don't want to be mistaken for some sort of pervert. If you have a bit of privacy, applying a cold pack to your crotch (outside your clothing) can soothe discomfort and encourage your erection to dissipate as well. If you've ever been in a cold swimming pool or outside on a cold day in shorts, you know that the penis and testes tend to retract towards the warmth of your body. While taking a cold shower is often considered the way to \\"cool off\\" raging sexual desires, a warm bath can actually provide a soothing, comfortable environment that may bring your erection to a faster conclusion.  Light exercise, like walking on a treadmill or simple aerobics, can also help provide distraction and a shift in blood distribution. These alternatives are often used as initial efforts to end a possible case of priapism, in which the pooled blood becomes trapped in the shaft of the penis. If you have an erection that lasts for more than four hours for any reason, seek medical attention immediately. If not treated quickly, priapism can lead to permanent damage, including but not limited to erectile dysfunction. This may not be easy to do with an erection, but urinating can sometimes make an erection go away. Urination causes pleasant, relaxing feelings in your groin, which can make an erection feel less \\"tight\\" or \\"urgent.\\" Waking up in the morning with an erection is common for men of all ages. It can occur with or without the prompting of sexually-arousing dreams. Despite the degree of difficulty in hitting your target while you have an erection, urinating can often help bring it to a conclusion quickly. When it comes down to it, the most effective way to end an erection is to bring it to its natural conclusion. Barring a medical condition, ejaculation almost invariably causes an erection to end.  Discreetly excuse yourself from the situation and find a private area: a bathroom, a bedroom, or anywhere else you feel sure that you won't disturb anyone. Do your business, clean up, and return to the situation relieved and ready to go. Avoid masturbating in public. If you do find yourself in a public place with an erection, find somewhere relatively private to do your thing. A lockable bathroom stall will do in a pinch, as long as you aren't loud or obvious about what you're doing. Public masturbation is illegal in many places, and you might disturb people if you aren't careful.","output":"Tight pants can make an erection worse, so loosening them, finding privacy, and trying different methods like cold packs, exercise, or urination can help make the erection go away."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the below context:  Stefan Lochner (the Dombild Master or Master Stefan; c. 1410 – late 1451) was a German painter working in the late \\"soft style\\" of the International Gothic. His paintings combine that era's tendency toward long flowing lines and brilliant colours with the realism, virtuoso surface textures and innovative iconography of the early Northern Renaissance. Based in Cologne, a commercial and artistic hub of northern Europe, Lochner was one of the most important German painters before Albrecht Dürer. Extant works include single-panel oil paintings, devotional polyptychs and illuminated manuscripts, which often feature fanciful and blue-winged angels. Today some thirty-seven individual panels are attributed to him with confidence. Less is known of his life. Art historians associating the Dombild Master with the historical Stefan Lochner believe he was born in Meersburg in south-west Germany around 1410, and that he spent some of his apprenticeship in the Low Countries. Records further indicate that his career developed quickly but was cut short by an early death. We know that he was commissioned around 1442 by the Cologne council to provide decorations for the visit of Emperor Frederick III, a major occasion for the city. Records from the following years indicate growing wealth and the purchase of a number of properties around the city. Thereafter he seems to have over-extended his finances and fallen into debt. Plague hit Cologne in 1451 and there, apart from the records of creditors, mention of Stephan Lochner ends; it is presumed he died that year, aged around 40. Lochner's identity and reputation were lost until a revival of 15th-century art during the early 19th-century romantic period. Despite extensive historical research, attribution remains difficult; for centuries a number of associated works were grouped and loosely attributed to the Dombild Master, a notname taken from the Dombild Altarpiece (in English cathedral picture, also known as the Altarpiece of the City's Patron Saints) still in Cologne Cathedral....

Here's a good solution: You can add wheels to the legs of the table. These wheels, also called casters, would help you to easily move the table around. However, to make the table stable, you should look for casters that have locks or brakes on them. When you need the table to be stable, you can simply lock the wheels, and it won't move anymore.  So, by adding casters with locks, you can make your heavy metal table both movable and stable when needed. It's like turning your table into a little toy car that you can push around when you want to, and stop when you need to."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Warner Bros. Records Inc. is an American major record label established in 1958 as the foundation label of the present-day Warner Music Group (WMG), and now operates as a wholly owned subsidiary of that corporation. Warner Bros. Records was established on March 19, 1958, as the recorded-music division of the American film studio Warner Bros.. For most of its early existence it was one of a group of labels owned and operated by larger parent corporations. The sequence of companies that controlled Warner Bros. and its allied labels evolved through a convoluted series of corporate mergers and acquisitions from the early 1960s to the early 2000s. Over this period, Warner Bros. Records grew from a struggling minor player in the music industry to become one of the top recording labels in the world.  In 2003, these music assets were divested by their then owner Time Warner and purchased by a private equity group. This independent company traded as the Warner Music Group before being bought by Access Industries in 2011. WMG is the smallest of the three major international music conglomerates and the world's last publicly traded major music company. Cameron Strang serves as CEO of the company.  Artists currently signed to Warner Bros. Records include Sleeping with Sirens, Cher, Kylie Minogue, Kimbra, the Goo Goo Dolls, Sheryl Crow, Ciara, Gorillaz, Adam Lambert, Bette Midler, Blur, Duran Duran, Fleet Foxes, Jason Derulo, Kid Rock, Lily Allen, Linkin Park, Muse, Nile Rodgers, the Red Hot Chili Peppers, the Black Keys, My Chemical Romance and Regina Spektor. 1. when were the music assets sold? 2. who was the parent company?

The report stated that there was a brush fire in the southwest part of Texas, where it was currently daytime. When he switched the channel, he saw another report about a different wildfire. This one was a forest fire in the northwest part of Seattle, where it was currently nighttime.  Which area, Texas or Seattle, will have higher wind speeds at the time of the fire?  Hint: Wildfire intensity increases during daytime hours. For example, burn rates of smoldering logs are up to five times greater during the day because of lower humidity, increased temperatures, and increased wind speeds. Sunlight warms the ground during the day and causes air currents to travel uphill, and downhill during the night as the land cools. Wildfires are fanned by these winds and often follow the air currents over hills and through valleys. United States wildfire operations revolve around a 24-hour fire day that begins at 10:00 a.m. because of the predictable increase in intensity resulting from the daytime warmth. A:","output":"Based on the provided hint, Texas is likely to have higher wind speeds at the time of the fire compared to Seattle. This is due to the fact that it is currently daytime in Texas, which typically leads to higher temperatures, lower humidity, and increased wind speeds. These factors contribute to greater wildfire intensity during daytime hours. In contrast, Seattle is experiencing nighttime when the land cools, resulting in downhill air currents and potentially lower wind speeds."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Factors contributing to habitat loss include: overconsumption, overpopulation, land use change, deforestation, pollution (air pollution, water pollution, soil contamination) and global warming or climate change.Habitat size and numbers of species are systematically related. Physically larger species and those living at lower latitudes or in forests or oceans are more sensitive to reduction in habitat area. Conversion to \\"trivial\\" standardized ecosystems (e.g., monoculture following deforestation) effectively destroys habitat for the more diverse species that preceded the conversion. Even the simplest forms of agriculture affect diversity – through clearing/draining land, discouraging weeds and \\"pests\\", and encouraging just a limited set of domesticated plant and animal species. In some countries lack of property rights or lax law/regulatory enforcement necessarily leads to biodiversity loss (degradation costs having to be supported by the community).A 2007 study conducted by the National Science Foundation found that biodiversity and genetic diversity are codependent—that diversity among species requires diversity within a species and vice versa. \\"If any one type is removed from the system, the cycle can break down and the community becomes dominated by a single species.\\"  Two continents had different histories. Asia was inhabited by many humans which destroyed most natural habitats through their activities. America was protective towards its environment and therefore thrived.  Which continent destroyed habitats by overconsumption? A:","output":"Asia is the continent that destroyed habitats by overconsumption. As mentioned in the question, Asia had a history of being inhabited by a large human population, which contributed to greater habitat destruction through their activities. The reasons for this overconsumption-driven habitat destruction include growing populations, increasing demands for resources, and rapid economic development. As a result, many natural habitats in Asia have been altered or destroyed to accommodate human needs and desires. Overconsumption can lead to various forms of environmental degradation, including deforestation, land conversion for agriculture or urbanization, pollution, and climate change. In Asia, the high demand for resources such as timber, agricultural products, and raw materials led to widespread deforestation, resulting in significant losses in tropical forests and biodiversity. These actions often disrupt ecosystems, leading to the endangerment or extinction of numerous species that rely on these habitats. Land use change in Asia is another critical factor contributing to habitat loss. As the human population grew, there was a continuous need to convert land for agriculture, industry, and urbanization purposes, which encroached upon and degraded natural ecosystems. This land use change, along with pollution and infrastructure development, further exacerbates habitat destruction and reduces the capacity of ecosystems to recover and maintain their resilience. In contrast, the Americas have historically had more stringent environmental protection policies that emphasized the need to conserve and protect natural habitats. Although the continent has not been immune to habitat destruction caused by human activities, the overall loss and degradation of ecosystems have been relatively lower compared to Asia. However, it is important to acknowledge that the Americas, too, face increasing environmental challenges due to development, climate change, and unsustainable resource consumption. In conclusion, it is Asia where overconsumption has led to more significant habitat destruction, driven by its large human population and increasing demands for resources. This has had severe consequences for biodiversity and ecosystems on the continent. It is essential for global efforts to focus on developing sustainable solutions that can help mitigate habitat loss, conserve biodiversity, and promote responsible resource consumption in both Asia and other regions around the world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Porky carefully plans a box of seeds, one by one while the man is busy mixing a bunch of bottles of items together. Porky goes to retrieve something as the man feeds the brand new mixture into the feeding bin for his chickens. But when they try it out, they spit the food out in disgust and seek food elsewhere.

The neighbor checks out his handy work and comments on it, allowing his chickens to come over and eat all of his fruits and vegetables. A little chick and a bigger chicken fight over a watermelon until it flings the chick away. The chick sadly retreats until it sees a bunch of spinach and decides to munch on it instead.

If you have every thought of becoming a blood donor, just register to do it. And you should never worry about the donation. Just under a pint (around 470ml) of blood is taken at one sitting. This amount is no more than 13 percent of your total blood volume, and is quickly replaced by your body. It may come as a surprise, but whole blood is only rarely used. Different blood components are used to treat a range of conditions. None goes to waste. Read blood cells are frequently used to replace heavy blood loss after an accident, surgery or childbirth. White blood cells and antibodies are used to help people fight infections if their immune system doesn't appear to be responding to antibiotics . Plasma ,the straw-coloured fluid which carries the blood cells and contains proteins, are used to treat burned patients. First-time donors should be aged between 17 and 65, weigh at least 50kg and be in good health. If you have donated before, you can start being a donor again up to your 70th birthday. Although most people are able to give blood, some people who pose health risks or are at a higher risk of having come into contact with an infectious disease are no tasked to be donors. Pregnant women or those who have had a baby in the last 9 months should not donate blood. Blood has a very short shelf life.

Objective: How to inflate a car tire. Which of the following solutions is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning? Options are: A). Remove valve stem cap, attach air nozzle, turn on and inflate, don't replace cap.. B). Remove valve stem cap, attach air nozzle, turn on and inflate, replace cap..","output":"B). Remove valve stem cap, attach air nozzle, turn on and inflate, replace cap. This solution is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning because it covers all the necessary steps in a logical order to properly inflate a car tire, ensuring safety and correct tire pressure. Let's analyze the steps in detail: 1. Remove valve stem cap: The valve stem cap is an essential component that keeps dirt and moisture away from the valve stem. Removing the cap allows you to access the valve itself, where you will need to attach the air nozzle in order to inflate the tire. 2. Attach air nozzle: Connecting the air nozzle to the valve stem is a crucial step as it is through this connection that the air will flow into the tire. The connection should be secure and tight to avoid any air leakage. There are different types of air nozzles available, and most tire inflators use the Schrader valve, which is standard for car tires. 3. Turn on and inflate: Once the air nozzle is securely connected, turning on the inflation mechanism allows the air to flow into the tire. You should always check the recommended tire pressure for your car, which can usually be found on a placard inside the driver's door, in the owner's manual, or on the tire sidewall. It's essential to keep a close eye on the tire pressure gauge (found on the air pump or a separate handheld gauge) while inflating to ensure that you don't overinflate or underinflate the tire. 4. Replace cap: After reaching the desired tire pressure and disconnecting the air nozzle, it's essential to replace the valve stem cap. The cap essentially functions as a secondary seal, helping to minimize air leakage from the valve stem and protect the valve from elements like dirt, moisture, and debris. A missing or damaged cap can lead to a slow air leak, causing your tire to lose pressure over time. This could affect your fuel efficiency, handling, and overall safety of the car. By following these steps in solution B, you can safely and efficiently inflate your car tire to the recommended pressure, ensuring optimal performance and safety on the road. Replacing the valve stem cap is a crucial aspect of inflating car tires, making option B the more sound solution in terms of naive physics reasoning."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It is the most abundant and widespread lead ore mineral and has been mined for its lead content for thousands of years. Galena is a lead sulfide mineral (PbS) that commonly occurs in hydrothermal veins, contact metamorphic environments, and in association with various other sulfide minerals. Galena's chemical composition is mainly composed of lead (86.6%) and sulfur (13.4%). Due to its high density, it is often found in large deposits and is easily recognizable by its metallic luster, cuboctahedral crystal structure, and its grey or silver color. Galena is a very dense and brittle mineral, which can be easily cleaved along three perfect cleavage planes, producing cubes or other shapes. The extraction and processing of lead from galena ore involve a combination of several steps. The process typically begins with the mining of the ore, which is followed by crushing and grinding to reduce the size of the mineral particles. After that, the ground ore is subjected to a froth flotation process to separate the lead sulfide from other associated minerals, such as zinc, iron, and copper sulfides. In the froth flotation process, the crushed and ground ore is mixed with water and various chemicals to create a slurry. Air is then introduced into the slurry, forming bubbles that rise to the surface carrying the hydrophobic lead sulfide particles. The froth on the surface, rich in lead sulfide, is collected and separated from the remaining gangue (unwanted minerals) in the slurry. This froth concentrate undergoes further purification and refining processes to extract the lead metal. After the froth flotation, the lead sulfide concentrate is roasted in a furnace, converting the lead sulfide to lead oxide (PbO). This step also helps remove any remaining sulfur as sulfur dioxide (SO2), which can be later used in the production of sulfuric acid. The lead oxide is then reduced to metallic lead (Pb) through a process known as smelting. This involves mixing the lead oxide with other materials, such as limestone or silica, and heating it above 1,000 °C in an oxygen-rich environment. Metallic lead separates from the mixture during this process and sinks to the bottom of the furnace, from where it can be collected and further refined. One of the final steps in lead production is refining, which involves removing any remaining impurities or non-lead components from the extracted lead. This can be done using a variety of methods, such as electrolysis, pyrometallurgical, and hydrometallurgical processes, depending on the specific composition of the initial lead metal. The pure lead is then cast into ingots or other forms and used for various industrial and manufacturing applications. Despite its widespread use, lead is highly toxic to humans, animals, and the environment. Prolonged exposure to lead can result in a variety of health issues, including neurological disorders, developmental issues in children, and other systemic problems. As a result, there have been increased efforts in recent years to minimize lead exposure and find alternative materials for various applications. Some countries have implemented strict regulations on the use of lead, including bans on lead-based paints and reduction of lead in gasoline."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This conclusion is based on the information provided in the premise and can be explained in detail as follows. The premise states two main points about the Beyazet Camii: 1. It is located on the east side of the square. 2. It was built in the early 16th century by Sultan Beyazet II, son of Mehmet the Conqueror. Now, let's analyze the hypothesis: The hypothesis states that the Beyazet Camii on the east side of the square dates back to the 16th century. Comparing the premise and the hypothesis, it becomes apparent that both statements convey similar information. The hypothesis simply condenses the information found in the premise without altering or contradicting anything. More specifically, the premise tells us that the Beyazet Camii is on the east side of the square, and the hypothesis reaffirms this by mentioning \\"the east side of the square.\\" Additionally, the premise states that the mosque was built in the early 16th century, and the hypothesis corresponds to this by asserting that it \\"dates back to the 16th century.\\" While the hypothesis doesn't mention the builder of the mosque or his relation to Mehmet the Conqueror, it does not deny or contradict this information either.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question: What is the missing first step of the following process:  -  Enters the lungs - The oxygen fills the sacs in your lungs - Carbon dioxide is removed from the lungs and exhaled - The oxygen is pass throughout your body. Answer:","output":"The missing first step of the process you mentioned pertains to the inhalation of oxygen. The whole sequence forms part of the respiratory process, which can be broken down into the following steps: 1. **Inhalation of Air**: The missing first step is the act of breathing in, or inhaling, which occurs when we take air into our lungs. This is enabled by the muscles of respiration - especially the diaphragm and intercostals (muscles between the ribs) contracting to increase the volume of the thoracic (chest) cavity. As the volume increases, the pressure within the thoracic cavity decreases, creating a pressure gradient between the atmosphere and the lungs. This pressure difference allows air to rush in, bringing with it vital oxygen. 2. **Air Enters the Lungs**: As you breathe in, air travels through your nose or mouth, down the pharynx, passes the epiglottis, and enters the trachea. The trachea splits into two bronchi, further split into bronchioles, finally reaches the air sacs or alveoli in the lungs, which is the site of gas exchange. 3. **Oxygen fills the Sacs in your Lungs**: Once the air reaches the alveoli, the oxygen it carries dissociates from the hemoglobin molecule and passes across the alveolar and capillary walls into the blood. 4. **Carbon Dioxide is Removed from the Lungs and Exhaled**: Meanwhile, carbon dioxide, a waste product of cellular metabolism, travels from the blood across the capillary and alveolar walls into the lungs. This gas is removed from the body when we exhale. 5. **The Oxygen is Passed Throughout Your Body**: The oxygen-rich blood is then transported throughout the body by the circulatory system. As the blood reaches cells, oxygen dissociates from the hemoglobin and moves into the cells where it is used in metabolic reactions that produce energy essential for cellular processes. Therefore, the process you are referring to is one of the most important biological functions in humans, illustrating how our body obtains oxygen from the atmosphere and utilizes it at the cellular level while also removing waste products. The missing step, inhalation of air, is a vital initial step, beginning the journey of oxygen into the body."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

With an estimated 1.5 million global participants and 100,000 new learners joining every year, kiteboarding is in the process of becoming an integral part of the Olympic competition. The sport offers various categories to cater to all levels of riders, including wave, freestyle, slalom, speed, and course racing. In this article, we will delve into the soaring world of kiteboarding, its categories, and its impact as an Olympic sport. Kiteboarding: A Brief Overview: Kiteboarding, also known as kitesurfing, is an exhilarating water sport that involves the user riding on a modified surfboard or kiteboard while being pulled by a large, controllable kite. The sport cultivates a perfect unison between the wind and water, allowing riders to showcase their skills and execute jaw-dropping aerial maneuvers. Due to its increasing popularity, the sport has also fostered a strong sense of community among its practitioners. Kiteboarding Categories: The diverse world of kiteboarding comprises five distinct categories, providing riders with multiple avenues to sharpen their skills and test their limits: 1. Wave: Wave kiteboarding has the rider using a surfboard or a specialized kiteboard to ride and maneuver on waves. This discipline demands excellent kite control, as well as the ability to read and predict wave patterns. 2. Freestyle: This category is arguably the most popular among kiteboarders. Freestyle kiteboarding showcases the rider's ability to perform impressive aerial tricks and stunts, such as handle passes, rotations, and inverted loops. 3. Slalom: In slalom kiteboarding, riders race through a course consisting of a series of buoys laid out in the water. The objective is to navigate the course as quickly as possible while demonstrating precise kite control and technical prowess. 4. Speed: The speed category highlights the swiftest and most agile riders in the kiteboarding community. Riders engage in time trials, attempting to achieve the fastest speeds possible over a set distance. 5. Course Racing: Course racing embodies a blend of speed and strategy, in which riders must complete a predefined course with multiple laps and buoy turns. Maintaining a balance between speed, kite control, and tactical decision-making is crucial in this category. Kiteboarding as an Olympic Sport: The decision to include kiteboarding in the 2016 Olympic lineup in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil signified a milestone moment in the evolution of the sport. As kiteboarding makes its Olympic debut, it brings a fresh, youthful dynamic to the games; simultaneously, it paves the way for further growth and development in the sport. The inclusion of kiteboarding in the Olympics is expected to attract new learners in droves, exponentially expanding its global following every year. Conclusion: Kiteboarding has carved a niche for itself among adrenaline junkies and water sports enthusiasts across the world. As it prepares to take center stage at the 2016 Rio Olympic games, the sport continues to traverse new heights and break boundaries.

They validate their statement by saying that watching the video is like having their teeth pulled, which is a common expression that suggests an experience was extremely unpleasant or painful.  The customer's dissatisfaction extends to the point of recommending the video only as a sleep aid for insomniacs, a sardonic remark suggesting that the video is boring and uninteresting, unable to hold an audience's attention. This in itself indicates that not only did the product fail on a content level according to this customer, but also on something as fundamental as being engaging to its viewers. Thus, taking into account all these factors, it's evident that the customer was highly dissatisfied with the video produced by the WWF. Their review is filled with strong negative language, criticism of the product’s content, and sarcastic remarks about its entertainment value, all of which conclusively suggest dissatisfaction."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: In year 2200, David is an astronaut and an avid galaxy hopper from a planet hundred light years away. He ended up in the solar system in search of water. He identified three planets, planet A, planet B and planet C. Little did he know that less than a hundred years ago people used to call planet A as Earth, planet B as Venus, and planet C as Mercury.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which planet would have lower pressure on the surface, planet A or planet B?  Hint: Clouds on Earth are made of water vapor. Venus's clouds are a lot less pleasant. They are made of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide and large amounts of corrosive sulfuric acid! The atmosphere of Venus is so thick that the pressure on the surface of Venus is very high. In fact, it is 90 times greater than the pressure at Earth’s surface! The thick atmosphere causes a strong greenhouse effect. As a result, Venus is the hottest planet. Even though it is farther from the Sun, Venus is much hotter even than Mercury. Temperatures at the surface reach 465°C (860°F). That’s hot enough to melt lead! Answer:","output":"Given the information provided in the paragraph, planet A, which used to be called Earth, would have lower pressure on its surface compared to planet B, which used to be known as Venus. The explanation for this lies in the composition and thickness of each planet's atmosphere. Planet A (Earth) has a relatively thinner atmosphere with clouds mainly composed of water vapor. The atmospheric pressure at Earth's surface is largely influenced by the weight of the air column above it. Earth's atmosphere consists of various gases, such as nitrogen, oxygen, and trace amounts of other gases, as well as water vapor. On the other hand, planet B (Venus) has an incredibly thick atmosphere, consisting of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and significant amounts of corrosive sulfuric acid. Due to the density and composition of its atmosphere, the pressure on the surface of Venus is 90 times greater than that on the surface of Earth. This heightened pressure is a direct result of the crushing weight of Venus's atmosphere. The thick atmosphere of Venus also causes a strong greenhouse effect, contributing to its extremely high surface temperatures of 465°C (860°F), which is even hotter than planet C (Mercury), despite being farther from the Sun. In summary, planet A (Earth) would have lower pressure on its surface compared to planet B (Venus) due to the significant differences in their atmospheric compositions and densities."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Given the below context:  The Norwegian Bratvaag expedition, studying the glaciers and seas of the Svalbard archipelago from the Norwegian sealing vessel Bratvaag of Ålesund, found the remains of the Andrée expedition on 5 August 1930. Kvitøya was usually inaccessible to the sealing or whaling ships of the time, as it is typically surrounded by a wide belt of thick polar ice and often hidden by thick ice fogs. However, summer in 1930 had been particularly warm, and the surrounding sea was practically free of ice. As Kvitøya was known to be a prime hunting ground for walrus and the fogs over the island on that day were comparatively thin, some of the crew of the Bratvaag took this rare opportunity to land on what they called the \\"inaccessible island\\".Two of the sealers in search of water, Olav Salen and Karl Tusvick, discovered Andrée's boat near a small stream, frozen under a mound of snow and full of equipment, including a boathook engraved with the words \\"Andrée's Polar Expedition, 1896\\". Presented with this hook, the Bratvaag's captain, Peder Eliassen, assigned the crew to search the site together with the expedition members. Among other finds, they uncovered a journal and two skeletons, identified as Andrée's and Strindberg's remains by monograms found on their clothing.The Bratvaag left the island to continue its scheduled hunting and observations, with the intent of coming back later to see if the ice had melted further and uncovered more artifacts. Further discoveries were made by the M/K Isbjørn of Tromsø, a sealing sloop chartered by news reporters to waylay the Bratvaag. Unsuccessful in this, the reporters and the Isbjørn crew made instead for Kvitøya, landing on the island on 5 September in fine weather and finding even less ice than the Bratvaag had. After photographing the area, they searched for and found Frænkel's body, and additional artifacts, including a tin box containing Strindberg's photographic film, his logbook, and maps. The crews of both ships turned over their finds to a scientific commission of the Swedish...

One of the key aspects of your alien characters should be how they look. To make your aliens seem convincing and interesting, you should try to be as detailed about their physical characteristics as you can. Because you are writing fiction, you have the ability to create as many strange and interesting details about your alien characters as you like. Avoid using familiar images or descriptions of aliens and use your imagination.  Think about how the aliens walk and move their bodies. You should also think about how their bodies are proportioned. They do not necessarily need to walk on two legs and have limbs like humans. They may have physical characteristics that have evolved due to their world or environment. For example, maybe your aliens have antennas on their heads because they can feel shifts in the wind in their world, allowing them to hunt for food more effectively. You should also think about whether there are different genders in the alien world and how the bodies of different genders appear. You do not have to be limited by male or female genders. Maybe the alien race has a third gender that is asexual or a combination of male and female genders. Avoid creating the alien characters in the shadow of humans and get creative with language, thinking beyond English or other languages found on Earth. You may decide to create an alien language that may then be translated with the help of a computerized device or an implant in the human brain. Your alien race may also communicate in other ways besides language or words. Maybe they use their antennas to send messages to each other or have the ability to communicate through telepathy. Perhaps they use a system of body movements to communicate. The humans in your story may also be key characters in the narrative, so you should create humans that are just as interesting as the aliens. Your main character may be a human with a special ability or a unique characteristic. Creating nuanced humans in your story will make it that much stronger. For example, maybe your main character is a human who has been gifted with the ability to read minds. This human is then able to access the conversations of the alien overlords, who have enslaved the human race. This ability could allow the human to save the humans from the aliens and become the hero of the story. Once you have sketched out your characters, you should identify the central conflict. Doing this will give the story an end goal and frame the narrative for the reader. It will also allow you to use your characters to build tension in the story. The central conflict may be between your alien characters or between an alien character and a human character. For example, maybe the central conflict of your story is that aliens have taken over the human world because their planet is no longer habitable. This alien invasion may then result in a human hero who tries to fight the aliens with a special ability and help from other humans in his community. Or, maybe the central conflict is that humans have enslaved aliens who have crash landed on their planet. The humans may then try to hide the aliens and experiment on them. This may then result in one alien who tries to oppose his human captors.","output":"In creating convincing and interesting alien characters, focus on their unique physical characteristics, communication methods, and the central conflict with humans, while infusing creativity and stepping beyond familiar tropes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

For that, he conducted two tests. In the first test, he used warmer reactants. He called it reactant A. In the second test, he used cooler reactants. He called it reactant B.  and a hint : When the temperature of reactants is higher, the rate of the reaction is faster. At higher temperatures, particles of reactants have more energy, so they move faster. As a result, they are more likely to bump into one another and to collide with greater force. For example, food spoils because of chemical reactions, and these reactions occur faster at higher temperatures (see the bread on the left in the Figure below ).

What is the answer to this question? when was the first national draft used in the united states?","output":"The first national draft in the United States occurred during the Civil War under the administration of President Abraham Lincoln. More accurately known as conscription, this mandatory enlistment for military service was an effort to replenish and boost the strength of the Union Army, which faced significant losses throughout the conflict. The Civil War began on April 12, 1861, as tensions between the North and South over issues like slavery and states' rights reached a boiling point. By 1862, it was clear that the war wouldn't end quickly, and the Union needed more troops to replace those lost in battle or through desertion. In response, the United States Congress passed the Militia Act of 1862, which allowed for the enlistment of African-American soldiers and included a provision for states to draft men if enlistment quotas were not met by volunteering efforts. However, this wasn't yet a nationwide draft. The first nationwide draft, called the Enrollment Act, was enacted on March 3, 1863. Also referred to as the Civil War Military Draft Act, this legislation called for all able-bodied men between the ages of 20 and 45, including immigrants seeking U.S. citizenship, to be eligible for conscription. However, this draft was not without controversy. The Enrollment Act allowed wealthier Americans to avoid service by hiring substitutes or paying a 300 fee to the government, which led to widespread resentment among the working and middle classes who were disproportionately affected. This anger culminated in the New York City Draft Riots in July 1863, resulting in the deaths of over 100 people, numerous injuries, and property damage. Despite the initial strife and discontent, the draft helped bolster the Union Army's ranks and ultimately played a role in the North's victory over the South. After the war, conscription was discontinued, but it would be reintroduced during World War I. In summary, the first national draft used in the United States was instituted on March 3, 1863, during the Civil War under President Abraham Lincoln's administration. It aimed to address the urgent need for more troops in the Union Army and eventually contributed to the Union's success."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

When you walk on the road, you will find a lot of people riding bicycles to school, shops and anywhere else. Therefore , China is known as \\"the kingdom of bicycles\\". In China, many families have one or two bicycles. Compared(......) with cars, bicycles have many advantages. First, they are much cheaper than cars. Most Chinese can't afford cars, but they can afford bicycles. Second, bicycles are small enough to park anywhere, while cars need a larger piece of land to park. What's more, with lower speed, bicycles are safer than cars. However, bicycles also bring some problems. Some riders don't obey the traffic rules and some riders don't think about others' safety. So they ride too fast. During rush hours, too many bicycles may cause traffic jams. _ What problems can bicycles bring? A) Bicycles are more and more expensive. B) Riding bicycles is more dangerous than driving cars. C) There are no places for so many bicycles. D) Too many bicycles may cause traffic jams. Answer:","output":"D) Too many bicycles may cause traffic jams. Bicycles, while being a popular and efficient means of transportation in China, can also bring about certain problems. The primary issue that arises due to the increased usage of bicycles is traffic congestion. When there are too many bicycles on the roads, especially during rush hours, it can lead to traffic jams. This is because the roads become overcrowded with riders, making it difficult for everyone to move at a comfortable pace and maintain order. Although bicycles are generally more affordable and environmentally friendly than cars, their popularity can be a double-edged sword. In addition to causing traffic jams, the increased number of bicycles on the roads can also contribute to other issues. For instance, some bicycle riders may not follow proper traffic rules or prioritize the safety of other road users. This can result in accidents or slow-moving traffic, causing inconvenience and disruptions to people's daily commutes. Furthermore, while bicycles are smaller and easier to park compared to cars, the sheer number of bikes in China might make it challenging to find suitable and secure parking spaces. This can lead to bicycles being parked haphazardly or in unauthorized areas, which can cause obstructions and inconvenience for pedestrians and other road users. In summary, the main problem associated with having too many bicycles in China is traffic congestion, which stems from overcrowded roads and can lead to traffic jams. However, there are also other associated issues such as unsafe riding behavior and challenges with finding adequate parking spaces. These problems highlight the need for effective urban planning and infrastructure development that can cope with the rising demand for bicycle usage in the country."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation?  - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process A:","output":"If there are fewer bacteria in the environment, it would lead to fewer instances of bacterial infections and, as a result, fewer damaged cells. In this scenario, the supposed perturbation would be \\"indirectly impacting a step of the process.\\" Here's a more detailed explanation: When bacteria enter the body, they can cause an infection by multiplying rapidly and attacking various cells in the body. The severity of their impact on the body varies depending on the type of bacteria, the strength of the individual's immune system, and other environmental factors. The process you've described outlines the general sequence of events that follow when an infection affects the body: 1. Bacteria enters the body through various means such as ingestion, inhalation, or open wounds. 2. Bloodstream: Bacteria enter the host's bloodstream, which facilitates their travel throughout the body. 3. Cells in the body are attacked: Bacteria produce toxins or directly invade tissue, leading to cell damage. 4. Cells are killed: As infected cells die, the body's immune system attempts to clear dead cells and fight off the remaining invaders. 5. Different kinds of sickness are formed: As damage occurs at the cellular level, symptoms of illness or disease emerge depending on the affected area of the body. If there were fewer bacteria present in the environment, it would mean that individuals would have a lower probability of encountering harmful bacteria. With the reduced likelihood of bacterial infections, there would be fewer cases of cells being attacked and damaged by these bacterial pathogens. Consequently, less sickness and disease related to bacterial infections would develop. In this situation, the perturbation does not directly impact a step of the process since the steps themselves would remain unchanged. Instead, it indirectly impacts the process by influencing the likelihood of certain steps occurring based on the reduced presence of bacteria in the environment. By limiting the number of potential bacterial encounters, the probability of each step in the infection process would be lowered, ultimately leading to a decreased likelihood of cell damage and sickness."},{"instruction":"Q:Question: How many times Irmgard Moller stabbed in the chest If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: The Baader Meinhof Complex Context: The film begins on a nude beach in Germany in the late 1960s, where we are introduced to Ulrike Meinhoff, a respected journalist, and her family. Meinhoff and her husband are then guests at a party, where Meinhoff reads off a periodical that she wrote about the injustice of the Iranian Government. With the Shah of Persia arriving into Berlin, there is a rally in the streets, where half the people are protesting the injustice and the other half are praising. As the protesting goes on, the Iranian people end up going into the crowd and fighting the innocent German protesters with the help of the German Police; leaving many injured and a man killed. The next scene is of Meinhoff at a television studio arguing why she favors the protesters side instead of the Governments side, and watching the live recording on her television is Gudrun Ensslin, another activist. She explains to her parents how American Imperialism is completely corrupt while Meinhoff walks in on her husband having sex with another woman. Next, we are introduced to Andreas Baader, the ringleader of these revolutionaries who decide to name themselves The Red Army Faction (RAF). Their first major rebellious occurrence takes place in a department store, where they decide to set home made bombs and light it on fire. On a television broadcast we are informed of the many student protests at universities across America and of protests in West Germany, being led by Rudi Dutschke. The film then cuts to a famous rally where Dutschke announced his views on the protest and wars occurring around the world, trying to spark everyone to join their resistance. Rudi Dutschke is then almost assassinated by a man who is accused to be from the Springer Group, which is tied to the German Government. In effect, many activists go to the Springer Group headquarters and riot. As we see there are many demonstrating protesters rioting around the world, Baader and Ensslin are in court confessing about the department store fires.

Question: Information:  - The River Severn (Welsh: \\"Afon Hafren\\", Latin: \\"Sabrina\\") is the longest river in the United Kingdom, at about . It rises at an altitude of on Plynlimon, close to the Ceredigion/Powys border near Llanidloes, in the Cambrian Mountains of mid Wales. It then flows through Shropshire, Worcestershire and Gloucestershire, with the county towns of Shrewsbury, Worcester and Gloucester on its banks. With an average discharge of at Apperley, Gloucestershire, the Severn is the greatest river in terms of water flow in England and Wales.  - Shrewsbury (or ) is the county town of Shropshire, England. It is on the River Severn and has a population of approximately 72,000.  - Aston Pigott is a hamlet approximately 12 miles west of Shrewsbury within the parish of Worthen and Shelve . The current population stands at around 50 . The hamlet is situated on a small rise giving many of the properties an outstanding view across the Rea Brook valley to the Stiperstones . It contains three working farms that are mainly dairy and lamb farms . The hamlet is served primarily by Worthen which is 1 mile to the west . It adjoins Aston Rogers . The name Aston Pigott probably evolved from East Tun or Town and from the name of the Picot family of Norman descent . In 1180 Ralph Fitz Picot was granted lands by the Corbets , and it was Ralph 's descendants , notably Robert Pigot in 1255 followed by Howel Pigot who established the modern village name . Mains water arrived in 1947 and mains electricity in 1948 .  - Shropshire (or ; alternatively Salop; abbreviated, in print only, Shrops; demonym Salopian ) is a county located between West Midlands in England and Wales. It borders Powys and Wrexham in Wales to the west and north-west, Cheshire to the north, Staffordshire to the east, Worcestershire to the south-east and Herefordshire to the south. Shropshire Council was created in 2009, a unitary authority taking over from the previous county council and five district councils. The borough of Telford and Wrekin has been a separate unitary authority since 1998 but continues to be included in the ceremonial county.  - In England, a civil parish is a territorial designation which is the lowest tier of local government below districts and counties, or their combined form, the unitary authority. It is an administrative parish, in contrast to an ecclesiastical parish.  - The name Rea Brook can refer to either of two brooks (a local term for a small river) in Shropshire, England.  - A County town is usually the location of administrative or judicial functions within the county, or it has been established over time as the \\"de facto\\" main town of a county. The concept of a county town eventually became detached from its original meaning of where the county administration or county hall is based. In fact, many county towns are no longer part of the administrative county. For example, Nottingham is administered by a unitary authority entirely separate from the rest of Nottinghamshire. Many county towns are classified as cities, but all are referred to as county towns regardless of whether city status is held or not.  - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight.  - Worthen is a village in Shropshire, England approximately 13 miles west of Shrewsbury. The village forms part of the Worthen with Shelve civil parish, which includes the hamlet of Little Worthen immediately to the north-east and the villages of Brockton and Pennerley, in addition to several smaller settlements. It sits in the Rea Brook valley. To the south are the Stiperstones and the Bromlow Callow, known for the small clump of trees on top. To the north is Long Mountain.  - The Stiperstones is a distinctive hill in the county of Shropshire, England. It is a quartzite ridge formed some 480 million years ago. During the last Ice Age the summit stood out above the glaciers and was subject to constant freezing and thawing which shattered the quartzite into a mass of jumbled scree surrounding several residual rocky tors. At above sea level it is the second-highest hill in the county, surpassed only by Brown Clee Hill. Stiperstones' summit ridge is crowned by several rugged, jagged outcrops of rock silhouetted against the sky.    What is the relationship between 'aston pigott' and 'shropshire'? Answer:","output":"Aston Pigott is a hamlet located in the county of Shropshire, England. It is approximately 12 miles west of Shrewsbury, which is the county town of Shropshire. This hamlet lies within the parish of Worthen and Shelve and has a population of around 50 people. Therefore, the relationship between Aston Pigott and Shropshire is that Aston Pigott is a small settlement within the geographical boundaries of Shropshire County."},{"instruction":"In this task, you are given a sentence in the Gujarati language and your task is to convert Gujarati sentence into the English language.

Surrealism is characterized by its exploration of the subconscious mind, dreamlike imagery, and the combination of unexpected or seemingly unrelated elements. Dalí's works often feature distorted forms, vivid colors, and symbolic references, which create a sense of dreamlike reality and challenge the viewer's understanding of reality and fantasy.

Several reasons contribute to this assessment: 1. The reviewer mentions that the screenplay \\"lags badly in the middle,\\" which implies that the pacing and the story's progression are not up to their expectations. This kind of pacing issue often prevents the audience from fully immersing themselves in the film. 2. The movie's genre appears to be a mix of comedy, drama, and action. However, the reviewer critiques these elements by stating that the comedy is \\"not-very-funny,\\" and the dramatics are \\"unconvincing.\\" This indicates that the film's content might not have resonated with the reviewer or that the execution was insufficient to bring out desired reactions. 3. The reference to the \\"last-minute action strongly reminiscent of 'Run Lola Run'\\" suggests that the reviewer found this aspect to lack originality. Drawing a comparison to another well-known film may lead readers to believe that the movie under review did not offer a unique or fresh approach to its action sequences. In conclusion, the reviewer's negative opinion is conveyed through their critique of the film's pacing, the lack of effectiveness in its genre elements, and the absence of originality in certain aspects.

Terius Nash was born in Rockingham, North Carolina. He moved with his mother to Atlanta when he was two years old. After first learning to play trumpet in elementary school, Nash learned how to play the drums and guitar. His mother died in 1992 when Nash was fifteen years old, an event which would inspire him to write songs. In 2007 Nash signed a record contract with Def Jam Recordings and began working on his debut studio album Love Hate. The album was produced by The-Dream, his production partner Tricky Stewart, and Los da Mystro, and featured Fabolous and Rihanna. The album was written and recorded in eight days with twelve tracks making the final cut. Released December 11, 2007, on The-Dream's Def Jam imprint Radio Killa Records, the album featured the singles \\"Shawty Is a 10\\", \\"Falsetto\\" and \\"I Luv Your Girl\\" and received generally positive reviews from critics, as Rolling Stone called it \\"one of the most likable R&B records of the year\\" and UrbanMusicReviews.com said that the singer had \\"hit a home run\\". In June 2008, The-Dream was named Best New Artist at the BET Awards.  Nash wrote and produced Beyonce's \\"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\\", which was included on her third studio album I Am... Sasha Fierce and released in 2008. The song went on to win the Grammy Award for Song of the Year and Best R&B Song, becoming the first career wins at the Grammys for The Dream.  On March 10, 2009, The-Dream released his second album Love vs. Money. He re-teamed with Tricky Stewart, who produced most of the tracks on the album, and Los da Mystro. The album featured Mariah Carey, Kanye West, and Lil Jon and featured the singled \\"Rockin' That Shit\\", \\"Walkin' on the Moon\\" and \\"Sweat It Out\\". Upon its release, the album received general acclaim from most music critics, based on an aggregate score of 83/100 from Metacritic and it was more commercially successful than its predecessor, debuting at number two on the Billboard 200.  During the making of Love King, he recorded a song with T-Pain and expressed that he would like to make a collaborative album with Kanye West in the future. In January 2010, The-Dream stated he was finished recording the album and he called it the best of his three albums. The album was released on June 29, 2010. Before the album's release, The-Dream announced that Love King will be his last solo album. Once again produced by The-Dream, Christopher \\"Tricky\\" Stewart, and Los da Mystro, the album spawned the singles \\"Love King\\" and \\"Make Up Bag\\".

Here are possible answers to this question: - bowling alley - city - military base - fashion show - football game  I believe the correct choice is \\"bowling alley\\", here's why: A:","output":"Bowling Alley You are correct, the term \\"gutters\\" in the context of preventing a ball from becoming runway refers to a bowling alley. Gutters are the two long channels or depressions on either side of the lane in a bowling alley, extending from the front down to where the pins are set. When a ball is bowled, the gutters are meant to catch and return it to the ball return mechanism if it veers off course. Here's a brief explanation of why the other options are not the correct choice in this context: - City: Gutters in a city generally refer to the stormwater drainage systems on the sides of streets. These gutters do not prevent a ball from becoming runway but instead help channel away rainwater and melted snow. - Military Base: Gutters have no significant association with preventing balls from becoming runway on a military base. A military base has different types of infrastructure for various purposes, such as housing, transportation, and storage, but bowling is typically not a significant part of this infrastructure. - Fashion Show: In the context of a fashion show, a runway refers to the stage or walkway upon which models display clothing and accessories. Gutters have no relevance in a fashion show scenario, as these events do not involve any physical activity or sports equipment. - Football Game: In a football game, the term \\"runway\\" could refer to the distance a player runs when carrying the ball. However, gutters are not part of a football field and do not play any role in preventing a ball from becoming runway in football. In summary, a bowling alley is the correct choice because gutters are integral components of the bowling lane system and serve to catch and return a ball that veers off course, thereby preventing it from becoming runway."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question: Article: Most people think that the capital of the movie world is Hollyhood, in the United States. However, the real movie capital is Mumbai, in India. Mumbai used to be known as Bombay, and so the film industry there is called \\"Bollywood.\\" Bollywood makes twice as many movies each year as Hollyhood--more than 800 films a year. The movies from Bollywood are very different from Hollywood movies. For one thing, Bollywood movies are much longer than most Hollywood movies. Most Bollywood movies are more than three hours long, and contain singing, dancing, action, adventure, mystery, and romance (but usually no kissing). Because Bollywood films contain so many different features, this style of film is sometimes called a \\"masala\\" film. (\\"Masala\\" is an Indian word for a mixture of spices.) Another big difference between Bollywood and Hollywood movies is the way movies are made. It takes much longer to make a movie in Hollywood than in Bollywood. In fact, filming may begin on a Bollywood movie before the script even finished. The director and writers can make up the story while the film is being made. Sometimes they will even write the script by hand instead of taking time to type it. Bollywood actors are very popular and some are in such high demand that they may work on several movies at the same time. They may even shoot scenes for several films on the same day using the same costumes and scenery. Since most Bollywood movies follow the same kind of story, shooting scenes for several films at the same time is not a big problem for actors or directors. This also helps keep the cost of Bollywood movies lower than the cost of Hollywood movies. The average Bollywood film, with a budget of only two million U.S. dollars, seems very cheap compared to the average budget of sixty million U.S. dollars for a Hollywood film--thirty times as much! Question: What is the main topic of the reading? Yes or no, is the answer \\"the differences between two movie industries\\"?

Q: Passage: South Africas mass unemployment dates back to the 1970s, and continued to rise through the 1980s and 1990s. Unemployment has increased substantially since the African National Congress came to power in 1994, going from 15.6% in 1995 to 30.3% in 2001. In the second quarter of 2010, the jobless rate increased to 25.3%, and the number of people with work fell by 61,000 to 12.7 million. The biggest decline in employment was recorded in the manufacturing industry, which shed 53,000 workers. Agriculture lost 32,000 jobs, employment in the construction industry fell by 15,000. In the third quarter of 2010, 29.80% of blacks were officially unemployed, compared with 22.30% of coloureds, 8.60 of Asians and 5.10% of whites. A:","output":"Q: How many more percentage points did black unemployment increase compared to white unemployment between 1995 and 2001? A: Using 15.6% as a baseline statistic in 1995, the total unemployment increased to 30.3% in 2001. For blacks, the unemployment in the third quarter of 2010 was 29.80%, and for whites, it was 5.10%. The increase for blacks was (29.80 - 15.6) = 14.2 percentage points, and for whites, it was (5.10 - 15.6) = -10.5 percentage points.

Q: How many jobs were lost in the manufacturing, agriculture, and construction industries combined in the second quarter of 2010? A: The manufacturing industry lost 53,000 workers, agriculture lost 32,000 jobs, and employment in the construction industry fell by 15,000. The total jobs lost in these industries are (53,000 + 32,000 + 15,000) = 100,000 jobs. Q: What was the total percentage of unemployed Asians, coloureds, and whites in the third quarter of 2010?

Six weeks later, CIA Deputy Director Pamela Landy (Joan Allen) divulges the audiotaped confession of Ward Abbott, the late former head of Treadstone, to Director Ezra Kramer (Scott Glenn). Meanwhile, in Turin, journalist Simon Ross (Paddy Considine) of The Guardian meets an informant to learn about Bourne and Operation Blackbriar, the program succeeding Treadstone. The CIA tracks Ross as he returns to London, after his mention of \\"Blackbriar\\" during a cell-phone call to his editor is detected by the ECHELON system. Bourne reappears in Paris to inform Martin Kreutz (Daniel BrÃ¼hl), the step-brother of his girlfriend Marie Helena Kreutz (Franka Potente), of her assassination in India, also in the previous film. Bourne reads Ross's articles and arranges a meeting with him at London Waterloo station. Bourne realizes that the CIA is following Ross and helps him evade capture for a while, but when Ross panics and ignores Bourne's instructions, Blackbriar assassin Paz (Ãdgar RamÃ­rez) shoots him dead, in the middle of a busy station, on orders of Deputy Director Noah Vosen (David Strathairn).

Step 2: Avoid Making Threats As tensions rise during difficult phone calls, the temptation to make threats can be challenging to resist. However, making threats is never the solution. It might escalate the situation, lead to possible legal issues, and prevent reaching a resolution. It is crucial to maintain a professional and courteous demeanor throughout the call and focus on addressing the issue at hand. Step 3: Grab a Notepad A necessary yet often overlooked step is keeping a notepad and pen nearby. Writing notes during a phone call will assist you in remembering important details and help you track the progress of the conversation. Moreover, having these notes will come in handy if there is any follow-up communication. Step 4: Copy Down the Number Jot down the caller's phone number on your notepad. This information will be useful if you need to call them back or report the call to authorities. It's essential to have a record of all incoming calls, so having the number handy ensures you can reference it later if necessary. Step 5: Write Down the Day and Time Document the day and time of the call. By doing so, you can accurately track the details of the conversation for future reference. These records may be important if the call is related to an ongoing issue, and keeping track of the call history could benefit you in the long run. Additionally, having a record of the timeline can provide context when reviewing communications. Step 6: Give a Coworker a Handwritten Note If the situation requires support from colleagues or higher-ups, prepare a handwritten note summarizing the call to share with them. Keep the note concise, but make sure to include relevant information such as the caller's name, number, and main concerns. Passing along this information to your coworkers can help achieve a quick and effective solution. This procedure also fosters a collaborative work environment where employees can support each other during challenging moments. Step 7: Listen to the Caller  Lastly, give your full attention to the caller, intently listen to their concerns, and avoid interrupting them. Practice active listening skills by acknowledging what the caller is saying, asking clarifying questions, and repeating pertinent information to ensure you understand their perspective. Listening and empathizing with the caller is key to addressing the issue and achieving a positive outcome. Conclusion Handling difficult or stressful phone calls is challenging, but following these simple steps can make all the difference. By practicing effective communication, remaining calm, and keeping detailed notes, you will be better prepared to manage any unexpected situation that arises during a phone call."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Two robots share a kiss. A male and female robot are kissing.","output":"I would rate the similarity between these two sentences as a 4 on a scale of 0-5, where 0 stands for \\"not similar\\" and 5 stands for \\"very similar.\\" Both sentences describe the interaction between two robots that involve a kiss. They convey nearly the same information and are similar in their core message. However, there are a few subtle differences between the two sentences that prevent them from being exactly identical: 1. Sentence 1 mentions \\"Two robots share a kiss,\\" which does not provide any explicit information about the robots' gender or whether they represent a specific gender. Sentence 2, on the other hand, specifies the genders of the robots by mentioning, \\"A male and female robot are kissing.\\" The difference in detail might lead the reader to visualize different situations or attach different meanings to each sentence. However, this addition of extra detail about genders is not significant enough to make them dissimilar. 2. The structure of both sentences differs slightly. Sentence 1 is more concise, describing a single, shared action between the robots in the form of \\"share a kiss.\\" In contrast, Sentence 2 uses a subject-verb-object structure, implying a distinct action between the male and female robot, \\"are kissing.\\" However, this syntactic change does not drastically change the overall meaning of the two sentences. Overall, the meaning of these sentences is quite similar, but the slight differences in context and structure prevent them from being a perfect match, which is why I rate their similarity as 4."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What are the names of the parents that the North Korean propaganda song, \\"We Will Follow Only You\\", is dedicated to? A:","output":"The North Korean propaganda song, \\"We Will Follow Only You\\" (also translated as \\"We Will Go Along Only With You\\"), is dedicated to the late North Korean leader Kim Il-sung and his son, Kim Jong-il. They are considered the \\"parents\\" (figuratively, as they are not biologically related to the entire nation) of the North Korean people in the context of this song, as it expresses loyalty, admiration, and commitment to following their leadership and guidance. Kim Il-sung, the founder of North Korea and the country's first leader – known as \\"Great Leader\\" or \\"Eternal President\\" – ruled from 1948 to 1994. Under his leadership, North Korea established a socialist system and closely aligned itself with the Soviet Union. His son, Kim Jong-il, referred to as \\"Dear Leader,\\" succeeded him and ruled North Korea from 1994 until his death in 2011. Kim Jong-il continued and expanded upon his father's policies, further developing North Korea's military capabilities and strengthening the cult of personality around the Kim family. The song \\"We Will Follow Only You\\" is performed by the Moranbong Band, a popular all-female music group in North Korea, which was reportedly founded by Kim Jong-un, the grandson of Kim Il-sung and the third generation leader of North Korea.

In some trees, the wood laid on late in the life of a tree is softer, lighter, weaker, and more even-textured than that produced earlier, but in other trees, the reverse applies. This may or may not correspond to heartwood and sapwood. In a large log the sapwood, because of the time in the life of the tree when it was grown, may be inferior in hardness, strength, and toughness to equally sound heartwood from the same log. In a smaller tree, the reverse may be true.\\"  Answer:","output":"Sometimes, a tree that is near death lays wood that can have varying properties, depending on the specific tree and its stage of growth. These properties can be different from the wood produced earlier in the tree's life. In some trees, the wood laid on late in the tree's life may be softer, lighter, weaker, and more even-textured than the wood produced earlier. In other trees, the opposite may occur, with the wood becoming harder, denser, stronger, and less even-textured towards the end of the tree's life. These differences in wood properties may not necessarily correspond to the distinction between heartwood and sapwood. In a large log, the sapwood, which is produced later in the tree's life, might be inferior in hardness, strength, and toughness when compared to equally sound heartwood originating from the same log. However, in a smaller tree, the sapwood may be superior in these properties compared to the heartwood. The variations in wood properties near the end of a tree's life can be attributed to multiple factors, such as environmental conditions, local climate, and the tree's overall growth rate and health. As a result, it is essential to consider these factors when selecting wood from a tree for specific applications or uses."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

A computer requires programs to function, and typically executes the program's instructions in a central processing unit.  - An application domain is a mechanism (similar to a process in an operating system) used within the Common Language Infrastructure (CLI) to isolate executed software applications from one another so that they do not affect each other. Each application domain has its own virtual address space which scopes the resources for the application domain using that address space.  - A text editor is a type of program used for editing plain text files. Such programs are sometimes known as \\"notepad\\" software, following the Microsoft Notepad.  - Emacs and its derivatives are a family of text editors that are characterized by their extensibility. The manual for the most widely used variant, GNU Emacs, describes it as \\"the extensible, customizable, self-documenting, real-time display editor\\". Development of the first Emacs began in the mid-1970s and continues actively .  - A scripting or script language is a programming language that supports scripts, programs written for a special run-time environment that automate the execution of tasks that could alternatively be executed one-by-one by a human operator. Scripting languages are often interpreted (rather than compiled). Primitives are usually the elementary tasks or API calls, and the language allows them to be combined into more complex programs. Environments that can be automated through scripting include software applications, web pages within a web browser, the shells of operating systems (OS), embedded systems, as well as numerous games. A scripting language can be viewed as a domain-specific language for a particular environment; in the case of scripting an application, this is also known as an extension language. Scripting languages are also sometimes referred to as very high-level programming languages, as they operate at a high level of abstraction, or as control languages, particularly for job control languages on mainframes.  - In computing, executable code or an executable file or executable program, sometimes simply an executable or binary, causes a computer \\"to perform indicated tasks according to encoded instructions,\\" as opposed to a data file that must be parsed by a program to be meaningful. These \\"instructions\\" are traditionally machine code instructions for a physical CPU. However, in a more general sense, a file containing instructions (such as bytecode) for a \\"software\\" interpreter may also be considered executable; even a scripting language source file may therefore be considered executable in this sense. The exact interpretation depends upon the use; while the term often refers only to machine code files, in the context of protection against computer viruses all files which cause potentially hazardous instruction execution, including scripts, are lumped together for convenience.  - In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm is a self-contained sequence of actions to be performed. Algorithms perform calculation, data processing, and/or automated reasoning tasks.  - Computer programming (often shortened to programming) is a process that leads from an original formulation of a computing problem to executable computer programs. Programming involves activities such as analysis, developing understanding, generating algorithms, verification of requirements of algorithms including their correctness and resources consumption, and implementation (commonly referred to as coding) of algorithms in a target programming language. Source code is written in one or more programming languages. The purpose of programming is to find a sequence of instructions that will automate performing a specific task or solving a given problem. The process of programming thus often requires expertise in many different subjects, including knowledge of the application domain, specialized algorithms, and formal logic.   - A programming language is a formal computer language designed to communicate instructions to a machine, particularly a computer. Programming languages can be used to create programs to control the behavior of a machine or to express algorithms.  - XEmacs is a graphical- and console-based text editor which runs on almost any Unix-like operating system as well as Microsoft Windows. XEmacs is a fork, based on a version of GNU Emacs from the late 1980s. Any user can download, use, and modify XEmacs as free software available under the GNU General Public License version 2 or any later version.  - Computing is any goal-oriented activity requiring, benefiting from, or creating a mathematical sequence of steps known as an algorithm  e.g. through computers. Computing includes designing, developing and building hardware and software systems; processing, structuring, and managing various kinds of information; doing scientific research on and with computers; making computer systems behave intelligently; and creating and using communications and entertainment media. The field of computing includes computer engineering, software engineering, computer science, information systems, and information technology.  - Emacs Lisp is a dialect of the Lisp programming language used as a scripting language by Emacs (a text editor family most commonly associated with GNU Emacs and XEmacs). It is used for implementing most of the editing functionality built into Emacs, the remainder being written in C (as is the Lisp interpreter itself). Emacs Lisp is also referred to as Elisp, although there is also an older, unrelated Lisp dialect with that name.  - GNU Emacs is the most popular and most ported Emacs text editor. It was created by GNU Project founder Richard Stallman. In common with other varieties of Emacs, GNU Emacs is extensible using a Turing complete programming language. GNU Emacs has been called \\"the most powerful text editor available today.\\" With proper support from the underlying system, GNU Emacs is able to display files in multiple character sets, and has been able to simultaneously display most human languages since at least 1999. Throughout its history, GNU Emacs has been a central component of the GNU project, and a flagship of the free software movement. GNU Emacs is sometimes abbreviated as GNUMACS, especially to differentiate it from other EMACS variants. The tag line for GNU Emacs is \\"the extensible self-documenting text editor\\".  - In computer programming , apel ( the initialism represents \`\` A Portable Emacs Library '' ) provides support for writing portable code in Emacs Lisp .

Background: Duncan Lee Hunter (born May 31, 1948) is an American politician. He was a Republican member of the House of Representatives from California's 52nd, 45th and 42nd districts from 1981 to 2009. Hunter was the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee during the 108th and 109th Congress. Hunter sought the Republican Party nomination for President of the United States for 2008, but his campaign failed to attract significant voters or delegates in early primary and caucus states, and he dropped out after the Nevada Republican caucuses. Context: In 1980, Hunter was recruited to run for Congress in what was then the 42nd District against 18-year incumbent Democrat Lionel Van Deerlin. Hunter was initially an underdog in a district where Democrats outnumbered Republicans by almost 2 to 1. However, his attacks on Van Deerlin's record on national defense gained traction in a district dominated by military bases and personnel. Van Deerlin did not respond quickly enough, and Hunter narrowly defeated him. He was one of many Republicans swept into office from historically Democratic districts as a result of the \\"Reagan revolution\\"; Van Deerlin had been the district's only congressman since its creation in 1963. After the 1980 census, many of the more Democratic areas were cut out of Hunter's district, and he was reelected 13 more times with no substantive opposition. His district was renumbered as the 45th District in 1983 and the 52nd in 1993.  In the 2006 general election, he defeated Navy veteran/minister John Rinaldi, a Democrat, and Michael Benoit, a Libertarian. Hunter was re-elected with 65 percent of the vote, a 33-point margin over Rinaldi.  On March 20, 2007, Hunter announced that, as part of his presidential bid, he would not seek re-election to the House of Representatives in 2008. After his son, Duncan D. Hunter, announced his candidacy for his father's seat, the younger Hunter was recalled by the United States Marine Corps to serve in the Operation Enduring Freedom - Afghanistan. During Duncan D. Hunter's active service, his wife, Margaret Hunter, campaigned on his behalf. On June 3, 2008 Duncan D. Hunter won 72% of the Republican Primary vote and became the Republican nominee to replace his father representing the 52nd District. Question: Had he ever lose a contest?. Whats the answer?","output":"Duncan Lee Hunter did not lose a contest for the House of Representatives, but he did lose the contest for the Republican Party nomination for President of the United States in 2008. Even though his campaign didn't attract many voters or delegates, he was successful in the House of Representatives elections, serving in Congress from 1981 to 2009."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It opens with a a fanciful depiction of angels in heaven discussing a problem that has come up. They are receiving prayers from mortals, like \\"Please, God, something's the matter with Daddy\\". George Bailey (James Stewart) is about to kill himself, and they need to send an angel down to Earth to stop him. They select Clarence (Henry Travers), a somewhat down-on-his-luck angel who hasn't earned his wings yet, but who they decide is right for the job. The senior angels promise that Clarence will get his wings if he succeeds. The bulk of the movie is a replaying of George's life, by the senior angels and for Clarence's benefit, so that Clarence will understand George.George Bailey was a young man, living in a small town, but with big dreams. From an early age, he wanted to get away from Bedford Falls, travel the world, and accomplish big things--planning cities and building huge airfields, skyscrapers, and bridges. The first incident that Clarence sees is that, at age 12, George saved his younger brother Harry's (Todd Karns) life in an accident while playing on an ice-covered pond. George lost the hearing in his left ear due to being in the icy water. Shortly after that, while working part-time in Mr. Gower's (H.B. Warner) drug store, he prevents a mistake in a prescription from fatally poisoning someone. The two little girls in George's life at that point are Mary Hatch (Donna Reed) and Violet Bick (Gloria Grahame), who seem to be competing for his notice.George's father (Samuel S. Hinds), with a small staff including Uncle Billy (Thomas Mitchell), run a small Building and Loan company that finances mortgages for the people of Bedford Falls. They face a difficult battle with the evil, avaricious, and wealthy Henry Potter (Lionel Barrymore). Potter is on the board of directors of the Building and Loan, holds much of its assets, along with almost everything else in town, charges people exorbitant rent on his own apartments,...

The softening of Scottish economic performance - much of it driven by the weakness in the oil and sector, though probably not all - has barely registered in the campaign. That may be because the worst appears to be over - or the best, if you're an oil consumer, and most of us are. The price per barrel of global benchmark Brent Crude ended April just above 47. Since dipping briefly below 30 in January, it has risen by nearly two-thirds. That sounds a lot. And it is. But it's worth remembering that the price is down by 30% on this time last year, and by 60% on its most recent peak, in June 2014. So what's going on, and what does it tell us about the future direction of travel? Last month saw members of OPEC, the cartel of major oil exporters, fail to agree on a way of limiting production so as to push prices up. It looks to some, such as Oxford Economics, as if the cartel is dead. Or like the Norwegian blue parrot, it's resting. That is partly because two big players, Saudi Arabia and Iran, have a growing regional rivalry. It is also because non-OPEC members have much more influence on prices than used to be the case. The price could have plummeted with that April failure to agree a freeze on production levels. But it didn't. It barely stumbled, and then continued its rising trend. Now, oil industry analysts are pointing to a continuing upside to the price. The boss of the International Energy Agency was the most recent to do so, commenting over the weekend. OPEC is next due to meet again in Vienna on June 2. But having ridden out the last failure to agree, and with prices rising despite that, there is less pressure to do a deal. The Saudis left little doubt that their decision in late 2014 to retain production levels in order to sustain market share was intended to drive their new US rivals out of production. Shale oil had followed on the shale gas boom in the USA. It helps explain why the country's crude oil production rose 57% between 2012 and 2015. But the nature of a shale well is that it depletes in up to a couple of years, and then the reservoir has to be re-fracked. There are only around half the shale rigs drilling in the US than there were a year ago. The low price has meant that it's not been worth going after more. Indeed, US shale drillers are in a lot of financial distress. Supply remains one million to two million barrels per day more than demand. The fall of US output should help ease back on that over-supply. It represents more than half of the 700,000 barrels per day decline in non-OPEC output expected this year. But America's frackers are ready to come back, if the price does. They will probably start doing so at around 55. The International Energy Agency estimates that Texas and the Dakotas kick back in at 60 to 65, and could then take a year or so to return to steady production. Before then, a rising price will lead to the release into the market of large stocks of oil that have been built up in the past 18 months. Commercial reserves in the OECD more developed nations, according to the International Energy Agency, stand at more than three billion barrels. That 60 to 70 range is seen as the most likely one for the price to stabilise, at least for a while. Back in the heart of OPEC, around the Persian Gulf, Iran is determined to ignore the cartel's pressure to keep total supply suppressed. Having been allowed to export since January, the Tehran government wants to get back to what it was producing before sanctions were imposed in 2011, and a bit more. It was then at 3.5m barrels per day, and according to industry analysis from Platt's consultancy, it's nearly back to that level. It has stated that it wants to average 4m barrels per day this year. Much of that is currently going to refineries in India and South Korea.  It has recently become easier to insure tankers sailing out of Iran, meaning it will play a more significant role in supplying Europe in coming months. That's out of more than 95 million barrels produced globally each day, more than 10m of them from Saudi Arabia. which is part of more than 32m from OPEC countries. That OPEC figure is reckoned by Reuters surveying to have crept up again in April, helping to explain a fall in price at the start of the first, low-volume trading day of May. (If it helps get a sense of scale, the UK's output of oil and its gas equivalent has risen recently to 1.5m barrels per day.) Iraq is also ramping up post-war production, reaching 4.16m barrels per day in March. But some other countries are seeing it fall. Nigeria has disruptions from vandalism and attacks on its infrastructure. Venezuela's economy is in dire straits and Libya faces a civil war, so both have seen output cut by a shortage of power necessary to operate production plants. Oil extraction requires a lot of energy. Then there's the demand side of the imbalance. Last year saw demand growth strengthen a bit, having dipped with the stalling of emerging market growth. A more recent analysis from the IEA suggests that it is continuing to rise to 1.2m barrels per day more this year. That's a slower rate of rise than the back end of 2015, as China, Europe and the US demand eases. But while it's rising, it helps close the gap between demand and supply and get the market more balanced again. And there's another factor - the mighty greenback. The US dollar has weakened by around 6% against a basket of currencies since the start of the year, and that helps drive up the cost of a dollar-denominated commodity. What about the longer term? In a brave bit of forecasting, Edinburgh-based Wood Mackenzie energy consultancy last week put out a warning of a huge, 4.5m barrels per day supply shortage. That, it suggested, could be with us in 2035. The reasoning for this is that the industry has become much less effective, or lucky, at finding new oil reserves. Even before the price slump cut exploration budgets by 40 to 50%, the annual discoveries of liquid reserves of hydrocarbons fell by roughly half between 2008 and 2015. The average year has seen around eight billion barrels of oil found.  Last year, it was less than three billion. A much harder calculation is how much demand there will be if the world's oil users are to meet their commitments to climate change targets. If governments are true to their word, with written agreement of the Paris accord signed in the past few days, and if technology helps renewable power replace fossil fuels, the oil market 19 years from now may look very different What is a summary of this text?","output":"In the oil industry, many factors are influencing the global market and future direction. The failure of OPEC to limit production and the rivalry between major players, such as Saudi Arabia and Iran, have led to less pressure to reach a deal. US shale production has played a significant role, with the nature of shale wells requiring re-fracking to maintain production levels. Supply remains higher than demand, and the decline in non-OPEC output is expected to ease, with US frackers returning to the market as oil prices rise. Large stocks of oil are built up and are likely to be released into the market as prices rise. The demand side of the equation has recently been influenced by the stalling of emerging market growth, and the weakening USD has driven up the cost of the dollar-denominated commodity. In the long term, the industry's ability to find new oil reserves has been less successful, and the commitment to climate change targets adds uncertainty to the future of oil markets. In summary, the oil industry faces numerous challenges and influences from both production and demand sides, with rivalries within OPEC, US shale production, weakening USD, and the global commitment to climate change creating an uncertain environment for the market."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The ballet instructor, a seasoned professional with years of experience both as a performer and educator, understands the intricacies and nuances of this traveling toe move, known as a bourrée in the ballet world. As the woman glides across the floor with a series of small, quick steps en pointe, or on her toes, the ballet instructor notices that she exhibits an elegant fluidity in her upper body. Her arms are gracefully extended, her fingers gently curved, creating an arch known as port de bras. He sees that the woman's shoulders are aligned with her hips, an essential element to maintain balance and control during the bourrée. However, the ballet instructor also notes a few areas in need of improvement. He observes that the woman's supporting leg must remain more engaged and stable to maintain her balance, while her Achilles tendons need to be stretched to achieve a fully pointed toe position. Her core muscles could be engaged more actively to provide additional support to her lower back throughout the demanding move. Once the woman has completed her demonstration of the traveling toe move, the ballet instructor provides his constructive feedback. He begins by commending her fluidity and the graceful lines she creates with her upper body. Encouraging her to continue developing this natural grace, he points out the specific areas and techniques that need refining. He offers advice on how to improve her foundational strength and balance, such as core exercises, resistance training, and alignment work. He suggests incorporating various stretches and mobility exercises to achieve a more extensive toe point and recommends practicing slow, controlled movements to strengthen and stabilize her supporting leg during the bourrée. Not only does the ballet instructor address these technical aspects of the traveling toe move, but he also emphasizes the importance of musicality and artistic expression. He advises the woman to be mindful of the musical phrasing and accents, using them to her advantage in perfecting her performance quality. Spending time on understanding intent, emotion, and storytelling is crucial when bringing a ballet piece to life, creating a connection with the audience and breathing life into every step. By providing comprehensive, thoughtful feedback and guidance, the ballet instructor supports the woman in honing her ballet skills and refining the traveling toe move technique. He highlights the need for consistent practice, dedication, and patience, ensuring that she keeps pushing her boundaries and perfecting her craft, regardless of her current proficiency level. The woman, in turn, appreciates the constructive feedback and remains committed to overcoming the challenges presented by ballet, working to embody grace, strength, and artistry in every move she masters."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

In the given context, the question asks how adverse weather conditions might affect the waiting time in line for passengers. The potential answers provided are A: more, B: less, and C: no effect. Between these choices, the most accurate answer is A: more. During bad weather conditions, flights may be delayed, canceled, or rescheduled. These changes can result in increased wait times at various stages of the travel process for passengers, including getting in line for check-in, boarding passes, security checkpoints, and boarding. These increased wait times can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, flight delays and cancellations can lead to confusion among passengers, as they try to understand the changes in their itineraries, seek information from airline representatives, or make alternative travel arrangements. This additional activity can cause congestion around the check-in and boarding pass kiosks and lead to longer lines for passengers. Secondly, when flights are delayed, passengers have to spend more time at the airport, waiting for updates and eventually boarding their flights. This can result in larger crowds at boarding gates and longer queues while boarding the aircraft. Additionally, airlines may have to handle multiple flights at the same time due to weather-related changes, leading to an increased workload for staff and longer wait times for passengers. Thirdly, in response to the weather conditions, airline and airport staff may implement additional safety and security measures, such as inspections of planes and airport facilities. These processes can take time and can further increase the waiting time for passengers. In conclusion, adverse weather conditions can significantly affect the waiting time for passengers at various stages of the travel process, often leading to increased wait times in line.

Tsukamoto started making movies at the age of 14, when his father gave him a Super 8 camera. His cinematic influences included Akira Kurosawa. He made a number of films, ranging from 10-minute shorts to 2-hour features, until his first year at college when he temporarily lost interest in making movies. Tsukamoto then started up a theatre group, which soon included Kei Fujiwara, Nobu Kanaoka, and Tomorowo Taguchi, all of whom would continue to work with Tsukamoto up through the filming of Tetsuo: The Iron Man.  - Kurosawa entered the Japanese film industry in 1936, following a brief stint as a painter. After years of working on numerous films as an assistant director and scriptwriter, he made his debut as a director in 1943, during World War II, with the popular action film \\"Sanshiro Sugata\\" (a.k.a. \\"Judo Saga\\"). After the war, the critically acclaimed \\"Drunken Angel\\" (1948), in which Kurosawa cast then-unknown actor Toshiro Mifune in a starring role, cemented the director's reputation as one of the most important young filmmakers in Japan.

It originates in the Rocky Mountains in western Montana, near the Yellowstone National Park. This river plays a significant role in the nation's history, as it was a principal part of the westward expansion of the United States. It served as a route for Native American tribes, explorers, fur trappers, traders, and settlers. The Missouri River flows through seven states: Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Iowa, Kansas, and Missouri, before joining the Mississippi River near St. Louis. Along the course of the river, several major cities are situated, such as Bismarck, Pierre, Sioux City, Omaha, and Kansas City. Aside from its historical importance, the Missouri River is also a vital source of water supply, hydroelectric power, and irrigation for the agricultural areas in the region. Efforts are being made to conserve and protect the river, as it is a crucial natural resource for local ecosystems and wildlife. 2. Mississippi River: The Mississippi River is the second longest river in the United States and one of the most famous rivers in the world. Its length is approximately 2,320 miles (3,730 kilometers), slightly shorter than the Missouri River. It flows from Lake Itasca in Minnesota and traverses through ten states; namely, Minnesota, Wisconsin, Iowa, Illinois, Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee, Arkansas, Mississippi, and Louisiana. This river also played an essential role in the history of the United States as a major transportation and trade route. The Mississippi River ends its course by emptying into the Gulf of Mexico. Along its journey, it passes through key cities such as Minneapolis, St. Paul, Quad Cities, St. Louis, Memphis, Baton Rouge, and New Orleans. The river is well-known for its cultural and historical importance, particularly in American literature and arts – reflected in works such as Mark Twain's \\"The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn.\\"  Mississippi River is highly important for commercial navigation, flood control, agriculture, and the regional ecosystem. It is home to a wide variety of aquatic and terrestrial species, and many wildlife refuges are scattered along its length. There are ongoing efforts to maintain its health and protect it from pollutants, sedimentation, and habitat destruction to maintain ecological balance and continued future utility. In summary, the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers are the two longest rivers in the United States, both vital and historically significant. They continue to have substantial economic, cultural, and ecological influence on the regions they pass through."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Title: 88 Minutes Movie plot: Forensic psychiatrist Dr. Jack Gramm (Al Pacino) testifies at the trial of suspected serial murderer Jon Forster (Neal McDonough), dubbed \\"The Seattle Slayer\\" by police. Gramm's testimony and expert psychiatric opinion are crucial to help convict Forster of the attempted killing of Janie Cates and the murder of Joanie Cates, who was drugged, hanged upside down, and killed after the killer broke into her home. After receiving his conviction by the jury, Forster taunts Gramm, saying \\"Tick-tock, Doc.\\" Nine years later, as Forster's execution date approaches, several similar torture murders with very similar circumstances occur. Gramm is questioned by a lawyer from the Attorney General's office as well as FBI Special Agent Frank Parks (William Forsythe) about his connection to the latest victim, Dale Morris, a former psychology student of Gramm's with whom he was at a party the night before, just hours before her death. On the way to his class, Gramm receives a phone call from someone using software to distort their voice, threatening he has 88 minutes to live. He later reports the call to his secretary Shelly (Amy Brenneman) and has her put together a risk assessment profile of potential perpetrators. Gramm receives another threatening phone call while teaching and becomes suspicious of his students, particularly Mike Stempt (Benjamin McKenzie).

Zakariya Essabar, a Moroccan citizen, moved to Germany in February 1997 and to Hamburg in 1998, where he studied medical technology. Soon after moving to Hamburg, Essabar met Binalshibh and the others through a Turkish mosque. Essabar turned extremist fairly suddenly, probably in 1999, and reportedly pressured one acquaintance with physical force to become more religious, grow a beard, and compel his wife to convert to Islam. Essabar's parents were said to have made repeated but unsuccessful efforts to sway him from this lifestyle. Shortly before the 9/11 attacks, he would travel to Afghanistan to communicate the date for the attacks to the al Qaeda leadership. Mounir el Motassadeq, another Moroccan, came to Germany in 1993, moving to Hamburg two years later to study electrical engineering at theTechnical University. A witness has recalled Motassadeq saying that he would kill his entire family if his religious beliefs demanded it. One of Motassadeq's roommates recalls him referring to Hitler as a \\"good man\\" and organizing film sessions that included speeches by  Bin Laden. Motassadeq would help conceal the Hamburg group's trip to Afghanistan in late 1999. Abdelghani Mzoudi, also a Moroccan, arrived in Germany in the summer of 1993, after completing university courses in physics and chemistry. Mzoudi studied in Dortmund, Bochum, and Muenster before moving to Hamburg in 1995. Mzoudi described himself as a weak Muslim when he was home in Morocco, but much more devout when he was back in Hamburg. In April 1996, Mzoudi and Motassadeq witnessed the execution of Atta's will. During the course of 1999, Atta and his group became ever more extreme and secretive, speaking only in Arabic to conceal the content of their conversations. 87 When the four core members of the Hamburg cell left Germany to journey to Afghanistan late that year, it seems unlikely that they already knew about the planes operation; no evidence connects them to al Qaeda before that time. Witnesses have attested, however, that their pronouncements reflected ample predisposition toward taking some action against the United States. In short, they fit the bill for  Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM.

His parents were of Bulgarian and Polish descent. His nickname growing up was \\"Dede\\". As a child, he displayed symptoms of his gigantism very early, reaching a height of 191 cm (6 ft 3 in) and a weight of 94 kg (208 lb) by the age of 12. Andre returned in the winter of 1990, but it was not to the World Wrestling Federation. Instead, Andre made an interview appearance for Herb Abrams' fledgling Universal Wrestling Federation on October 11th in Reseda, California. (the segment aired in 1991). He appeared in an interview segment with Captain Lou Albano and put over the UWF. The following month, on November 30th at a house show in Miami, Florida the World Wrestling Federation announced Andre's return as a participant in the 1991 Royal Rumble (to be held in Miami, FL two months later). Andre was also mentioned as a participant on television but would ultimately back out due to a leg injury.  His on-air return finally came at WrestleMania VII, when he came to the aid of The Big Boss Man in his match against Mr. Perfect. Andre finally returned to action on April 26, 1991, in a six-man tag-team matchup when he teamed with the Rockers in a winning effort against Mr. Fuji and the Orient Express at a house show in Belfast, Northern Ireland. On May 10th he participated in a 17-man battle-royal at a house show in Detroit. (won by Kerry Von Erich). His last major WWF storyline following WrestleMania VII had the major heel managers (Bobby Heenan, Sensational Sherri, Slick, and Mr. Fuji) trying to recruit Andre one-by-one, only to be turned down in various humiliating ways (e.g. Heenan had his hand crushed, Sherri received a spanking, Slick got locked in the trunk of the car he was offering to Andre and Mr. Fuji got a pie in his face). Finally, Jimmy Hart appeared live on WWF Superstars to announce that he had successfully signed Andre to tag-team with Earthquake. However, when asked to confirm this by Gene Okerlund, Andre denied the claims. This led to Earthquake's attacking Andre from behind (injuring his knee). Jimmy Hart would later get revenge for the humiliation by secretly signing Tugboat and forming the Natural Disasters. This led to Andre's final major WWF appearance at SummerSlam '91, where he seconded the Bushwhackers in their match against the Disasters. Andre was on crutches at ringside, and after the Disasters won the match, they set out to attack Andre, but the Legion of Doom made their way to ringside and got in between them and the Giant, who was preparing to defend himself with one of his crutches. The Disasters left the ringside area as they were outnumbered by the Legion of Doom, the Bushwhackers and Andre, who struck both Earthquake and Typhoon (the former Tugboat) with the crutch as they left. His final WWF appearance came at a house show in Paris, France, on October 9. He was in Davey Boy Smith's corner as the Bulldog faced Earthquake. Davey Boy hit Earthquake with Andre's crutch, allowing Smith to win.  His last U.S. television appearance was in a brief interview on World Championship Wrestling's (WCW) Clash of the Champions XX special that aired on TBS on 2 September 1992.

Write some highlights for the following article: What was supposed to be a straightforward cash deal to carry a child for desperate parents has turned into an international spat over who said what, and exposed the darker side of a business credited with creating happiness for many couples. At the center of the debate is Gammy, a seven-month-old Down Syndrome baby with a congenital heart condition who is currently receiving treatment for a lung infection at a private hospital in Thailand. For days, Gammy's surrogate mother, 21-year-old Thai food stall worker Pattharamon Chanbua, has been telling local and foreign press that the couple abandoned their son, taking home his healthy sister. After initially denying they knew about baby Gammy, a friend of the couple issued a statement to a local Australian newspaper saying the pair only left Gammy because they were told he was likely to die. \\"Gammy was very sick when he was born and the biological parents were told he would not survive and he had a day, at best, to live and to say goodbye,\\" the unnamed friend told the Bunbury Mail, in Western Australia, where the couple live. Fear and lies. The friend said the surrogate mother gave birth at a different hospital to the one agreed upon, which made the surrogacy agreement void. The couple was scared, she said, that Pattharamon would change her mind about the second child, and they'd have to leave Thailand with no children at all. According to the report, the friend noted that the backdrop to the surrogacy row was a military coup in the country and \\"it was very difficult to get around.\\" The takeover took place in the early hours of May 22, 2014 when Commander of the Royal Thai Army General Prayuth Chan-chua announced in a national broadcast he was now in charge. \\"This has been absolutely devastating for them, they are on the edge,\\" the friend added, referring to the days of media scrutiny and debate over their decision, months after they returned home. Pattharamon claimed the couple asked her to terminate the Down Syndrome child when she was seven months pregnant. Not true, the couple's friend said. After the babies' birth, Pattharamon claimed they bought nappies and milk for the baby girl, but \\"didn't even look at the boy.\\" Also a lie, the friend added. Whatever the details of who said what, the case has attracted attention to a largely unregulated industry subject to a confusing tangle of laws and loopholes. Surrogate 'is legal parent' In the state of Western Australia, where the couple is from, it's legal to seek surrogacy abroad. There are no checks for criminal history, and no counseling is required for couples seeking offshore surrogacy, said Jenni Millbank, an expert in Australian surrogacy law from the University of Technology in Sydney. \\"If surrogacy were taken onshore there would be counseling protocols prior to conception, as well as a welfare report after birth required before legal parentage is transferred; but these are not steps that occur with offshore surrogacy,\\" said Millbank. She said the surrogate mother is the legal parent regardless of whose egg was used. The rights of the genetic father are also \\"uncertain\\" as \\"different judges have taken varied approaches,\\" she said. Australian authorities are looking into the case, as are Thai authorities, who had already announced a crackdown on the industry amid claims rules were being flouted. Pattharamon said she agreed to be paid 300,000 baht (9,300) for carrying the couple's babies, money she needed to help care for her own two children, aged six and three. After she voiced concerns about how she was going to pay for Gammy's care, funds started flowing to an online campaign, which to date has raised more than 237,000 (US220,000). Could baby girl be returned? Pattharamon said she's prepared to take the baby girl back if the Australian couple is are \\"not ready\\" to take care of her. She said she doesn't intend to pursue legal action against the parents, though Millbank says she could apply to the Family Court of Australia to have the child returned. \\"The Family Court of Australia has jurisdiction over anyone who has an interest in the care, welfare and a development of a child so (the intending parents) could still make their case and argue for the baby to live with them,\\" Millbank said. \\"The court would examine the competitive proposals of the parties, probably appoint an independent children's lawyer and do a welfare assessment of the child's needs and then make a decision.\\" The Australian courts have only ever heard one case involving a child born via surrogacy, Millbank said. It involved a child called \\"Evelyn\\" whose birth was the result of an agreement between friends that went wrong. \\"That was in the 1980s and they ended up removing the child from the family that had been raising her and taking her to the other family,\\" Millbank said. \\"It was an altruistic arrangement where the birth mother changed her mind about seven months later. And she ultimately won. She got the child back.\\"","output":"A baby named Gammy was born with Down Syndrome and a heart condition to a Thai surrogate mother named Pattharamon. The biological parents, a couple from Australia, brought home Gammy's twin sister but left Gammy behind. At first, the couple claimed they did not know about Gammy, but later a friend said they believed he would die. This situation has raised questions about surrogacy laws and the care of children born with disabilities. Both Australian and Thai authorities are investigating the case. There has been a lot of debate and confusion about what really happened, but many people have donated money to help Gammy receive the medical care he needs."},{"instruction":"Given the background: Making these healthy lifestyle choices can also help prevent some types of cancer.

Please share my name and email address with Halloween & Costume Association, so that I can receive updates on this campaign and others. ||||| This year trick-or-treaters will dress up and go door to door on Wednesday, October 31, but a controversial petition wants to change that plan. The Halloween & Costume Organization just launched a campaign to move Halloween to the last Saturday of October, and lots of families have already hopped on board.      The trade group argues that a weekend celebration would allow for greater parental supervision and child safety by trick-or-treating during daylight hours — not to mention more time to celebrate without the stress of the work or school week.      \\"We feel the change is inevitable and that in the end, the logic behind creating a safer, longer Halloween will prevail,\\" HCA Chairman Kevin Johnson said in a statement. So far the group's efforts have garnered more than 900 signatures on Change.org.      The holiday's fixed date stems from its religious origins in the eighth century, when Pope Gregory III declared November 1 as a day to honor all saints. A tradition then developed to celebrate the dead on the preceding night, which later became what we know today as Halloween.      Despite its religious roots, most Americans currently treat October 31 as a commercial holiday — and some parents think moving it to a Saturday would make life a lot easier for them and their kids. Let's start by breaking down the positives, shall we?      The Pros            It's easier for parents to celebrate with their kids versus rushing home after work.      Children could trick-or-treat during daylight hours when it's potentially safer.      You could spend the whole day celebrating instead of a few hours at night.      Kids can still get a good night's sleep after staying out late.      The Cons      But before we do anything too crazy, don't forget:      The U.S. has celebrated Halloween on October 31st since the mid-19th century.      Halloween literally means \\"All Hallows' Eve\\" — a.k.a. the night before November 1.      Half the fun of Halloween as kid is staying up late on a school night.      You just can't mess with tradition!      So there you have it. Fair warning though: Right now the government does not recognize Halloween as a federal holiday, so not only would Congress have to pass a law adding it to the official calendar, but they'd also have to agree on when to celebrate it. Getting any kind of consensus out of Washington right now is a lot easier said than done, but if you really love Halloween, it might be worth a shot. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"The Halloween & Costume Association has launched a campaign to move Halloween from October 31st to the last Saturday of October, arguing that a weekend celebration would allow for greater parental supervision, child safety, and more time to celebrate without the stress of work or school.

Jack, grief-stricken, goes on an alcoholic bender, leaving his daughter to be taken care of by his parents and Sarah's mother, until they decide to take drastic action: they return the baby to Jack whilst he is asleep, leaving him to take care of it. Although he struggles initially, he eventually begins to dote on the child and names her Sarah. Despite this, he nevertheless finds it increasingly difficult to juggle bringing up the baby with his high-powered job, and though both sets of the child's grandparents lend a hand (along with William, a dried out ex-alcoholic who, once sober, proves to be a remarkably efficient babysitter and housekeeper), he needs more help. Amy, an American waitress he meets in a restaurant who takes a shine to Sarah, takes up the role as nanny, moving in with Jack after one meeting.

George Bailey (James Stewart) is about to kill himself, and they need to send an angel down to Earth to stop him. They select Clarence (Henry Travers), a somewhat down-on-his-luck angel who hasn't earned his wings yet, but who they decide is right for the job. The senior angels promise that Clarence will get his wings if he succeeds. The bulk of the movie is a replaying of George's life, by the senior angels and for Clarence's benefit, so that Clarence will understand George.George Bailey was a young man, living in a small town, but with big dreams. From an early age, he wanted to get away from Bedford Falls, travel the world, and accomplish big things--planning cities and building huge airfields, skyscrapers, and bridges.

Luckily, a chance camp up to him. A company wanted to employ one person. He and the other twenty people joined in the first interview. After that, three persons were allowed to enter the final test which would decide one person to be employed in the end. Bill was lucky to be among them. On the day of the second interview, Bill and the others arrived at the company on time. To their surprise, the interview was very easy. The interviewer only had a free talk with them, and then asked them to go back home waiting for the result. The next morning, Bill received a letter from the company which said he wasn't accepted. Certainly, he felt disappointed. On the evening of that day, Bill surprisingly received another letter, which said he was employed. But why was he accepted? As a matter of fact, the first letter sent to Bill was also part of the test. Every one of them got a letter which had the same meaning that morning. Only Bill replied with \\"Thank you\\" while the others said nothing. Life isn't all fun. There is always something making us unhappy. When you feel disappointed, please say \\"Thank you\\" to the person who disappoints you. That shows your great generosity  and politeness to others.

Find the right ending to this passage. By Louise Boyle Kato Kaelin, the bit-part actor who became famous overnight as OJ Simpson's house-guest at the time of his ex-wife's murder, has revealed that OJ tried to persuade him to provide an alibi for that fatal night 20 years ago. On the 20th anniversary of the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ron Goldman, Kaelin spoke to Today along with the father and sister of Mr Goldman. The pair were found brutally stabbed to death at Ms Brown Simpson's LA home on June 12, 1994. Kaelin was staying in a guest house at OJ Simpson's compound and was present at the time the murders took place. He appeared as a prosecution witness at OJ's murder trial before a rapt but unforgiving public where he was criticized for his rambling, arrogant testimony and dubbed a 'beach bum' and 'parasitic freeloader'. Nicole Brown-","output":"Simpson's brutal murder, along with that of her friend Ron Goldman, will forever remain etched in public memory as one of the most shocking and tragic events of the 20th century. The events of that fateful night, as well as the ensuing murder trial, captivated the attention of millions and marked an indelible turning point in the lives of all those involved. Kato Kaelin's association with OJ Simpson and his presence during the time of the murders made him a key figure in the investigation and the subsequent trial. As he spoke to Today, Kaelin was open about the burden that his newfound fame placed on him and the emotional toll he suffered. Kaelin revealed that OJ Simpson had tried to convince him to provide a false alibi for the night of the murders. Despite the pressure, Kaelin decided not to comply with Simpson's request as he realized the significance of the testimony he would have to give at the trial. He was determined to tell the truth, even if it meant putting his own safety and reputation at stake. Over the years, Kato Kaelin has been criticized for his attitude in the courtroom and labeled as a 'beach bum' and 'parasitic freeloader'. However, his decision to stand up against OJ's manipulative tactics showed immense courage and dedication to seeking justice for Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman. As the Today interview continued, the father and sister of Ron Goldman, Fred and Kim, expressed their gratitude to Kato Kaelin for his candid remarks and his unwavering commitment to bringing closure to their family. The Goldmans acknowledged that they would never have known the truth about what happened that horrifying night without Kaelin's willingness to share his story. Twenty years after the murders, the cloud of suspicion and controversy that surrounded OJ Simpson's trial remains as potent as ever. Yet, in the midst of this unresolved pain and tumult, Kato Kaelin stands out as a figure who chose to put truth and accountability above self-preservation and convenience. As the interview concluded, it was strikingly evident that the lives of those touched by the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman have remained forever altered. The tragedy has come to define them in different ways, shaping the paths they have chosen to take in their search for justice and closure. Kato Kaelin's unwavering dedication to fulfill his responsibilities as a witness and his refusal to provide a false alibi for OJ Simpson continue to remind the world of the darker side of celebrity and the lengths some individuals will go in order to preserve their image and public standing. And although the ending of this tragic tale is marred with pain, disillusionment, and loss, Kato Kaelin's courage and integrity hold out a glimmer of hope that, in the midst of darkness, the pursuit of truth and justice can still prevail."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Connect the HDMI-A plug into a port on the TV. Connect the other end of the cable to the device or adapter. Switch to the HDMI source on your TV. Hook up the audio separately if necessary.\\"","output":"Title: The Comprehensive Guide to HDMI Connection on Non-HDMI Devices In today’s rapidly evolving digital world, HDMI (High-Definition Multimedia Interface) has emerged as the near-ubiquitous standard for audio and video transmission. This powerful one-cable solution has largely simplified our home and work theatres, gaming systems, and PC monitors. However, what if you have a non-HDMI device that you wish to connect to your HDMI-equipped TV or monitor? The following is a detailed guide to establishing an HDMI connection on tech gadgets that don't inherently support it. To start, you must first identify an HDMI-compatible port on your non-HDMI gadget. Often, the key lies in understanding the port options available on your specific device. For monitors, computers, or similar devices, options might include DVI (Digital Visual Interface), VGA (Video Graphics Array), or DisplayPort ports. In the case of gaming consoles or DVD players, you could discover ports such as SCART or Component Video. The goal is to identify the highest quality output port available. Typically, an HDMI-compatible port is one that can transfer both audio and video signals, although this doesn’t strictly have to be the case. Once you’ve identified a potential port, the next step is choosing the correct cable or adapter. An adapter or converter will be required to change the signal from your device into one that can be read by your HDMI TV or monitor. These are available in various forms such as DVI-to-HDMI or VGA-to-HDMI, each tailored to specific connection needs. Besides, there are even multi-adapters available that can cover a range of different port types. When purchasing a cable or adapter, it is essential to ensure that it matches the port on your device.  Next, you will connect the HDMI-A plug into a port on the TV. HDMI-A is the standard plug type, identifiable by its trapezoid shape. Most HDTVs and monitors are equipped with an HDMI-A port, making it a universal solution. Always insert the plug carefully to avoid damaging the pins. The fourth step is to connect the other end of the cable or adapter to the device in question. This can range from a VGA port on a projector to a DVI port on a computer monitor. Again, ensure that the connections are secure to guarantee a clear signal. Following this, you must switch the TV or monitor to the right HDMI source. When the device is connected via HDMI, it may take a moment for the TV to detect the new input. Once the connection is established, navigate to your TV settings and select the relevant HDMI input (for instance, HDMI 1, HDMI 2, and so forth) as the source. Finally, because older technology devices or analog ones might not transmit audio over HDMI, hooking up the audio connection separately may be necessary. A typical method involves using a separate audio cable which connects the audio output of the device to the audio input of your TV or speaker system. Typically, a 3.5mm audio cable or RCA audio cable is commonly used for this purpose.  To summarize, while it may seem challenging at first, establishing an HDMI connection on non-HDMI devices involves a series of straightforward steps. By identifying an HDMI-compatible port, choosing the right cable, and correctly establishing the connection, you can enjoy high-quality audio and video on your HDMI-ready TV or monitor from various devices, irrespective of their native support for HDMI. Remember, when you encounter any challenges, the user manuals or online forums related to your specific device can be crucial tools in troubleshooting any issues. However, with careful attention to each step, you'll be able to effectively connect and enjoy your non-HDMI devices to the full."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I thought I would share some experiences, observations, and recommendations based upon when I did this previously in my career. Back in 2004 I was peddling my wares as a journalist, writing for the tech press. I was living in the West Midlands in England and heard about a new organization in nearby Birmingham called OpenAdvantage. The premise was neat: open source was becoming a powerful force in technology and OpenAdvantage was set up to provide free consultancy for companies wanting to harness open source, as well as individuals who wanted to upskill in these new technologies. At the time in the West Midlands lots of industry was being automated and moved out to Asia, so lots of Midlanders were out of jobs and looking to retrain. This required, by definition, retaining the workforce as knowledge workers. OpenAdvantage was funded by the UK government and the University of Central England, had a decent war chest, and was founded by Scott Thompon and Paul Cooper (the latter of which I met when he heckled me at a talk I gave at a Linux User Group once. 🙂 ) So, I went along to their launch event and wrote a piece about them. Shortly after, Paul and Scott invited me back over to the office and offered me a job there as an open source consultant. I took the role, and this is where I cut my teeth on a lot of open source, community, and working with businesses. We had crazy targets to hit each month, so we ended up working with and training hundreds of organizations and individuals across a wide range of areas, and covering a wide berth of open source...

Availability: Sporting goods stores typically stock a wide range of sports equipment and accessories, including items related to ice hockey, such as pucks, sticks, and protective gear. Therefore, a person is likely to find a puck available for purchase at a sporting goods store. 2. Variety: A sporting goods store generally offers a variety of pucks in terms of brands, sizes, and materials. This allows customers to choose the ideal puck that caters to their needs, preferences, skill levels, and budgets. 3. Quality: Sporting goods stores often carry products from reputable manufacturers and brands, ensuring that customers can purchase high-quality pucks that would last longer and perform better than cheaper, lower-quality alternatives. 4. Expertise: The staff at sporting goods stores usually possess knowledge about the sports products they sell, so a human looking to purchase a hockey puck may receive useful advice on which one to buy based on their requirements. This can be especially helpful for beginners who may not be well-versed in picking the right puck. 5. Convenience: Sporting goods stores tend to be more accessible than other suggested options. While hockey rinks, arcades, ice hockey games, and locker rooms might have pucks, it may not be convenient or easy to acquire them in these locations. Additionally, these locations might not always permit individuals to take home a puck. 6. New and unused products: Buying a puck from a sporting goods store ensures that the product is brand new and hasn't been used previously. On the other hand, pucks found at a hockey rink, arcade, ice hockey game, or locker room might be used, damaged, or even unsanitary, which might not be desirable for those looking to take a puck home.

Summarize this article: Drugs and weapons charges take precedence over Los Angeles killing in move that could give Durst’s lawyers time to fight basis of his arrest on murder charges      Robert Durst’s extradition to California to face first-degree murder charges will be postponed at least until next week because authorities in New Orleans, where he was arrested on Saturday, want to pursue their own lesser charges against him first.            Orleans Parish magistrate Harry Cantrell on Tuesday set a bail hearing for next Monday regarding an illegal weapons charge – Durst had a revolver on him when he was detained in the lobby of a Marriott hotel – and a second count of marijuana possession.      Robert Durst: police search Houston apartment in murder case Read more      Those charges pale in comparison to the killing of Durst’s friend Susan Berman, who was gunned down in her home in Los Angeles two days before Christmas in 2000. Berman’s is one of three mysterious deaths that Durst, the one-time heir to a New York real estate fortune, has been close to over the past 33 years. Durst was officially charged on Monday with her murder.            It was not immediately clear why New Orleans wanted to pursue its own case against Durst, but the unexpected hold-up offered an opening for Durst’s team of attorneys.      They have already been on warpath over The Jinx, the documentary series that appears to have played a significant role – disputed by the LAPD – in breaking open the dormant investigation into Berman’s killing and featured a possible confession from Durst in its concluding episode, which aired on Sunday.      Durst’s lead attorney, Dick DeGuerin, told reporters on the courthouse steps in New Orleans that he would take advantage of the delay in extradition proceedings to fight the basis of Durst’s arrest even before he leaves Louisiana.      “My concern is that the warrant that was issued in California was issued because of a television show and not because of facts,” DeGuerin said. “We’re going to get to contest that warrant here in Louisiana because of the Louisiana authorities’ determining to file charges here.”      While legal experts said it was extremely unlikely that Durst could see the charges dropped before being extradited – an extradition his lawyers have already said he will not contest – DeGuerin seemed to relish the opportunity to give his defence strategy a dress rehearsal and accuse his adversaries of letting a television programme dictate what 15 years of inconclusive police investigation could not.      “His arrest,” DeGuerin said, “is not based on facts. It’s based on ratings.”      The Los Angeles police department has already hit back against the notion that the arrest was timed to coincide with the airing of the documentary. Their version of events is that they have built a case against Durst based on months of renewed investigation. “We didn’t base anything we did on the HBO series,” the LAPD deputy chief Kirk Albanese told the Los Angeles Times. “The arrest was made as a result of the investigative efforts and at a time that we believe it was needed.”      The producers of The Jinx have denied they had any deal with law enforcement or that they knew when Durst’s arrest was coming. Nobody has produced evidence to the contrary.      Questions have been raised, however, over the timeline of events as presented in the last episode of The Jinx.      In a dramatic final interview for the show, Durst was presented with an envelope he had addressed to Susan Berman which bore many similarities to an anonymous note mailed to the Beverly Hills police on the day of Berman’s murder. Durst at first acknowledged the similarity but denied being the killer.      He then went to the bathroom with his microphone still switched on, and in a conversation to himself appeared to suggest the jig was up. “What a disaster,” he said. “What the hell did I do? Killed them all, of course.”      Andrew Jarecki, the director of the documentary, has already faced questions about how long he waited before handing over the envelope and the audio recording in the bathroom to police. He acknowledged in an interview with CBS – one of his only interviews since the finale aired – that there was a delay of several months but said that was because it took that long for his team to stumble on the bathroom audio for themselves.      Now there appears to be a separate problem of presentation in the documentary itself. The final episode strongly suggested the interview occurred in the autumn of 2013 and that Durst, having resisted being reinterviewed, finally consented because he needed the film-makers’ help in a legal spat with his brother. But the New York Times has reported for two days now that according to its sources the interview occurred as long as 18 months previously.      This is the kind of inconsistency that, if proven correct, defence lawyers feast on. It is already doubtful whether Durst’s bathroom ramblings constitute a confession that can stand up in court – one law professor, Laurie Levenson of Loyola Law School Los Angeles, said it was not a confession but a “reckless statement”. If DeGuerin can show there are other problems with it, he may seek to undermine its reliability further.      Jarecki and his producing partner, Marc Smerling, ducked the timeline question in an interview with the New York Times published on Monday and then cancelled a slew of other interviews. They put out a statement saying it was no longer appropriate to speak to the media because they could be called as witnesses if Durst goes to trial for the murder of Susan Berman.            HBO, meanwhile, would not answer questions from the Guardian about when they did a deal with Jarecki and Smerling and when it was decided to do the documentary in six parts – questions that might clarify when the film-makers knew how good their material was going to be. HBO said only that “we believe the relevant information was turned over to the authorities in a timely and responsible manner”.       ||||| AP Karen Mitchell of Eureka, Calif., was last seen Nov. 25, 1997. Robert Durst may be connected to her disappearance, police said. Enlarge FBI 18-year-old Kristen Modafferi disappeared after leaving work in San Francisco on June 23, 1997. Robert Durst was said to be living in the area at the time. Enlarge      Two teenage girls who went missing in California 18 years ago could come back to haunt Robert Durst.      Detectives searching for Karen Mitchell and Kristen Modafferi took a look at the mysterious Manhattan real estate scion back in 2003 when he was on trial in Galveston, Tex., for murdering and dismembering his neighbor.      Now that Durst will soon be heading back to Los Angeles to face a charge of murdering old friend Susan Berman in 2000, the search for 16-year-old Mitchell is back on the front burner, said an author who has covered Durst for years.      “Karen Mitchell's family spoke with the FBI as recently as a few months ago,” said Matt Birkbeck, who wrote \\"A Deadly Secret: The Strange Disappearance of Kathie Durst.\\" “They brought up Durst.”      Kathie Durst was the cross-dressing multimillionaire’s first wife, who vanished in 1982.      Humboldt County District Attorney Maggie Fleming declined to discuss Durst or the Mitchell case.      “I really can't confirm or deny that Durst is a person of interest because anything said about the investigation could potentially hinder the investigation,” she said.      Gerald Herbert/AP Robert Durst is escorted into Orleans Parish Prison after his arraignment in Orleans Parish Criminal District Court in New Orleans on Tuesday.      Modafferi’s dad said he hasn’t heard from the feds recently about his daughter, who was 18 when she vanished while visiting San Francisco. So he is reaching out to them.      “The Durst news has created enough of a question mark in my mind that I'm going to follow up with the FBI,” Bob Modafferi said. “If he was in that area where Kirsten went missing, it raises a bunch of potential red flags and questions.”      Mitchell, who vanished on Nov. 25, 1997, volunteered at a homeless shelter in Eureka, Calif., where Durst had been spotted, Birkbeck said.      Police said that after leaving the shelter, Mitchell walked over to the Bayshore Mall and visited her aunt, Annie Casper, at her shoe store.      Then Mitchell left for her aunt’s home — and has not been seen since.      Durst lived in the nearby town of Trinidad at the time and visited Casper’s store — while dressed in drag — at least four times, Birkbeck said.      Investigators also looked at Durst in connection with Modafferi, a college student from North Carolina who went missing on June 23, 1997, Birkbeck said.      “The investigators told me that one of the suspects they were looking at had dressed in drag, he had some odd habits,” he said, referring to the Mitchell case. “After I finished the interview, I mentioned that I covered Robert Durst, who also dressed in drag. They wrote his name down and then I discovered he was living in San Francisco at the time. The police just jumped on it. They started putting pieces together.”      Bob Modafferi, 66, of Charlotte, N.C. confirmed that cops went “down that road to see if there was anything to it.”      “They did not indicate to us there’s anything there,” he said. “As time goes on, realistically the hope starts to dim, but it never dies out completely. There are cases you hear about that finally have a break. We will never lose faith or give up hope.”      Durst’s lawyers have said they know nothing about Mitchell or Modafferi and deny he had anything to do with Berman’s murder or Kathie Durst’s disappearance.      Durst was acquitted of killing neighbor Morris Black, even though he admitted chopping up his body.      rblau@nydailynews.com ||||| HOUSTON (AP) — Authorities on Tuesday carried away two boxes after searching the Houston home of real estate millionaire Robert Durst after his weekend arrest in New Orleans on a murder warrant.

(Associated Press)      Durst, 71, is charged with murder in a killing in California 15 years ago, and has been suspected — but never charged — in the disappearance of his first wife in New York. In 2003, he was acquitted of murder in a dismemberment death in Texas. His arrest in New Orleans came shortly before the finale of an HBO series about his links to the three killings.      Seven officers spent hours Tuesday searching Durst's home in a 17-story condominium building in a posh Houston neighborhood. About 8:30 p.m. the officers, including one wearing a Los Angeles Police Department badge, carried two white cardboard document boxes to six vehicles and left.      The officers declined to comment, except for one who confirmed they were done.      FBI spokeswoman Shauna Dunlap confirmed that FBI agents participated in the operation at the request of the Los Angeles Police Department. Harris County district attorney's office spokesman Jeff McShan said the Los Angeles Police Department contacted his office last week.      Neither Dunlap nor McShan would elaborate on what was happening inside the building and referred questions to Los Angeles police.      LAPD spokesman Sgt. Barry Montgomery said the department is not commenting until Durst is in its custody. Durst is being held in Louisiana, where he faces drug and weapons charges, and it's not clear how soon he will be returned to California.      \\"This is an investigation that's being handled by multi-jurisdictions,\\" Montgomery said. \\"At this juncture the only thing the LAPD is doing is waiting for the extradition. We are just waiting on him to make it into our custody.\\"      Durst, 71, was charged Monday in Los Angeles with first-degree murder in the shooting of Susan Berman, his confidante and the daughter of a prominent Las Vegas mobster, in Beverly Hills. He could face the death penalty under special circumstances that allege he ambushed her and murdered a witness to a crime.      Dick DeGuerin, Durst's longtime Houston defense attorney, said he was baffled by what investigators could be looking for in the condo building.      \\"I think it's a publicity stunt. I'm not surprised by it, but I would really be surprised if they found anything of any evidentiary value,\\" he said.      In the documentary \\"The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst\\" that just wrapped up, Durst mumbled about how he \\"killed them all,\\" providing a dramatic kick to the end of the series. But a law enforcement official said his arrest on the murder charge was based on words he wrote.      Analysis linked a letter Durst wrote to Berman a year before her killing with one that pointed police to her body, and that was the key new evidence in the long-dormant investigation into the 2000 killing, the official not authorized to speak publicly told The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity because the investigation was ongoing.      Bob Martin, who has lived with his wife, Carol, in the Houston building for 1 ½ years, said he would occasionally say hello to Durst and discuss the real estate market with him. He described Durst as no quirkier than anyone else in the building. He added that Durst would occasionally attend the building's homeowners' association meetings and that the building staff reported Durst was courteous to them, as well.      Durst waived extradition in New Orleans, but authorities there charged him with being a felon in possession of a gun and with having marijuana. Assistant District Mark Burton said investigators found more than a quarter-pound of pot and a revolver in his hotel room.      DeGuerin said he wants a hearing in Louisiana as soon as possible to contest the arrest.      \\"The warrant we believe is based on a television show and not on actual fact,\\" he said. \\"We want a hearing as quickly as possible so Mr. Durst can go to California and face trial as quickly as possible.\\"      The judge in New Orleans scheduled another hearing for next Monday.      ___      Associated Press writers Tami Abdollah and Brian Melley in Los Angeles, Janet McConnaughey in New Orleans and Emily Wagster in Jackson, Miss., contributed to this report. ||||| Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.      / Updated By Andrew Blankstein      A California police department is interested in speaking with the law enforcement agencies that have investigated New York real-estate heir Robert Durst in connection with a teenage girl who went missing in the late 90s, police told NBC News on Tuesday.      Eureka Police Department Chief Andy Mills said Tuesday that he would like to talk to investigators who have dug into Durst’s past in connection with the disappearance of Karen Mitchell, who was 16 when she went missing from Eureka, California, in 1997.      \\"We believe she met foul play but we do not know that for sure,\\" Mills told NBC News, adding that they would like to learn more about when Durst was in Eureka.      But Mills was clear to point out that the department has not made any sort of definitive, direct link between the Mitchell case and Durst.      “I caution people about reaching too far too quickly,�? he said.      Durst was charged Monday in Los Angeles with the 2000 murder of his close friend Susan Berman, who investigators say may have been a witness to an earlier crime.      Police on Tuesday searched the Houston home of the millionaire, leaving Durst's home in a 17-story condominium building at about 8:30 p.m. and carrying two white cardboard document boxes, The Associated Press reported. One of the officers was wearing a Los Angeles Police Department badge. They declined to comment to the AP.      Harris County district attorney's office spokesman Jeff McShan told the AP he was contacted by the Los Angeles Police Department last week, but he wouldn’t elaborate further.      Durst was also questioned in the 1982 disappearance of his wife, Kathleen, and admitted to shooting and dismembering a neighbor in 2001, but was acquitted on a self-defense claim.      Durst was caught on a microphone while filming the HBO documentary \\"The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst\\" saying: \\"What the hell did I do? Killed them all, of course.\\" The bombshell sound bite aired during the finale of the documentary Sunday.      Durst's lawyer, Dick DeGuerin, told reporters after a court hearing Tuesday that he was worried \\"that the warrant that was issued in California was issued because of a television show and not because of facts.\\"      \\"Bob Durst did not kill Susan Berman. He doesn't know who did,\\" DeGuerin said.      Los Angeles Deputy Police Chief Kirk Albanese said the timing of the arrest had nothing to do with the HBO show and that investigators were concerned that Durst might flee the country.      \\"We do police work based on the facts and evidence,\\" Albanese told the Associated Press on Monday. \\"I know there's lots of speculation about that. It had nothing to do with the show.\\"      Karen Mitchell missingkids.com      IN-DEPTH      — with Elisha Fieldstadt |||||","output":"Robert Durst's extradition to California to face first-degree murder charges has been postponed due to authorities in New Orleans wanting to pursue their own lesser charges against him first. Durst was arrested in New Orleans for illegal weapons charges and marijuana possession. This delay in extradition could potentially give Durst's lawyers time to contest the basis of his arrest on the murder charges. In 2000, Durst's friend Susan Berman was murdered in Los Angeles, and Durst has faced allegations that he was involved in her death. These allegations resurfaced recently due to the HBO documentary series, The Jinx, which explored Durst's connections to the murders. Durst's lead attorney, Dick DeGuerin, is concerned that the arrest warrant for the murder charge in California was issued because of the television series rather than based on facts. DeGuerin has stated he will use the delay in extradition proceedings to fight the basis of Durst's arrest."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Here's a sensible plan to follow: 1. Research about raising chickens: Before getting started, it's essential to gather information about different breeds, their specific requirements, and the challenges involved in raising chickens. This will help you make informed decisions throughout the process. 2. Determine your purpose: Decide why you want to raise chickens. Some people raise chickens for eggs, others for meat, and some just to keep as pets. Your purpose will dictate your choice of breed, coop size, and management practices. 3. Choose the right breed: Select a breed suitable for your purpose and local climate. Consider factors such as egg-laying frequency, temperament, hardiness, and growth rate. 4. Prepare the space: Chickens require a safe, clean, and adequately sized living environment. Design a coop and outdoor run that provide protection from predators, shelter from the elements, and enough space for the chickens to roam and roost (minimum of 10 square feet per bird). 5. Acquire supplies: Purchase or build a feeder and waterer, food storage container, bedding material, nesting boxes, and roosting bars. You'll also need chicken feed formulated for the particular age and purpose of your birds. 6. Purchase and transport chickens: Obtain your chickens from a reputable breeder, hatchery, or local farmer. Transport chicks or adult birds in a secure, well-ventilated container and practice proper biosecurity measures during the process. 7. Get the right feed: Feed your chickens an appropriate diet, consisting of a balanced poultry feed that contains necessary nutrients, vitamins, and minerals. The type of feed depends on the age and purpose of your birds.  8. Maintain cleanliness: Regularly clean the coop, replacing bedding material, and removing droppings. This helps prevent diseases, keeps odor under control, and provides a comfortable environment for your chickens. 9. Ensure health and safety: Monitor your chickens' health and provide necessary vaccinations. Familiarize yourself with common chicken ailments to quickly address any issues. 10. Gain experience and engage with the community: Consult experienced chicken keepers, join online poultry forums, or visit local poultry clubs to continually learn and seek advice.

To get the most pleasure out of your small garden, plant your favorite vegetables. Many vegetables come in dwarf sizes such as tomatoes and eggplants.","output":"These compact varieties allow you to maximize your space while still enjoying the delicious produce you crave. It's important to carefully plan your garden layout, taking into consideration the specific requirements of each vegetable. Utilize vertical space by incorporating trellises, stakes, or cages for crops like peas, beans, and cucumbers to climb, as this not only saves space but also increases air circulation and sun exposure. Another space-saving trick is to use square foot gardening, which is a method of dividing your garden into one-foot square sections, allowing you to determine exactly how many plants can fit in a given area, without overcrowding. Planting in succession can also be extremely beneficial, as it enables you to consistently harvest fresh vegetables throughout the growing season. By timing your planting so that as one crop is harvested, another can be planted in its place, you can quickly replenish your garden and enjoy a continuous supply of your favorite vegetables. Interplanting, or combining crops with complementary growth habits, is another useful technique. For instance, planting fast-growing, shallow-rooted plants like radishes or lettuce alongside slower-growing, deeper-rooted vegetables such as carrots or tomatoes can help you optimize your limited garden space. Take advantage of containers for more flexibility if your garden space is limited or if it lacks proper soil quality. Containers offer the perfect opportunity to grow a wide range of vegetables just about anywhere – on your patio, porch, or balcony. Remember to select containers with proper drainage and ensure the container size is appropriate for the vegetable you're growing. You can even choose self-watering containers to minimize maintenance. Further, using high-quality, well-draining potting soil with the right nutrients will set your vegetables up for success. Good plant care, which includes proper watering, fertilization, and pest control, is essential to your small garden's success. Maintaining a consistent watering schedule and monitoring your plants for any signs of stress or pests can help you address issues early on, ensuring healthy growth. Regularly applying organic fertilizers or compost can provide your vegetables with the necessary nutrients for optimal growth. Additionally, practicing crop rotation – even on a small scale – can help minimize soil-borne diseases, pests, and nutrient depletion. Lastly, don't forget to keep a garden journal to track your progress, plant varieties, successes, and challenges. This valuable tool will help you continuously refine your small garden's layout, growing techniques, and plant selections, ensuring that each season becomes even more fruitful and enjoyable than the last. With careful planning, resourceful use of space, and attentive plant care, you can create a thriving vegetable garden in even the smallest of spaces, bringing you endless joy and satisfaction through the art of homegrown produce."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the final step of the following process: -  A butterfly starts as an egg - The egg hatches - A larva emerges - The larva eats and grows - The larva sheds its skin - The larva enters a chrysalis - The pupa grows inside the chrysalis - The adult butterfly exits the chrysalis - The adult butterfly is now fully grown","output":"The final step in the process of a butterfly's life cycle, after the adult butterfly exits the chrysalis and is fully grown, is the reproduction and laying of eggs to continue the species.  In this final stage, adult butterflies focus on finding a mate and reproducing. Mating in butterflies usually occurs through a courtship process, which can involve visual, tactile, or chemical cues. Some butterflies engage in elaborate courtship flights to attract a mate, while others may release pheromones or use bright colors or patterns on their wings. Once a suitable partner has been identified and the courtship is successful, the butterflies will mate. Following mating, the female butterfly searches for a suitable host plant to lay her eggs. The choice of plant is crucial, as it serves as a food source for the emerging caterpillars. Female butterflies have evolved to be highly selective in choosing host plants, as some plants produce toxins that can harm the caterpillars. In some cases, the female butterfly may even taste potential host plants using sensory organs on her legs, called chemoreceptors, to ensure that the plant is suitable. Once the female butterfly finds the appropriate host plant, she will lay her eggs, typically on the underside of the leaves to provide shelter and camouflage. The number of eggs varies depending on the species, but could range from a few dozen to several hundred. The eggs are secured using a sticky substance produced by the butterfly, which hardens quickly to firmly attach the eggs to the plant. In conclusion, the final step in the process of a butterfly's life cycle is reproductive and involves finding a mate, mating, and laying eggs on a suitable host plant. This ensures the continuation of the species and starts the life cycle all over again with a new generation of butterflies going through the stages of egg, larva, pupa, and adult butterfly."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Step 4: Heat a griddle or frying pan to medium high Justification: This step ensures the cooking surface has reached an optimal temperature for evenly browning the pancakes and allowing them to rise properly. If the griddle is too hot, the pancakes will burn before they're cooked through; if it's too cool, they won't rise or brown properly. Step 5: Pour batter onto the griddle Justification: This step distributes the batter onto the cooking surface in portions to form individual pancakes that will cook evenly.  Perturbation Hypothesis: If there is more sugar available, there will be more mixture. The additional sugar would increase the volume of the mixture. This may result in sweeter and softer pancakes but could also negatively affect their structure, browning, and rise if the sugar content is increased too much. Effect of the Perturbation: Increased sugar content will have both direct and indirect effects on the process. Directly, it will affect the sweetness and texture of the batter and pancakes. Indirectly, it could impact the structure, browning, and rise of the pancakes during cooking, potentially leading to undesired results or alterations in the final appearance and texture. In either case, it will change the final outcome of the pancakes and may require adjustments to the cooking process to accommodate the additional sugar."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Even after the emergence of the professional National Football League (NFL), college football remained extremely popular throughout the U.S.  Although the college game has a much larger margin for talent than its pro counterpart, the sheer number of fans following major colleges provides a financial equalizer for the game, with Division I programs  the highest level  playing in huge stadiums, six of which have seating capacity exceeding 100,000. In many cases, college stadiums employ bench-style seating, as opposed to individual seats with backs and arm rests. This allows them to seat more fans in a given amount of space than the typical professional stadium, which tends to have more features and comforts for fans. (Only two stadiums owned by U.S. colleges or universities  Papa John's Cardinal Stadium at the University of Louisville and FAU Stadium at Florida Atlantic University  consist entirely of chairback seating.)  - Basketball is a sport that is played by two teams of five players on a rectangular court. The objective is to shoot a ball through a hoop in diameter and mounted at a height of to backboards at each end of the court. The game was invented in 1891 by Dr. James Naismith, who would be the first basketball coach of the Kansas Jayhawks, one of the most successful programs in the game's history.   - Women's basketball is one of the few women's sports that developed in tandem with its men's counterpart. It became popular, spreading from the east coast of the United States to the west coast, in large part via women's colleges. From 1895 until 1970, the term \\"women's basketball\\" was also used to refer to netball, which evolved in parallel with modern women's basketball.  - The Big Ten Conference (B1G), formerly Western Conference and Big Nine Conference, is the oldest Division I collegiate athletic conference in the United States. The conference, consisting of 14 members as of 2016, competes in the NCAA Division I; its football teams compete in the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS), formerly known as Division I-A, the highest level of NCAA competition in that sport. The conference includes the flagship public university in each of 11 states stretching from New Jersey to Nebraska, as well as two additional public land grant schools and a private university.  - Baseball is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of nine players each, who take turns batting and fielding.  - The 1948 Michigan Wolverines football team represented the University of Michigan during the 1948 college football season .

The 1948 season was Michigan 's second straight undefeated , untied season . After Fritz Crisler led the 1947 team to a perfect 10 -- 0 record , the Wolverines entered the 1948 season with a 14 - game winning streak dating back to October 1946 . Despite the loss of all four backfield starters from the 1947 team ( including Big Nine MVP Bump Elliott and Heisman Trophy runner - up Bob Chappuis ) , the 1948 team extended the winning streak to 23 games . On offense , Michigan was led by a new backfield that included All - American quarterback Pete Elliott and halfbacks Chuck Ortmann and Leo Koceski . The team scored 252 points , an average of 28 points per game . With Ortmann as the principal passer , the Wolverines relied on an air attack , gaining more yards in the air ( 1,355 ) than on the ground ( 1,262 ) .

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the name of the city that was bombed in the Bristol Blitz? ?  Bristol, the largest city in South West England, has an eclectic combination of architectural styles, ranging from the medieval to 20th century brutalism and beyond. During the mid-19th century, Bristol Byzantine, an architectural style unique to the city, was developed, and several examples have survived. Buildings from most of the architectural periods of the United Kingdom can be seen throughout Bristol. Parts of the fortified city and castle date back to the medieval era, as do some churches dating from the 12th century onwards. Outside the historical city centre there are several large Tudor mansions built for wealthy merchants. Almshouses and public houses of the same period survive, intermingled with areas of more recent development. Several Georgian-era squares were laid out for the enjoyment of the middle class. As the city grew, it merged with its surrounding villages, each with its own character and centre, often clustered around a parish church. The construction of the city's Floating Harbour, taking in the wharves on the River Avon and Frome, provided a focus for industrial development and the growth of the local transport infrastructure. Key elements of which include the Isambard Kingdom Brunel designed Clifton Suspension Bridge and Temple Meads terminus; the latter served from 2002 to 2009 as the British Empire and Commonwealth Museum, but is now closed.The 20th century saw further expansion of the city, the growth of the University of Bristol and the arrival of the aircraft industry. During World War II, the city centre was extensively bombed in the Bristol Blitz. The redevelopment of shopping centres, office buildings, and the harbourside continues to this day. Answer:","output":"The name of the city that was bombed in the Bristol Blitz is Bristol."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

What should catfish smell like?","output":"No, the following two questions are not the same, but they seek similar information regarding the olfactory characteristics of two different types of fish: wild salmon and catfish. Both questions essentially ask how each type of fish should smell in order to assess its freshness and quality. I will provide a detailed analysis and comparison of the smells associated with fresh wild salmon and catfish below. 1. What should wild salmon smell like? Wild salmon, when fresh, should have a mild, pleasant scent indicative of the ocean or fresh water, depending on where it came from. Some people describe the smell of fresh salmon as slightly briny, like seawater, or reminiscent of a fresh, clean, and chilly river. It should not have an overpowering or \\"fishy\\" smell, which can be an indication of spoilage or poor quality. The flesh of the salmon should also appear firm and somewhat moist to the touch. Another indicator of freshness is the presence of a slimy layer on the skin; however, this slime should be clear and not cloudy or discolored. 2. What should catfish smell like? Fresh catfish, like wild salmon, should also have a mild and subtle aroma. A properly cleaned and prepared catfish should smell a bit earthy, but not muddy or musty, as catfish are bottom-dwelling fish that often reside and feed in muddy environments. Their muscles can retain some of these flavors and smells, but careful handling and cleaning can reduce these unwanted characteristics. Fresh catfish should not have a strong or \\"fishy\\" odor, and, again, such a smell can be a sign of spoilage or poor quality. The flesh should appear firm, moist, and white, sometimes with a pinkish or iridescent hue. In summary, while the two questions are not identical, they both pertain to the freshness and quality of two different types of fish: wild salmon and catfish. Both fish should have a subtle, mild aroma that is reflective of their natural environments. Strong or \\"fishy\\" smells should raise suspicions about the freshness and quality of the product."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Review: The fully rounded character of the principal role of this movie, that of the cop torn up by his past and on a path of self-destruction so clear to the viewer, is unique for its time, 1950.  Along with the haunting music and the well written plot, the film is a prime example of film noir at its best. Close-ups of Dana's eyes reveal the anguish within, Karl Malden excels as his boss, who brooks no nonsense but also has compassion for those under his command in the precinct.  Otto Preminger made this type of movie just about his own. If there is any fault it would be with the breath taking beauty of Gene Tierney who seems oddly out of place with the hardened cop.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Fans congratulate Danniella Westbrook on ‘pregnancy’ after sharing THIS snap - but is she expecting? The actress joked about having a baby bump as she lounged in the pool DANNIELLA Westbrook admitted she was “looking very pregnant” in her recent holiday snap – after making no secret about wanting a baby with toyboy lover George Arnold. In a snap which showed the bikini-clad ex EastEnders star lounging out on an inflatable flamingo, she wrote: “So chilled out. Looking very pregnant,” followed by cheeky monkey and love heart Emoji icons. The actress showed off her tanned tummy in the sun-soaked snap as she relaxed in matching swimwear. Yet her pool antics in Portugal came second to her comment as fans flocked to respond to her cheeky suggestion she could be expecting. One was quick to celebrate and wrote: “Congratulations beautiful!!” while one simply put: “Congrats xx.” Another added: “You don’t look pregnant but if you are congrats hun, deserve it all.” Many others quizzed as to whether her words were just meant as tongue-in-cheek and uploaded the question: “Are you pregnant?” One took her comments as pure banter and added: “I think she’s probably just tormenting everyone little moo.” She later uploaded another shot showing her sliding into the water and sporting a headscarf to protect her blonde locks from the water. Yet the star of the small screen, who looked blissfully happy as she topped up her tan on the inflatable, could just as well have been channelling the mood of fellow actress Jennifer Aniston. The Friends star this week spoke out to set the record straight about “absurd” pregnancy rumours. She has insisted she is not expecting a child with husband Justin Theroux and urged fans to stop speculating about her baby status every time she has a “burger for lunch”. They came just hours before Danniella, already a mum-of-two, posted a super-cute snap of her date night with George. The Celebrity Big Brother star showed off her toned legs in a thigh-skimming denim dress which she paired with strappy black sandals and a hat. Danniella, 42, stood sandwiched next to George, 24, as they posed with a huge yacht in the background. She captioned the sweet snap: “Dinner with the one I love,” and hashtags including #mylove #mygeorge. Earlier this year, she revealed she was trying for a baby with George and would even fork out for costly IVF treatment if she struggled to conceive naturally. She told Closer magazine: “I’d love to be a mum again. I feel like this could be my happy ending. “George and I have just bought a house together and I’m excited to get married to him this year. “We’re also going to start trying for a baby, and if it doesn’t work within two months, I’ll have IVF.” She added: “The past two years have been awful but I’ve softened now and let my guard down because I’ve met George. Since I met him I’ve had a smile on my face every day and we would love to get married, so once my divorce has gone through, we’ll do that.” Meanwhile a spokesperson for Danniella denied she was pregnant. They told The Sun Online: \\"She's 100% not pregnant.

Article: Story highlights A pregnant woman was injured during an airstrike in Aleppo, Syria      The baby in her womb was delivered by laparotomy and was found to have a shrapnel wound      Surgeons removed the shrapnel, and the infant survived      (CNN) In war-torn Syria, a baby girl was a victim of the country's civil war before she was even born.      The newborn is named Amel, or \\"Hope,\\" because of what she has survived in her first days of life in Aleppo. She came into this world bearing a scar of war on her forehead.      Her story is a tragic illustration of a human toll of a war that has claimed tens of thousands of lives and pushed millions of others to flee. As European leaders deal with an influx of migrants and refugees flowing through their borders, Amel's story provides the explanation for why the mass migration is happening.      An airstrike, allegedly by government forces, on September 18 damaged several homes in a residential area of Aleppo, including the home where a woman named Amira and her children live, witnesses and doctors told CNN.      Amira, who was nine months pregnant, and three of her children were injured in the attack and taken to a nearby hospital, the witnesses said.

Sri Lanka's cricket team returned home to Colombo early Wednesday, as police in Pakistan searched for at least 12 gunmen believed responsible for the attack that left seven people dead. Sri Lankan player Thilan Samaraweera is taken aboard an ambulance Wednesday in Colombo. Police in Lahore on Wednesday confirmed six police officers and a driver of a van carrying umpires were killed after earlier reports had put the death toll at eight. Six team members were wounded by glass and shrapnel, and two -- Tharanga Paranavitana and Thilan Samaraweera -- were shot in the chest and leg, respectively. Both men were being treated in Colombo and in stable condition, officials said. \\"We are very lucky that no one [sustained] any serious injuries and everyone is in good shape,\\" one player told reporters upon arriving in the capital. \\"There are a few more guys who need more time to recover. And we can hopefully put this behind us and move forward.\\" The attack happened Tuesday at about 9 a.m. (11 p.m. ET Monday), as the visiting Sri Lankan team's bus approached Lahore's Gaddafi Stadium for a match against Pakistan.

Watch Sri Lankan's foreign minister condemnation of the attack ». Teams have long stayed away from Pakistan, concerned about the security situation in a country that is battling an escalating pro-Taliban insurgency. But Sri Lanka -- a country enduring its own civil war with separatist rebels -- agreed in December to visit for a series of matches, after the Indian cricket team called off its tour following the deadly terror attacks in Mumbai in November. Indian authorities blamed those attacks on Pakistan-based militants. The Pakistan Cricket Board had said it was set to lose more than 16 million as a result of India's cancellation, but the Sri Lanka visit was to help it recoup most of the costs, officials said. The Sri Lankan offer to tour was a reciprocal gesture. Pakistan was one of two countries that agreed to tour Sri Lanka during the 1996 World Cup tournament, while other countries refused to travel there because of security concerns. With this attack, fans now worry that Pakistan won't be able to co-host the 2011 Cricket World Cup with India, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. Morgan said the ICC's board will be meeting in April to consider whether the Cup will include stops in Pakistan. \\"The board will have to think very carefully about the extent to which Pakistan will be used for that event,\\" Morgan said. \\"It's a very important event, but the safety and security of players, officials and supporters is very important and the board will be taking that into account.\\"  Read profiles of the wounded players ». \\"This has really damaged Pakistan,\\" former Pakistani cricket player Zahir Abbas told Geo-TV. \\"Already some teams didn't want to come to Pakistan.

He is tasked with the mission to assassinate the rebel leader. In order to infiltrate the rebel movement and get within striking distance of his target, he stirs up trouble in the local bar and gets arrested for disorderly conduct. He is put in the same cell as a captured resistance commander and gains his trust in facilitating the escape. Upon finally reaching the rebel encampment he is met with distrust by the rebels. During the night he attempts to assassinate his target but does not succeed when the distrustful rebels anticipate his actions. Disgraced and tortured by his commanding officers for failing his mission, he breaks out of the interrogation chamber and escapes to the desert, later to be found by native bushmen. He soon learns about them and their culture, and after receiving a ceremonial burn scar in the form of a scorpion (hence the title), he rejoins the freedom fighters and leads an attack against the Soviet camp after a previous attack on the peaceful bushmen. Nikolai obtains an AO-63 from the armory, confronts his corrupt officers and hunts down General Vortek, who attempts to escape in a Mil-24 Hind only to be shot down after takeoff. Nikolai defeats and kills Vortek, as the freedom fighters finally defeat the Soviet oppression.

He is trying to decide if he should store the cupcakes at 0° F or at 10° F in the freezer.  Which temperature will result in slower growth of micro-organisms on the cupcakes?","output":"Storing the cupcakes at the lower temperature of 0° F will result in slower growth of micro-organisms compared to storing them at 10° F. The growth rate of micro-organisms, including bacteria and molds, decreases as the temperature gets colder. Consequently, the cupcakes will be better preserved at a lower temperature, such as 0° F. In the freezing environment, the water content within the food will turn into ice, making it unavailable for microbial growth. It's essential to mention that freezing doesn't completely kill all micro-organisms, but it significantly decreases their metabolic activities and growth rate, which helps in preserving the food quality. It's also important to store the cupcakes in airtight packaging or containers before placing them in the freezer to prevent freezer burn, maintain their moisture content, and reduce the risk of any cross-contamination from other items in the freezer."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Cambodian Deaths Tied to Common Child Illness (PHNOM PENH, Cambodia) — A deadly form of a common childhood illness has been linked to the mysterious deaths in Cambodia that caused alarm when a cause could not immediately be determined, health officials said Monday. Lab tests have confirmed that a virulent strain of hand, foot and mouth disease known as EV-71 is to blame for some of the 59 cases reviewed, including 52 deaths, according to a joint statement from the World Health Organization and Cambodian Health Ministry. The numbers were lowered from the initial report of 62 cases. EV-71 is a virus that can result in paralysis, brain swelling and death. Most of the Cambodian cases involved children younger than 3 who experienced fever, respiratory problems that quickly progressed and sometimes neurological symptoms. Epidemiologists are still trying to piece together information about the cases by interviewing parents because some details were omitted or missing from medical charts and specimens were not taken from most children before they died, said Dr. Nima Asgari, who is leading the investigation at WHO. Of 24 samples tested, 15 came back positive for EV-71. (PHOTOS: Displaced: The Cambodian Diaspora) “As far as I’m aware, EV-71 was not identified as a virus in Cambodia before,” Asgari said, adding that based on the information now available it’s likely that the majority of patients were infected with it. “We are a bit more confident. We are hoping that we can come up with something a bit more conclusive in the next day or so,” he said. Hand, foot and mouth disease has been raging across Asia and usually causes a telltale rash. Rashes were only reported in some of the Cambodian cases, and it’s possible that steroids administered by doctors could have masked that symptom or that it wasn’t recorded, he said. The lab results also identified other diseases in some cases, including mosquito-borne dengue fever and Streptococcus suis, a germ commonly seen in pigs that sometimes infects people, often causing meningitis and hearing loss. Hand, foot and mouth disease is spread by sneezing, coughing and contact with fluid from blisters or infected feces. It is caused by a group of enteroviruses in the same family as polio. No vaccine or specific treatment exists, but illness is typically mild and most children recover quickly without problems. The virus gets its name from the symptoms it causes, including rash, mouth sores and blisters covering the hands and feet. Many infected children don’t get sick but can spread it to others. Neighboring Vietnam has been battling a surging number of hand, foot and mouth disease cases for the past few years, with EV-71 also wreaking havoc there. Last year, the disease sickened more than 110,000 people in Vietnam and killed 166, mostly children whose immune systems were not strong enough to fend off the infection. China is also experiencing an outbreak, and more than 240 people have died of the disease there this year, according to China’s health ministry. The Cambodia investigation is continuing, but the H5N1 bird flu virus, SARS and Nipah — a deadly virus usually spread by fruit bats or pigs _ have all been ruled out.

He was the second son of the first Han emperor, Han Gaozu and Empress Dowager Lü. He is generally remembered as a weak character dominated by his mother, Empress Dowager Lü, personally kind and generous but unable to escape the impact of her viciousness. He tried to protect Ruyi, Prince Yin of Zhao, his younger half-brother, from being murdered by Empress Dowager Lü, but failed. After that he indulged himself in drinking and women and died at a relatively young age. Empress Dowager Lü installed two of his sons, Liu Gong and Liu Hong (known collectively as Emperors Shao of Han), the sons of the Emperor's concubine(s) after he died without a designated heir. Emperor Hui's wife was Empress Zhang Yan, a niece of his by his sister Princess Yuan of Lu; their marriage was the result of insistence by Empress Dowager Lü and was a childless one.  - Lü Zhi (241180 BC), courtesy name Exu, commonly known as Empress Lü and Empress Dowager Lü, or formally Empress Gao of Han, was the empress consort of Emperor Gaozu, the founder and first ruler of the Han Dynasty. They had two known children, Liu Ying (later Emperor Hui of Han) and Princess Yuan of Lu. Lü Zhi was the first woman to assume the title Empress of China. After Emperor Gaozu's death, she was honoured as Empress Dowager and later as Grand Empress Dowager () during the short reigns of Emperor Hui and his successors Liu Gong (Emperor Qianshao) and Liu Hong (Emperor Houshao).  - Liu Ruyi ( simplified Chinese :  ; traditional Chinese :  ; pinyin : Li Rúyì , 208 BC -- 194 BC ) , also known as Prince Yin of Zhao (  , created 198 BC ) was the third son of Emperor Gao of Han and only son of Concubine Qi . In 200 BC , he was made Prince of Dai after Liu Xi was demoted for fleeing his Dai province from Xiongnu forces . In 198 BC , Ruyi replaced Zhang Ao as Prince of Zhao after Ao was falsely accused of conspiring rebellion . After Emperor Gao of Han fallen ill early in 195 BC , he discovered Empress Lü Zhi 's plot to kill Ruyi , and appointed Zhou Chang as prime minister for Zhao province to protect him from Lü . Emperor Gao died later the year and Emperor Hui of Han continued Prince of Zhao 's protection by halting multiple attempts from Empress Dowager Lü on Ruyi 's life . When Emperor Hui left for a winter hunting trip in 194 BC , Empress Dowager Lü had Ruyi killed .  - Zhang Yan (died 163 BC), known formally as Empress Xiaohui () was an empress during the Han Dynasty. She was the daughter of Princess Yuan of Lu (the only daughter of Emperor Gao (Liu Bang) and his wife Empress Lü) and her husband Zhang Ao (, son of Zhang Er), the Prince of Zhao and later Marquess of Xuanping.    What entity does 'liu ruyi' has the relation 'sister' with? The answer to this question is:","output":"Liu Ruyi has a \\"sister\\" relationship with Liu Ying, also known as Emperor Hui of Han.

Answer based on context: China, during the Qing Dynasty, ceded the island of Taiwan, including Penghu, to Japan \\"in perpetuity\\" at the end of the First Sino-Japanese War by signing the Treaty of Shimonoseki. In the Cairo Conference of 1943, the allied powers agreed to have Japan restore \\"all the territories Japan has stolen from the Chinese\\", specifically listing \\"Formosa\\" and Penghu, to the Republic of China after the defeat of Japan. According to both the People's Republic of China and the Republic of China, this agreement was given legal force by the Instrument of Surrender of Japan in 1945. The PRC's UN Ambassador, Wang Yingfan , has stated multiple times in the UN general committee: \\"Taiwan is an inseparable part of China's territory since antiquity\\" and \\"both the 1943 Cairo Declaration and the 1945 Potsdam Declaration have reaffirmed in unequivocal terms China's sovereignty over Taiwan as a matter of international law.\\" The PRC rejects arguments involving the lack of a specific treaty  transferring Taiwan's sovereignty to China by noting that neither PRC nor ROC was a signatory to any such treaty, making the treaties irrelevant with regard to Chinese claims. The ROC argues that the Treaty of Taipei implicitly transferred sovereignty of Taiwan to it, however the US State Dept. disagreed with such an interpretation in its 1971 Starr Memorandum What event happened first, Cairo Declaration or Potsdam Declaration?","output":"The Cairo Declaration happened first. It took place in 1943 during the Cairo Conference, where the allied powers, including the United States, the United Kingdom, and the Republic of China, convened to discuss their strategy against Japan during World War II. The Potsdam Declaration followed two years later, in 1945, when the Allied leaders gathered once again, this time including the Soviet Union, to demand Japan's unconditional surrender and outline the terms of its post-war status. Both declarations addressed the restoration of territories that Japan had taken from China, including Taiwan (Formosa) and Penghu."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

They are investigating the disappearance of patient Rachel Solando, who was incarcerated for drowning her three children. Their only clue is a cryptic note found hidden in Solando's room: \\"The law of 4; who is 67?\\" They arrive just before a storm hits, preventing their return to the mainland for a few days. Daniels and Aule find the staff confrontational; Dr. John Cawley, the lead psychiatrist, refuses to turn over records, and they learn that Solando's doctor, Dr. Lester Sheehan, left the island on vacation immediately after Solando disappeared. Though they are given access to the hospital, they are told Ward C is off limits, while the lighthouse has already been searched. Whilst being interviewed, one patient secretly writes the word \\"RUN\\" in Daniels' notepad. Daniels starts to have migraine headaches from the hospital's atmosphere and experiences waking visions of his involvement in the Dachau liberation reprisals. He has disturbing dreams of his wife, Dolores Chanal, who was killed in a fire set by Andrew Laeddis, a local arsonist. In one instance Chanal tells Daniels that Solando is still on the island somewhere. The same applies to Laeddis who everyone claims was never there to begin with. Daniels later explains to Aule that locating Laeddis was an ulterior personal motive for taking the case. During their investigation Daniels and Aule find that Solando has abruptly resurfaced with no explanation as to her former whereabouts or how she escaped. This prompts Daniels to break into the restricted Ward C. There he encounters George Noyce who is a patient in solitary confinement.

Instructions: This task is about creating an unanswerable question based on a given passage. Construct a question that looks relevant to the given context but is unanswerable. Following are a few suggestions about how to create unanswerable questions: (i) create questions which require satisfying a constraint that is not mentioned in the passage (ii) create questions which require information beyond what is provided in the passage in order to answer (iii) replace an existing entity, number, date mentioned in the passage with other entity, number, date and use it in the question (iv) create a question which is answerable from the passage and then replace one or two words by their antonyms or insert/remove negation words to make it unanswerable. Input: Passage: All Latin characters required by Pe̍h-ōe-jī can be represented using Unicode (or the corresponding ISO/IEC 10646: Universal Character Set), using precomposed or combining (diacritics) characters. Prior to June 2004, the vowel akin to but more open than o, written with a dot above right, was not encoded. The usual workaround was to use the (stand-alone; spacing) character Interpunct (U+00B7, ·) or less commonly the combining character dot above (U+0307). As these are far from ideal, since 1997 proposals have been submitted to the ISO/IEC working group in charge of ISO/IEC 10646—namely, ISO/IEC JTC1/SC2/WG2—to encode a new combining character dot above right. This is now officially assigned to U+0358 (see documents N1593, N2507, N2628, N2699, and N2713). Font support is expected to follow. Output:","output":"Part #1: Create questions which require satisfying a constraint that is not mentioned in the passage. Usage: What is the percentage of documents written in Pe̍h-ōe-jī that use the combining character dot above right (U+0358) instead of interpunct (U+00B7)? This question meets the criteria because the passage does not provide any information about the percentage of documents using the different characters, thus making it unanswerable. Part #2: Create questions which require information beyond what is provided in the passage in order to answer. Usage: Who are the key contributors to the development of the Pe̍h-ōe-jī writing system? This question is unanswerable from the given passage because there is no mention of the individuals who contributed to the development of the writing system. Part #3: Replace an existing entity, number, date mentioned in the passage with another entity, number, date, and use it in the question. Usage: Prior to January 2000, was the vowel akin to but more open than o, written with a dot above right, encoded in Unicode? This question meets the criteria because it replaces the original date (June 2004) with a different date (January 2000), making the question unanswerable based on the provided passage. Part #4: Create a question which is answerable from the passage and then replace one or two words by their antonyms or insert/remove negation words to make it unanswerable. Usage: Did the ISO/IEC working group reject the proposals to encode a new combining character dot above right since 1997? This question meets the criteria because it inserts a negation word (\\"reject\\") in place of the correct action (accepting the proposals), making the question unanswerable from the passage."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

In most of the languages , people usually begin their conversations by a kind of small talk -a casual form of conversation that \\"breaks the ice\\" or fills an awkward silence between people . That is to say , small talk means the little things we talk about to start a conversation . In English-speaking countries such as Britain, people often make small talk about the weather. \\" Nice day, isn't it?\\" \\"Terrible weather , isn't it?\\" However, we still have something special about small talk. It must be about something which both people have the same opinion about. The purpose of small talk is to let both people agree on something. This makes meeting people easier and more comfortable . People usually agree about the weather, so it is a safe topic for small talk. But people often disagree about religion or politics so these are not suitable topics for small talk. The topics for small talk also depend on where the conversation is taking place.

Plot title: Vantage Point Movie plot: U.S. President Henry Ashton (Hurt) attends a political summit in Salamanca, Spain, to promote an international treaty. Displayed with eight differing viewpoints, an assassination attempt on the president occurs, relayed in a time span of 23 minutes. Each time the events unfold from the beginning, a new vantage point is shown revealing additional details, which ultimately completes the story of what actually took place during the incident.[2] From the first vantage point, GNN producer Rex Brooks (Weaver), directs various media personnel from a mobile television studio as the president arrives at the gathering. Mayor De Soto (Rodriguez) delivers a short speech and then introduces the president, who is shot twice as he greets the crowd from the podium. An explosion outside the plaza soon follows. Moments later, the podium itself is destroyed by a secondary explosion, killing and injuring numerous people. As the smoke clears, GNN reporter Angie Jones (Saldana) is seen lying dead in the rubble.[2] The second vantage point follows Secret Service agents Thomas Barnes (Quaid) and Kent Taylor (Fox). Barnes notices a curtain fluttering in the window of a nearby building that was allegedly vacated. He also observes American tourist Howard Lewis (Whitaker) filming the audience. After the president is shot, Barnes tackles a man rushing to the podium named Enrique (Noriega). Taylor pursues a lead to a potential assassin. Following the second explosion, Barnes barges into the GNN production studio and asks to view their footage. He calls Taylor, who reports the direction of the suspected assassin's escape route. Barnes then views an image on one of the camera's live feeds that startles him and prompts him to run out.[2] In the third vantage point, Enrique, a Spanish police officer assigned to protecting the mayor of Salamanca, sees his girlfriend Veronica (Zurer), being embraced by a stranger and overhears them speaking about meeting under an overpass.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Information:  - Colorectal cancer (CRC), also known as bowel cancer, is the development of cancer from the colon or rectum (parts of the large intestine). A cancer is the abnormal growth of cells that have the ability to invade or spread to other parts of the body. Signs and symptoms may include blood in the stool, a change in bowel movements, weight loss, and feeling tired all the time. Most colorectal cancers are due to old age and lifestyle factors with only a small number of cases due to underlying genetic disorders. Some risk factors include diet, obesity, smoking, and lack of physical activity. Dietary factors that increase the risk include red and processed meat as well as alcohol. Another risk factor is inflammatory bowel disease, which includes Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis. Some of the inherited genetic disorders that can cause colorectal cancer include familial adenomatous polyposis and hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer; however, these represent less than 5% of cases. It typically starts as a benign tumor, often in the form of a polyp, which over time becomes cancerous. Bowel cancer may be diagnosed by obtaining a sample of the colon during a sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy. This is then followed by medical imaging to determine if the disease has spread. Screening is effective for preventing and decreasing deaths from colorectal cancer. Screening is recommended starting from the age of 50 to 75. During colonoscopy, small polyps may be removed if found. If a large polyp or tumor is found, a biopsy may be performed to check if it is cancerous. Aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs decrease the risk. Their general use is not recommended for this purpose, however, due to side effects. Treatments used for colorectal cancer may include some combination of surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy and targeted therapy. Cancers that are confined within the wall of the colon may be curable with surgery while cancer that has spread widely are usually not curable, with management being directed...  - Breast cancer is cancer that develops from breast tissue. Signs of breast cancer may include a lump in the breast, a change in breast shape, dimpling of the skin, fluid coming from the nipple, or a red scaly patch of skin. In those with distant spread of the disease, there may be bone pain, swollen lymph nodes, shortness of breath, or yellow skin. Risk factors for developing breast cancer include being female, obesity, lack of physical exercise, drinking alcohol, hormone replacement therapy during menopause, ionizing radiation, early age at first menstruation, having children late or not at all, older age, and family history. About 510% of cases are due to genes inherited from a person's parents, including BRCA1 and BRCA2 among others. Breast cancer most commonly develops in cells from the lining of milk ducts and the lobules that supply the ducts with milk. Cancers developing from the ducts are known as ductal carcinomas, while those developing from lobules are known as lobular carcinomas. In addition, there are more than 18 other sub-types of breast cancer. Some cancers, such as ductal carcinoma in situ, develop from pre-invasive lesions. The diagnosis of breast cancer is confirmed by taking a biopsy of the concerning lump. Once the diagnosis is made, further tests are done to determine if the cancer has spread beyond the breast and which treatments it may respond to. The balance of benefits versus harms of breast cancer screening is controversial. A 2013 Cochrane review stated that it is unclear if mammographic screening does more good or harm. A 2009 review for the US Preventive Services Task Force found evidence of benefit in those 40 to 70 years of age, and the organization recommends screening every two years in women 50 to 74 years old. The medications tamoxifen or raloxifene may be used in an effort to prevent breast cancer in those who are at high risk of developing it. Surgical removal of both breasts is another preventative measure in some high risk women. In those who have been diagnosed with...  - Obesity is a medical condition in which excess body fat has accumulated to the extent that it may have a negative effect on health. People are generally considered obese when their body mass index (BMI), a measurement obtained by dividing a person's weight by the square of the person's height, is over , with the range defined as overweight. Some East Asian countries use lower values. Obesity increases the likelihood of various diseases, particularly heart disease, type 2 diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea, certain types of cancer, and osteoarthritis. Obesity is most commonly caused by a combination of excessive food intake, lack of physical activity, and genetic susceptibility. A few cases are caused primarily by genes, endocrine disorders, medications, or mental illness. The view that obese people eat little yet gain weight due to a slow metabolism is not generally supported. On average, obese people have a greater energy expenditure than their thin counterparts due to the energy required to maintain an increased body mass. Obesity is mostly preventable through a combination of social changes and personal choices. Changes to diet and exercising are the main treatments. Diet quality can be improved by reducing the consumption of energy-dense foods, such as those high in fat and sugars, and by increasing the intake of dietary fiber. Medications may be taken, along with a suitable diet, to reduce appetite or decrease fat absorption. If diet, exercise, and medication are not effective, a gastric balloon or surgery may be performed to reduce stomach volume or bowel length, leading to feeling full earlier or a reduced ability to absorb nutrients from food. Obesity is a leading preventable cause of death worldwide, with increasing rates in adults and children. In 2014, 600 million adults (13%) and 42 million children under the age of five were obese. Obesity is more common in women than men. Authorities view it as one of the most serious public health problems of the 21st century. Obesity is stigmatized in much of...  - The Mesothelioma Applied Research Foundation ( Meso Foundation , formerly MARF ) is a non-profit organization that funds mesothelioma research , provides services to patients , educates the public , and advocates in Washington , DC for governmental funding for mesothelioma research . The organization 's mission is to eradicate mesothelioma , a cancer caused by exposure to asbestos , as a life - ending disease . Its donors include lawyers , companies that have manufactured asbestos products and victims , along with their family and friends . To date , the foundation has funded over  8.2 million in clinical research and is the host of the annual International Symposium on Malignant Mesothelioma .  - Lung cancer, also known as lung carcinoma, is a malignant lung tumor characterized by uncontrolled cell growth in tissues of the lung. If left untreated, this growth can spread beyond the lung by the process of metastasis into nearby tissue or other parts of the body. Most cancers that start in the lung, known as primary lung cancers, are carcinomas. The two main types are small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) and non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC). The most common symptoms are coughing (including coughing up blood), weight loss, shortness of breath, and chest pains. The vast majority (85%) of cases of lung cancer are due to long-term tobacco smoking. About 1015% of cases occur in people who have never smoked. These cases are often caused by a combination of genetic factors and exposure to radon gas, asbestos, second-hand smoke, or other forms of air pollution. Lung cancer may be seen on chest radiographs and computed tomography (CT) scans. The diagnosis is confirmed by biopsy which is usually performed by bronchoscopy or CT-guidance. Prevention is by avoiding risk factors including smoking and air pollution. Treatment and long-term outcomes depend on the type of cancer, the stage (degree of spread), and the person's overall health. Most cases are not curable. Common treatments include surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. NSCLC is sometimes treated with surgery, whereas SCLC usually responds better to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Worldwide in 2012, lung cancer occurred in 1.8 million people and resulted in 1.6 million deaths. This makes it the most common cause of cancer-related death in men and second most common in women after breast cancer. The most common age at diagnosis is 70 years. Overall, 17.4% of people in the United States diagnosed with lung cancer survive five years after the diagnosis, while outcomes on average are worse in the developing world. Signs and symptoms. Signs and symptoms which may suggest lung cancer include:  - Stomach cancer, also known as gastric cancer, is cancer developing from the lining of the stomach. Early symptoms may include heartburn, upper abdominal pain, nausea and loss of appetite. Later signs and symptoms may include weight loss, yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes, vomiting, difficulty swallowing, and blood in the stool among others. The cancer may spread from the stomach to other parts of the body, particularly the liver, lungs, bones, lining of the abdomen and lymph nodes. The most common cause is infection by the bacterium \\"Helicobacter pylori\\", which accounts for more than 60% of cases. Certain types of \\"H. pylori\\" have greater risks than others. Other common causes include eating pickled vegetables and smoking. About 10% of cases run in families and between 1% and 3% of cases are due to genetic syndromes inherited from a person's parents such as hereditary diffuse gastric cancer. Most cases of stomach cancers are gastric carcinomas. This type can be divided into a number of subtypes. Lymphomas and mesenchymal tumors may also develop in the stomach. Most of the time, stomach cancer develops in stages over years. Diagnosis is usually by biopsy done during endoscopy. This is followed by medical imaging to determine if the disease has spread to other parts of the body. Japan and South Korea, two countries that have high rates of the disease, screen for stomach cancer. A Mediterranean diet lowers the risk of cancer as does the stopping of smoking. There is tentative evidence that treating \\"H. pylori\\" decreases the future risk. If cancer is treated early, many cases can be cured. Treatments may include some combination of surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and targeted therapy. If treated late, palliative care may be advised. Outcomes are often poor with a less than 10% 5-year survival rate globally. This is largely because most people with the condition present with advanced disease. In the United States 5-year survival is 28% while in South Korea it is over 65% partly due to...  - Silic (19952013) is a French Thoroughbred racehorse who competed both in France and in the United States. His most notable win came in the 1999 Breeders' Cup Mile.  - A brain tumor or intracranial neoplasm occurs when abnormal cells form within the brain. There are two main types of tumors: malignant or cancerous tumors and benign tumors. Cancerous tumors can be divided into primary tumors that start within the brain, and secondary tumors that have spread from somewhere else, known as brain metastasis tumors. All types of brain tumors may produce symptoms that vary depending on the part of the brain involved. These symptoms may include headaches, seizures, problem with vision, vomiting, and mental changes. The headache is classically worse in the morning and goes away with vomiting. More specific problems may include difficulty in walking, speaking, and with sensation. As the disease progresses unconsciousness may occur. The cause of most brain tumors is unknown. Uncommon risk factors include inherited neurofibromatosis, exposure to vinyl chloride, EpsteinBarr virus, and ionizing radiation. The evidence for mobile phones is not clear. The most common types of primary tumors in adults are meningiomas (usually benign), and astrocytomas such as glioblastomas. In children, the most common type is a malignant medulloblastoma. Diagnosis is usually by medical examination along with computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. This is then often confirmed by a biopsy. Based on the findings, the tumors are divided into different grades of severity. Treatment may include some combination of surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy. Anticonvulsant medication may be needed if seizures occur. Dexamethasone and furosemide may be used to decrease swelling around the tumor. Some tumors grow gradually, requiring only monitoring and possibly needing no further intervention. Treatments that use a person's immune system are being studied. Outcome varies considerably depending on the type of tumor and how far it has spread at diagnosis. Glioblastomas usually have poor outcomes while meningiomas usually have good outcomes. The average five-year survival rate for brain cancer in the...  - Asbestos is a set of six naturally occurring silicate minerals, which all have in common their eponymous asbestiform habit: long (roughly 1:20 aspect ratio), thin fibrous crystals, with each visible fiber composed of millions of microscopic \\"fibrils\\" that can be released by abrasion and other processes. They are commonly known by their colors, as \\"blue asbestos\\", \\"brown asbestos\\", \\"white asbestos\\", and \\"green asbestos\\".  - Melanoma, also known as malignant melanoma, is a type of cancer that develops from the pigment-containing cells known as melanocytes. Melanomas typically occur in the skin but may rarely occur in the mouth, intestines, or eye. In women they most commonly occur on the legs, while in men they are most common on the back. Sometimes they develop from a mole with concerning changes including an increase in size, irregular edges, change in color, itchiness, or skin breakdown. The primary cause of melanoma is ultraviolet light (UV) exposure in those with low levels of skin pigment. The UV light may be from either the sun or from other sources, such as tanning devices. About 25% develop from moles. Those with many moles, a history of affected family members, and who have poor immune function are at greater risk. A number of rare genetic defects such as xeroderma pigmentosum also increase risk. Diagnosis is by biopsy of any concerning skin lesion. Using sunscreen and avoiding UV light may prevent melanoma. Treatment is typically removal by surgery. In those with slightly larger cancers, nearby lymph nodes may be tested for spread. Most people are cured if spread has not occurred. For those in whom melanoma has spread, immunotherapy, biologic therapy, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy may improve survival. With treatment the five-year survival rates in the United States is 98% among those with localized disease and 17% among those in whom spread has occurred. The likelihood that it will come back or spread depends how thick the melanoma is, how fast the cells are dividing, and whether or not the overlying skin has broken down. Melanoma is the most dangerous type of skin cancer. Globally, in 2012, it occurred in 232,000 people and resulted in 55,000 deaths. Australia and New Zealand have the highest rates of melanoma in the world. There are also high rates in Northern Europe and North America, while it is less common in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Melanoma is more common in men than women. Melanoma has become more...  - The brain is an organ that serves as the center of the nervous system in all vertebrate and most invertebrate animals. The brain is located in the head, usually close to the sensory organs for senses such as vision. The brain is the most complex organ in a vertebrate's body. In a human, the cerebral cortex contains approximately 1533 billion neurons, each connected by synapses to several thousand other neurons. These neurons communicate with one another by means of long protoplasmic fibers called axons, which carry trains of signal pulses called action potentials to distant parts of the brain or body targeting specific recipient cells.  - Hepatitis B is an infectious disease caused by the hepatitis B virus (HBV) which affects the liver. It can cause both acute and chronic infections. Many people have no symptoms during the initial infection. Some develop a rapid onset of sickness with vomiting, yellowish skin, tiredness, dark urine and abdominal pain. Often these symptoms last a few weeks and rarely does the initial infection result in death. It may take 30 to 180 days for symptoms to begin. In those who get infected around the time of birth 90% develop chronic while less than 10% of those infected after the age of five do. Most of those with chronic disease have no symptoms; however, cirrhosis and liver cancer may eventually develop. These complications result in the death of 15 to 25% of those with chronic disease. The virus is transmitted by exposure to infectious blood or body fluids. Infection around the time of birth or from contact with other people's blood during childhood is the most frequent method by which hepatitis B is acquired in areas where the disease is common. In areas where the disease is rare, intravenous drug use and sexual intercourse are the most frequent routes of infection. Other risk factors include working in healthcare, blood transfusions, dialysis, living with an infected person, travel in countries where the infection rate is high, and living in an institution. Tattooing and acupuncture led to a significant number of cases in the 1980s; however, this has become less common with improved sterility. The viruses cannot be spread by holding hands, sharing eating utensils, kissing, hugging, coughing, sneezing, or breastfeeding. The infection can be diagnosed 30 to 60 days after exposure. The diagnosis is usually confirmed by testing the blood for parts of the virus and for antibodies against the virus. It is one of five known hepatitis viruses: A, B, C, D, and E. The infection has been preventable by vaccination since 1982. Vaccination is recommended by the World Health Organization in the first day of life if...  - Mesothelioma is a type of cancer that develops from the thin layer of tissue that covers many of the internal organs (known as the mesothelium). The most common area affected is the lining of the lungs and chest wall. Less commonly the lining of the abdomen and rarely the sac surrounding the heart, or the sac surrounding the testis may be affected. Signs and symptoms of mesothelioma may include shortness of breath due to fluid around the lung, a swollen abdomen, chest wall pain, cough, feeling tired, and weight loss. These symptoms typically come on slowly. Greater than 80% of mesothelioma cases are caused by exposure to asbestos. The greater the exposure the greater the risk. As of 2013 about 125 million people have been exposed to asbestos at work. High rates of disease occur in people who mine asbestos, produce products from asbestos, work with asbestos products, live with asbestos workers, or work in buildings containing asbestos. Often it is around 40 years between exposure and the cancer starting. Washing the clothing of someone who worked with asbestos also increases the risk. Other risk factors include genetics and infection with the simian virus 40. The diagnosis may be suspected based on chest X-ray and CT scan findings, and is confirmed by either examining fluid produced by the cancer or by a tissue biopsy of the cancer. Prevention centers around reducing exposure to asbestos. Treatment often includes surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. A procedure known as pleurodesis, which involves using substances such as talc to scar together the pleura, may be used to prevent more fluid from building up around the lungs. Chemotherapy often includes the medications cisplatin and pemetrexed. The percentage of people that survive five years following diagnosis is on average 8% in the United States. In 2013 about 50,000 people had mesothelioma and 34,000 died from the disease. Rates of mesothelioma vary in different areas of the world. Rates are higher in Australia, the United Kingdom, and lower in...  - Palliative care is a multidisciplinary approach to specialized medical care for people with life-limiting illnesses. It focuses on providing people with relief from the symptoms, pain, physical stress, and mental stress of the terminal diagnosis. The goal of such therapy is to improve quality of life for both the person and their family. Evidence as of 2016 supports improvement in quality of life.  - Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is a group of blood cancers that includes all types of lymphoma except Hodgkin's lymphomas. Symptoms include enlarged lymph nodes, fever, night sweats, weight loss, and feeling tired. Other symptoms may include bone pain, chest pain, or itchiness. Some forms are slow growing while others are fast growing. Lymphomas are types of cancer that develops from lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell. Risk factors include poor immune function, autoimmune diseases, \\"Helicobacter pylori\\" infection, hepatitis C, obesity, and \\"Epstein-Barr virus\\" infection. The World Health Organization (WHO) classifies lymphomas into five major groups, including one for Hodgkin's lymphoma. Within the four groups for NHL there are over 60 specific types of lymphoma. Diagnosis is by examination of a bone marrow or lymph node biopsy. Medical imaging is done to help with cancer staging. Treatment depends on if the lymphoma is slow or fast growing and if it is in one area or many areas. Treatments may include chemotherapy, radiation, immunotherapy, targeted therapy, stem cell transplantation, surgery, or watchful waiting. If the blood becomes overly thick due to antibodies, plasmapheresis may be used. Radiation and some chemotherapy, however, increase the risk of other cancers, heart disease or nerve problems over the subsequent decades. In 2013 about 2.96 million people had non-Hodgkin lymphoma and 226,000 died. In the United States 2.1% of people are affected at some point in their life. The most common age of diagnosis is between 65 to 75 years old. The percentage of people who survive five years in the United States is 71%.  - Cancer is a group of diseases involving abnormal cell growth with the potential to invade or spread to other parts of the body. Not all tumors are cancerous; benign tumors do not spread to other parts of the body. Possible signs and symptoms include a lump, abnormal bleeding, prolonged cough, unexplained weight loss and a change in bowel movements. While these symptoms may indicate cancer, they may have other causes. Over 100 types of cancers affect humans. Tobacco use is the cause of about 22% of cancer deaths. Another 10% is due to obesity, poor diet, lack of physical activity and drinking alcohol. Other factors include certain infections, exposure to ionizing radiation and environmental pollutants. In the developing world nearly 20% of cancers are due to infections such as hepatitis B, hepatitis C and human papillomavirus (HPV). These factors act, at least partly, by changing the genes of a cell. Typically many genetic changes are required before cancer develops. Approximately 510% of cancers are due to inherited genetic defects from a person's parents. Cancer can be detected by certain signs and symptoms or screening tests. It is then typically further investigated by medical imaging and confirmed by biopsy. Many cancers can be prevented by not smoking, maintaining a healthy weight, not drinking too much alcohol, eating plenty of vegetables, fruits and whole grains, vaccination against certain infectious diseases, not eating too much processed and red meat, and avoiding too much sunlight exposure. Early detection through screening is useful for cervical and colorectal cancer. The benefits of screening in breast cancer are controversial. Cancer is often treated with some combination of radiation therapy, surgery, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy. Pain and symptom management are an important part of care. Palliative care is particularly important in people with advanced disease. The chance of survival depends on the type of cancer and extent of disease at the start of treatment. In children under 15 at...  - The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, with internal convective motion that generates a magnetic field via a dynamo process.<ref name=\\"doi10.1146/annurev-astro-081913-040012\\"></ref> It is by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth. Its diameter is about 109 times that of Earth, and its mass is about 330,000 times that of Earth, accounting for about 99.86% of the total mass of the Solar System. About three quarters of the Sun's mass consists of hydrogen (~73%); the rest is mostly helium (~25%), with much smaller quantities of heavier elements, including oxygen, carbon, neon, and iron.  - Skin cancers are cancers that arise from the skin. They are due to the development of abnormal cells that have the ability to invade or spread to other parts of the body. There are three main types of skin cancers: basal-cell skin cancer (BCC), squamous-cell skin cancer (SCC) and melanoma. The first two together along with a number of less common skin cancers are known as nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC). Basal-cell cancer grows slowly and can damage the tissue around it but is unlikely to spread to distant areas or result in death. It often appears as a painless raised area of skin, that may be shiny with small blood vessel running over it or may present as a raised area with an ulcer. Squamous-cell cancer is more likely to spread. It usually presents as a hard lump with a scaly top but may also form an ulcer. Melanomas are the most aggressive. Signs include a mole that has changed in size, shape, color, has irregular edges, has more than one color, is itchy or bleeds. Greater than 90% of cases are caused by exposure to ultraviolet radiation from the Sun. This exposure increases the risk of all three main types of skin cancer. Exposure has increased partly due to a thinner ozone layer. Tanning beds are becoming another common source of ultraviolet radiation. For melanomas and basal-cell cancers exposure during childhood is particularly harmful. For squamous-cell cancers total exposure, irrespective of when it occurs, is more important. Between 20% and 30% of melanomas develop from moles. People with light skin are at higher risk as are those with poor immune function such as from medications or HIV/AIDS. Diagnosis is by biopsy. Decreasing exposure to ultraviolet radiation and the use of sunscreen appear to be effective methods of preventing melanoma and squamous-cell cancer. It is not clear if sunscreen affects the risk of basal-cell cancer. Nonmelanoma skin cancer is usually curable. Treatment is generally by surgical removal but may less commonly involve radiation therapy or topical medications such as...  - Ionizing radiation (ionising radiation) is radiation that carries enough energy to free electrons from atoms or molecules, thereby ionizing them. Ionizing radiation is made up of energetic subatomic particles, ions or atoms moving at high speeds (usually greater than 1% of the speed of light), and electromagnetic waves on the high-energy end of the electromagnetic spectrum.  - Lymphoma is a group of blood cell tumors that develop from lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell). The name often refers to just the cancerous ones rather than all such tumors. Signs and symptoms may include enlarged lymph nodes, fever, drenching sweats, unintended weight loss, itching, and constantly feeling tired. The enlarged lymph nodes are usually painless. The sweats are most common at night. There are dozens of subtypes of lymphomas. The two main categories of lymphomas are Hodgkin's lymphomas (HL) and the non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL). The World Health Organization (WHO) includes two other categories as types of lymphoma: multiple myeloma and immunoproliferative diseases. About 90% of lymphomas are non-Hodgkin lymphomas. Lymphomas and leukemias are a part of the broader group of tumors of the hematopoietic and lymphoid tissues. Risk factors for Hodgkin lymphoma include infection with EpsteinBarr virus and a history of the disease in the family. Risk factors for common types of non-Hodgkin lymphomas include autoimmune diseases, HIV/AIDS, infection with human T-lymphotropic virus, immunosuppressant medications, and some pesticides. Eating large amounts of red meat and tobacco smoking may also increase the risk. Diagnosis, if enlarged lymph nodes are present, is usually by lymph node biopsy. Blood, urine, and bone marrow testing may also be useful in the diagnosis. Medical imaging may then be done to determine if and where the cancer has spread. Lymphoma most often spreads to the lungs, liver, and/or brain. Treatment may involve one or more of the following: chemotherapy, radiation therapy, targeted therapy, and surgery. In some non-Hodgkin lymphomas, an increased amount of protein produced by the lymphoma cells causes the blood to become so thick that plasmapheresis is performed to remove the protein. Watchful waiting may be appropriate for certain types. The outcome depends on the subtype with some being curable and treatment prolonging survival in most. The five-year survival rate in the United States...  - Hepatitis C is an infectious disease caused by the hepatitis C virus (HCV) that primarily affects the liver. During the initial infection people often have mild or no symptoms. Occasionally a fever, dark urine, abdominal pain, and yellow tinged skin occurs. The virus persists in the liver in about 75% to 85% of those initially infected. Early on chronic infection typically has no symptoms. Over many years however, it often leads to liver disease and occasionally cirrhosis. In some cases, those with cirrhosis will develop complications such as liver failure, liver cancer, or esophageal and gastric varices. HCV is spread primarily by blood-to-blood contact associated with intravenous drug use, poorly sterilized medical equipment, needlestick injuries in healthcare, and transfusions. Using blood screening, the risk from a transfusion is less than one per two million. It may also be spread from an infected mother to her baby during birth. It is not spread by superficial contact. It is one of five known hepatitis viruses: A, B, C, D, and E. Diagnosis is by blood testing to look for either antibodies to the virus or its RNA. Testing is recommended in all people who are at risk. There is no vaccine against hepatitis C. Prevention includes harm reduction efforts among people who use intravenous drugs and testing donated blood. Chronic infection can be cured about 90% of the time with treatments that include the medications sofosbuvir or simeprevir. Previous to this a combination of peginterferon and ribavirin was used which had a cure rate around 50% and greater side effects. Getting access to the newer treatments however can be expensive. Those who develop cirrhosis or liver cancer may require a liver transplant. Hepatitis C is the leading reason for liver transplantation, though the virus usually recurs after transplantation. An estimated 130200 million people worldwide are infected with hepatitis C. In 2013 about 11 million new cases occurred. It occurs most commonly in Africa and Central and East Asia. About...  - Cervical cancer is a cancer arising from the cervix. It is due to the abnormal growth of cells that have the ability to invade or spread to other parts of the body. Early on, typically no symptoms are seen. Later symptoms may include abnormal vaginal bleeding, pelvic pain, or pain during sexual intercourse. While bleeding after sex may not be serious, it may also indicate the presence of cervical cancer. Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection appears to be involved in the development of more than 90% of cases; most people who have had HPV infections, however, do not develop cervical cancer. Other risk factors include smoking, a weak immune system, birth control pills, starting sex at a young age, and having many sexual partners, but these are less important. Cervical cancer typically develops from precancerous changes over 10 to 20 years. About 90% of cervical cancer cases are squamous cell carcinomas, 10% are adenocarcinoma, and a small number are other types. Diagnosis is typically by cervical screening followed by a biopsy. Medical imaging is then done to determine whether or not the cancer has spread. HPV vaccines protect against between two and seven high-risk strains of this family of viruses and may prevent up to 90% of cervical cancers. As a risk of cancer still exists, guidelines recommend continuing regular Pap smears. Other methods of prevention include: having few or no sexual partners and the use of condoms. Cervical cancer screening using the Pap smear or acetic acid can identify precancerous changes which when treated can prevent the development of cancer. Treatment of cervical cancer may consist of some combination of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiotherapy. Five year survival rates in the United States are 68%. Outcomes, however, depend very much on how early the cancer is detected. Worldwide, cervical cancer is both the fourth-most common cause of cancer and the fourth-most common cause of death from cancer in women. In 2012, an estimated 528,000 cases of cervical cancer occurred, with 266,000...  - Prostate cancer, also known as carcinoma of the prostate, is the development of cancer in the prostate, a gland in the male reproductive system. Most prostate cancers are slow growing; however, some grow relatively quickly. The cancer cells may spread from the prostate to other parts of the body, particularly the bones and lymph nodes. It may initially cause no symptoms. In later stages it can lead to difficulty urinating, blood in the urine, or pain in the pelvis, back or when urinating. A disease known as benign prostatic hyperplasia may produce similar symptoms. Other late symptoms may include feeling tired due to low levels of red blood cells. Factors that increase the risk of prostate cancer include: older age, a family history of the disease, and race. About 99% of cases occur in those over the age of 50. Having a first-degree relative with the disease increases the risk two to threefold. In the United States it is more common in the African American population than the white American population. Other factors that may be involved include a diet high in processed meat, red meat, or milk products or low in certain vegetables. An association with gonorrhea has been found, but a reason for this relationship has not been identified. Prostate cancer is diagnosed by biopsy. Medical imaging may then be done to determine if the cancer has spread to other parts of the body. Prostate cancer screening is controversial. Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing increases cancer detection but does not decrease mortality. The United States Preventive Services Task Force recommends against screening using the PSA test, due to the risk of overdiagnosis and overtreatment, as most cancer diagnosed would remain asymptomatic. The USPSTF concludes that the potential benefits of testing do not outweigh the expected harms. While 5-reductase inhibitors appear to decrease low-grade cancer risk they do not affect high-grade cancer risk and thus are not recommended for prevention. Supplementation with vitamins or minerals does not...    Given the paragraphs above, decide what entity has the relation 'inception' with '1999'.

It was almost as if David Moyes had borrowed some of the magic of the FA Cup on Sunday night at Anoeta as his Real Sociedad played at being giant-killers and took the scalp of Barcelona. On one of the greatest nights of his managerial career Moyes masterminded a 1-0 win with the side he took over last November seeing off Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar in style. He was given a helping hand by opposing coach Luis Enrique who bizarrely left Messi out of his starting line-up – perhaps the Barca coach was also paying homage to the world’s oldest club cup competition by resting his most important players.

And I marvelled more to see the two of us, both lovers of one lady and eager rivals, burying for the nonce our feuds, and with the same hope serving the same cause.  We slept the night at Aird's store, and early the next morning found Ringan.  A new Ringan indeed, as unlike the buccaneer I knew as he was unlike the Quaker.  He was now the gentleman of Breadalbane, dressed for the part with all the care of an exquisite.  He rode a noble roan, in his Spanish belt were stuck silver-hafted pistols, and a long sword swung at his side.  When I presented Grey to him, he became at once the cavalier, as precise in his speech and polite in his deportment as any Whitehall courtier.  They talked high and disposedly of genteel matters, and you would have thought that that red-haired pirate had lived his life among proud lords and high-heeled ladies.

African football's ruling body, the Confederation of African Football, has called for a thorough investigation into how 15 fans died at a league match in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The fatalities occurred after a stampede broke out in the closing stages of Sunday's decisive meeting between the country's biggest clubs, AS Vita Club and TP Mazembe. Reports state that trouble flared after fans of home side Vita started throwing missiles onto the pitch with their team trailing 1-0 in a game where the victor would take the title. The police responded by firing tear gas whereupon a stampede for the exit gates led to chaotic scenes of overcrowding, resulting in the deaths and injuries to over 20 others. On its website, the Confederation of African Football (CAF) said the stampede 'caused the collapse of a wall and a gate of the Tata Raphael stadium'. The match was taking place in the Congolese capital Kinshasa, at the stadium that staged the legendary 'Rumble in the Jungle' boxing bout between Muhammad Ali and George Foreman in 1974. \\"I wish to reemphasize that any acts of violence have no place in football,\\" CAF President Issa Hayatou told cafonline.com. \\"They must be condemned in the strongest possible terms and I urge FECOFA (the Congolese FA) and authorities in DR Congo to thoroughly investigate this matter and ensure that measures (are) put in place to avoid a repeat of any incidents.\\" The long-serving Cameroonian also demanded that CAF be kept abreast of any proposed security measures. Kinshasa governor Andre Kimbuta has already set up a commission of inquiry to investigate the disaster. \\"On behalf of FIFA and in my own name, I offer you, and the Congolese FA, my sincerest condolences,\\" wrote FIFA President Sepp Blatter in a letter to the President of FECOFA. \\"I would be most grateful if you would pass on the deep sympathy and support of the entire international football community to the families, loved ones and clubs of the deceased and victims at this very difficult time.\\" \\"May this message soften their pain and bring them support and comfort.\\" At FIFA's headquarters in the Swiss city Zurich, the flags of both DR Congo and CAF were flown at half-mast in a sign of mourning. The disaster is the worst at a Congolese football match since a game in Butembo in 2008, when 13 spectators -- many of whom were children -- died after police fired tear gas into the crowd shortly after stones had been thrown by the fans. Six years on, a similar set of circumstances has sparked a further devastating loss of life. The two teams are set to meet again on the weekend of May 24-25 in the group stages of the African Champions League. CAF is considering whether to play the match between AS Vita, crowned African champions in the 1970s, and four-time continental winners Mazembe behind closed doors. Mazembe stunned the footballing world in 2010 when becoming the first African side to reach the final of FIFA's Club World Cup, but their name may now conjure up far sadder emotions.

Unfortunately, because the zooming is rather fast, it is easy to miss the rest of the sentence, so as you correctly note, some viewers got an incorrect impression. It would have been fair for Moore to point out this possible misinterpretation on his website. However, the claim of deliberate distortion is ludicrous for several reasons: a) Moore clearly states that \\"before he came to Flint\\", Heston gave an interview. In the excerpt from said interview, we can see that it is from March. If Moore wanted to deceive his viewers, why would he say this, and show the month the interview was published? b) Why should Moore leave the words \\"Clinton is on the Today Show\\" visible in the text, which is necessary to correctly interpret the highlighted part? I reviewed the sequence several times and it is perfectly possible to see this text without pausing. c) Both the \\"soccer mom\\" interview and the sequences showing the NRA rally make no effort to distort the fact that this rally happened months after the fact. The camera lingers on Bush/Cheney posters, and the protestor is quoted as saying that \\"we wanted to let the NRA know that we haven't forgotten about Kayla Rolland\\". You make the hysterical claim that the interview \\"may be faked\\" (on the basis that no name is shown for the interviewee), but if Moore had faked it, why the hell should he put this sentence in the protestor's mouth, which directly contradicts the conclusion that the rally happened hours after Kayla's death? Why did Moore, the masterful deveiver, not edit this sequence out? This makes no sense. Opinions may vary on how tasteless it was for Heston to hold a pro gun rally on the location of the nation's youngest school shooting months after the fact, but this sequence of \\"Bowling\\" is without doubt the most unfair to Heston. The claims of deliberate distortion don't hold up when viewing the whole scene, though -- as \\"Hanlon's Razor\\" states, one should never attribute to malice what can be attributed to incompetence. The somewhat inept editing of the NRA press release has led some viewers to wrong conclusions, which is unfortunate, but Moore's critics have no interest in viewing the matter fairly. Had they done so, Moore himself would probably have apologized for the gaffe. In any case, at no point does Moore make a false statement, in contradiction to claims by critics that his documentary is \\"full of lies\\".  After reading the above, is \\"Before he came to Flint\\" the correct answer to the question \\"When did Heston give an interview?\\"?","output":"Yes, \\"before he came to Flint\\" is the correct answer to the question \\"When did Heston give an interview?\\" as per the information provided in the text.

Adam Farooqui holds a sign as he stands at Zuccotti Park on Wednesday in New York. \\"We need to have a symbolic presence,\\" said Ned Merrill, 52, a blanket draped over his shoulder. He spoke as workers for Brookfield Office Properties, which owns the plaza, maneuvered around the scattered protesters with steam cleaners. The barricades that came down Tuesday were chained together and neatly stacked at the north end of the park. On Tuesday, about 300 protesters filled Zuccotti after the barricades were taken down. Police spokesman Paul Browne said the New York Police Department and Brookfield had been talking about removing the barriers last week. The decision was made to remove them Tuesday because officials felt they were no longer necessary, Browne said. Merrill said it's important for at least a few protesters to be at Zuccotti at all times. He said he's been there from midnight to about 10 a.m. most nights since Dec. 1. \\"Most people in American know that something is wrong,\\" he said. \\"Much of what is wrong is that money owns the political process.\\" Robert Segal, who is 47 and works in a wine store, also spent Tuesday night at Zuccotti. \\"The rest of the world want a place where they can come down and join Occupy Wall Street at critical moments,\\" he said. Tents and sleeping bags have been banned from Zuccotti Park since a Nov. 15 police raid evicted protesters who had been sleeping there since Sept. 17. Merrill said security guards have prevented him from sitting on a piece of plastic foam when he spends the night there. They told him it was considered bedding, he said. On Monday, civil rights groups filed a complaint with the city's buildings department saying the barricades were a violation of city zoning law.

Please answer the following question: If some flowers use stems to store water, then what do some flowers use to store most of their water?  Answer choices: - fibrous  - lipids  - roots  - sodium  - keratin  - solutes  - fibers  - stems A:","output":"Some flowers use their roots to store most of their water. In many plant species, roots play a crucial role in not only the absorption of water from the surrounding soil but also in the storage of water (and nutrients) to help the plant survive during spells of drought or unfavorable conditions. Different species of plants have evolved diverse root systems to cater to their specific needs, and some plants are adapted to store more significant portions of water in their roots. While stems are the primary water storage structure in some plants (such as cacti), roots serve as the primary water storage system in many other species of flowers and plants. The roots of these plants have evolved to have specialized structures that allow them to efficiently take in and store water from the surrounding environment. Some plants have tuberous roots, which are modified, swollen underground roots, for this purpose. A well-known example of a plant with a tuberous root adapted for water storage is the dahlia. In addition, many desert plants, such as the mesquite tree, have developed deep roots to access water stored far beneath the ground surface. In contrast, other answer choices do not refer to structures that are primarily involved in water storage: - Fibrous roots refer to a root system that consists of many branches and does not include a primary taproot. While fibrous roots do absorb water, they are not specialized structures for water storage. - Lipids, sodium, keratin, and solutes are not structures within a plant but rather molecules or compounds. Lipids are fats and waxes mainly responsible for energy storage, while sodium and solutes are elements often found dissolved in a plant's internal fluids. Keratin is a protein found in hair, nails, and the outer layer of human skin, and not found in plants. - Fibers are a type of tissue found in the cell walls of plants, often in the form of lignin and cellulose, which help provide structural support. Fibers also do not function primarily in water storage. - Stems are already mentioned in the question; some flowers use stems for water storage, but the question asks for another structure involved in water storage for other flowers. In conclusion, among the given answer choices, roots are the primary structure that some flowers utilize to store most of their water, providing essential support and resources for their growth and survival during periods of water scarcity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. If you're just starting out with the instrument, there's no need to spend an excessive amount of money on a violin, but like most instruments, the quality of the violin generally rises as the price goes up. Expect to spend a few hundred dollars on a decent beginner's violin.  Buy full size or 4/4, if you're an adult. The violin is a small instrument, but there are specially designed smaller sizes available. These are generally only intended for younger children, so be sure the violin you're buying is full size unless you're very small. You can ask the shop for a recommendation if you aren't sure.  You can also ask the shop to measure your arm length to see what size violin you need. When holding the violin in the playing position, straighten your left arm and the tops of your fingertips should be near the top the violin scroll. If your arm is way past the top, the violin is too small. Buy from a reputable seller. Music stores stake their reputations on selling solid instruments that are free of obvious flaws and damage. As a beginner, you won't be able to coax a very pleasant sound from your instrument for some time, so flaws in privately sold violins might not be apparent to you until it is far too late to complain. Only buy from a store or individual you can trust. Unless you have purchased the instrument only, your violin outfit should come with a violin with four strings, a bow, and a carrying case and most of the time a chin rest and rosin for your bow. In most cases, the person who sells you the violin will be happy to string it for you, which has the added bonus of double-checking to be sure the tuning pegs (the knobs at the scroll, or top, of the violin) are properly fit to the scroll. A hard case is important because violins are such delicate instruments.  Strings come in three basic varieties: gut, which is expensive and difficult to take care of, but which offers a complex range of sound; steel, which is loud and bright but can sound scratchy, and synthetic, which is smooth, clear, and not as unpredictable as gut. Each type's name refers to the core material around which metal wire is wrapped to create the string. Most beginners should go with synthetic core strings, such as nylon core.  The bow should be new, or newly re-haired. You can check this by looking at the hair of the bow (the fine, white or off-white fibers) and ensuring that the color is uniform and bright along its entire length. The hair of the bow should be a uniform width from end to end. Bows wear down over time. You can get your bow re-haired for a small fee at most music shops. Nearly all violinists use a chin rest, which is a cheap, ergonomic piece of (usually black) plastic that clamps near the base of the violin and allows it to be held securely by your chin. This is usually attached to the violin when the violin is built. Aside from that, be sure you have some rosin (coagulated sap) for your bow, a music stand, and a book of beginner lessons or songs, preferably in a format that will open flat.  Some violinists, especially beginners, also purchase a shoulder rest, which is a violin-width pad that sits on your shoulder underneath the violin and makes it easier to hold. Many people start with a shoulder rest and eventually remove it after a few years. If the violin seems to dig into your shoulder when you play, consider purchasing one. Fiddlers, if they sing while performing, often hold the violin in the crook of an arm while playing, with the butt resting against their shoulder. For them, chin rests and shoulder rests are generally pointless. A tuner is a small device that clips on to the scroll or the pegs of the violin. It is useful for beginners if you are teaching yourself, as it can be used to make sure you are playing the notes correctly. But once you know how to play the notes, the tuner isn't of much use anymore except for tuning the instrument itself. Be sure to take it off before big performances though, as it looks unprofessional. Summary:","output":"When starting out with the violin, you can expect to spend a few hundred dollars on a decent beginner's instrument.

Make sure the bow is new or newly re-haired, with uniform and bright hair. Use a chin rest for better support, and consider purchasing a shoulder rest if the violin digs into your shoulder. In the beginning, a tuner can also be helpful for accurate tuning and practicing notes, but it becomes less necessary as you gain experience. In addition to these essentials, you will need a music stand and beginner lesson books or songs that can open flat for easy learning."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

An adorable 3-year-old girl who suffered a heart attack during a dentist visit likely died because she was given the maximum dose of sedative drugs, according to an autopsy report. Finley Puleo Boyle, of Kailua in Honolulu, Hawaii, probably died because of the sedatives and local anesthesia that were administered during her December dental procedure, Honolulu Chief Medical Examiner Dr. Christopher Happy concluded in his autopsy report. He classified the death as an accident. The girl lapsed into a coma on December 3 in the office of Dr. Lilly Geyer at Island Dentistry for Children. She died on January 3. The office has since closed. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO. Finley Boyle, 3, died after being given sedatives during a standard dental procedure. Finley Boyle's devastated mother Ashley (right) took the little girl to the Island Dentistry for Children in Oahu, Hawaii on December 3. The autopsy report said the previously healthy girl had no signs of underlying heart problems or an allergic reaction to the array of sedatives and anesthetic she received in preparation for cavity fillings and root canals, the Honolulu Star-Advertiser reported Friday. The medical examiner noted her teeth were in good shape: 'the oral cavity has native dentition in good repair.' Finley received five drugs, according to the report, including Demerol, hydroxyzine and chlorohydrate. She was also given laughing gas and an injection of a local anesthetic, lidocaine with epinephrine. 'Immediately following the lidocaine injection, the decedent became unresponsive and went into cardiopulmonary arrest,' Happy said in his report. The girl lapsed into a coma on December 3 in the office of Dr. Lilly Geyer (center) at Island Dentistry for Children. The girl's mother Ashley Boyle (pictured) is traumatized by her daughter's death and has filed a negligence lawsuit against the dentist. Parents Ashley and Evan Boyle filed a negligence lawsuit while their only child was in a coma. Their attorney, Rick Fried, would not comment on the autopsy report. Geyer's attorney, John Nishimoto, has called the allegations 'unproven' but declined to comment further because of the lawsuit. He didn't respond to the newspaper's requests for comment on the autopsy report Thursday. Geyer was issued a license to practice dentistry in the state in July 2005, the Star-Advertiser has previously reported. As of last December, there were no records of complaints against her or her practice on file with the Hawaii Department Of Commerce and Consumer Affairs, according to the newspaper. Ms Boyle is being represented by attorney Richard Fried who called the maximum dosages of five different drugs 'grossly excessive'. He cited the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry's standards which warned that young children should be monitored every five minutes and that an extra person should be there to help in case resuscitation is needed. Immediately following the lidocaine injection, Finley Boyle became unresponsive and went into cardiopulmonary arrest. The procedure on December 3 broke both. of those rules. Instead of checking Finley's oxygen levels every five. minutes, records show she wasn't checked for 26 minutes which explains. why the brain damage was so severe. When. the girl went into cardiac arrest, a doctor from another office had to. be brought in to perform CPR - which Ms Boyle believes is the main. reason her daughter fell into a coma. Ms Boyle was left with the agonizing decision to not resuscitate her daughter, saying that although she held out hope that her daughter would recover she didn't want her to live in a vegetative state. 'Had it been initiated at the correct time, she'd be walking out of the hospital right now,' Boyle said.Finley. may not have even needed the fillings. Ms Boyle has been contacted by. others mothers who got second opinions after visiting Dr Geyer and found. out that her recommendations were 'either totally unnecessary or. somewhat unnecessary' according to Fried. Other mothers said their children had trouble walking for a few days after having work done by Dr Geyer. Ms Boyle calls the botched procedure a 'massive tragedy' that she and her family 'will have to deal with for the rest of our lives.' In January, new state rules took effect tightening oversight of dental sedation in Hawaii. Finley Puelo Boyle (pictured) is tragically missed by her mother, father, and all who knew her.

During her visit, they found out she needed some dental work like cavity fillings and root canals. To make Finley comfortable, the dentist gave her some medicine to help her relax and numb her mouth so it wouldn't hurt. But, sadly, she was given too much medicine, and it caused her heart to stop working properly. She got very sick and went into a coma, which means her body and mind were in a very deep sleep, and she couldn't wake up. After a month, little Finley passed away. Her parents were really sad and upset, because they thought the dentist should have been more careful with the medicine. So they decided to file a lawsuit, which is a way to take the dentist to court to find out who is responsible. Since this happened, the dentist's office was closed, and now there are new rules in Hawaii to make sure dentists are more careful with sedation medicine for kids."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Context: Additionally, genes can have regulatory regions many kilobases upstream or downstream of the open reading frame. These act by binding to transcription factors which then cause the DNA to loop so that the regulatory sequence (and bound transcription factor) become close to the RNA polymerase binding site. For example, enhancers increase transcription by binding an activator protein which then helps to recruit the RNA polymerase to the promoter; conversely silencers bind repressor proteins and make the DNA less available for RNA polymerase.

Scott Fitzgerald, a screenwriter who had his share of ups and downs in this land. Fitzgerald was not a successful Hollywood writer because he was not good at the career path he chose. He was an amazing novelist, but his efforts of turning them into screenplays ended in disappointment and confusion. It was because of a lack of potential for screenwriting as well as his addiction and desire to be famous. Growing up as a boy, Fitzgerald went to movies a lot. He wanted to write stories that would eventually turn into movies. The problem was: just because Fitzgerald wanted to do something didn't necessarily mean that he was good at it. He made his attempts, but most of these efforts ended in disappointment because he thought about the change from script to screen too much. His plot was too detailed and complicated; his tone was too serious or his dialogue too sentimental . Fitzgerald's quick rise to fame also led to his fall. In life, things are not meant to happen all at once, all that the same time but it did for Fitzgerald. At his best time, three of his early stories were made into short films, including The Great Gatsby and Babylon Revisited.

The player's eyes, which were initially filled with disappointment from the missed shot, now widen with disbelief as he and the two spectators behind him witness an extraordinary turn of events unfold on the basketball court. Hindered by the weight of the heavy defeat that seemed inevitable, the atmosphere in the arena changes as if a charged lightning bolt had just descended from the heavens above. With each passing second, the excitement increases, reaching a fever pitch that the audience can hardly contain. Inexplicably, the ball that had just ricocheted off the rim, spins through the air with an unusual trajectory, much like a boomerang defying gravity, and proceeds to curve its way toward the opposing team's basket. The players on both teams momentarily freeze in shock, attempting to process the incredible and bizarre scene before them. As the ball rapidly gains altitude, it's evident that every individual inside the packed stadium--from the most die-hard fan to the novice who is attending their first game--shares the same thought: Could this be a pivotal moment that reverses the tide and grants the underdog team the triumph they had all but given up on? Leaning forward in anticipation, the two men behind the player exchange awestruck glances, bewildered by the surreal display, which seemed to have plunged the game into an unprecedented dimension. Time seems to slow down as the ball, gleaming under the bright lights, draws closer and closer to the hoop that had moments earlier been in the clutches of what seemed an insurmountable lead. The tension mounts as onlookers silently pray, hoping that the sheer force of their collective will can somehow guide the ball along its unconventional and seemingly impossible path. Then, as if to defy all logic, the unthinkable happens: The ball, moving with a force and precision that defies explanation, hits the backboard at just the right angle, propelling itself through the net with a satisfying swoosh.

The once despondent player who had so confidently taken the shot seconds earlier, now finds himself surrounded by a sea of congratulatory pats and shouts of elation. In that surreal moment, as joy and disbelief intertwine, it becomes abundantly clear that the missed shot that had begun the sequence, was, in fact, no accident; rather, it was a testament to the triumph of the human spirit in the face of adversity, and a reminder that miracles can manifest in the most unexpected of ways.

The heroic female warrior Britomart (representing both chastity and Elizabeth I) battles through obstacles to reach the chamber in which Amoret is being held, and slays Busirane moments before he is able to kill Amoret.Britomart Redeems Faire Amoret was intended by Etty to illustrate the virtues of chastity and honour. It shows the moment in which Busirane is interrupted by Britomart as he prepares to kill Amoret. Amoret is chained to a gilded Solomonic column, carved with depictions of Venus, and her clothes fall from her shoulders as she struggles. Britomart, clad in armour, enters Busirane's Moorish chamber, and tramples a blood-stained grimoire as she swings her sword. Busirane, naked from the waist up and with Chinese-style trousers and queue, falls to the floor, his blade still pointing at Amoret's heart. Unusually for Etty, Britomart is painted very thinly, with the canvas weave still visible through the paint. Art historian Alison Smith considers that this was likely inspired by Henry Fuseli, who painted a depiction of Britomart using the same style of painting.In the original poem, Busirane had tortured and cut out the heart of the still-living Amoret by the time of her rescue. When he came to paint Britomart Redeems Faire Amoret Etty had created numerous scenes of combat and death, and would later achieve a degree of critical approbation when it became known that he visited mortuaries to sketch cadavers to ensure the accuracy of his depictions of bodies in varying stages of decomposition.

Democrats Under Ethics Cloud Benefit From Distracted Public Rep. Jane Harman awaits President Obama's address to a joint session of Congress. Feb. 24, 2009 (AP) Allegations of ethics violations by a handful of Democrats in recent months reached something of a crescendo this week as two prominent members of Congress were accused of corruption. California Rep. Jane Harman denied allegations that she offered to help seek reduced charges for two pro-Israel lobbyists suspected of espionage in exchange for help from a pro-Israel donor, also suspected Israeli agent, in lobbying House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to give Harman a key chairmanship. And California Sen. Dianne Feinstein denied that she devised legislation that helped her husband get a federal contract to sell foreclosed properties at compensation rates higher than the industry norms. But the latest cases, which involve Democrats, did not make the same splash that corruption allegations did a few years ago, when Republicans were on the receiving end of the finger-pointing. Some Republican analysts attribute the difference to timing. Democrats have benefited from an \\"Obama media cycle,\\" said Republican strategist Ron Bonjean, who served as an aide to former House Speaker Dennis Hastert and Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott. Reporters are struggling to keep up with the Obama administration and all the crises it's grappling with, Bonjean told FOXNews.com. In addition, he said, the media and the public have become more desensitized to allegations of corruption against lawmakers after the ones against Republicans. GOP consultant Joe Gaylord, who served as an aide to former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, told FOXNews.com he believes GOP values and principles played a role in garnering more attention to ethics accusations against Republican lawmakers. \\"Republicans who have generally used the ethics process become much more susceptible to the hypocrisy charges because they set a high standard for how people should behave,\\" he said. \\"Then when a Republican doesn't behave properly, it becomes a bigger story.\\" A succession of reports and scandals against congressional Republicans ranging from pay-to-play schemes to salacious affairs began more than four years ago when then-House Majority Leader Tom DeLay was questioned about his overseas travel and ties to lobbyist Jack Abramoff, who was under federal investigation. Ohio Rep. Bob Ney also got entangled in the Abramoff scandal, and ended up in jail. Another Republican, Rep. Randy \\"Duke\\" Cunningham, resigned his California seat in 2005 after pleading guilty to accepting 2.4 million in bribes and underreporting his income for 2004. In 2006, Florida Rep. Mark Foley resigned when it was learned that he had exchanged raunchy e-mails with a teenage boy who was a former congressional page. In 2007, Idaho Sen. Larry Craig was arrested and pleaded guilty to an undercover sex sting in a men's bathroom at a Minneapolis airport. All five lawmakers are gone from office now. The cumulative effect of these incidents created a perception that Republicans were ethically challenged. Even before Craig's \\"wide stance,\\" Democrats were able to seize on the allegations and regain control of Capitol Hill in 2006, in part by repeating the mantra that they would wipe away the \\"culture of corruption\\" in Congress. But in recent months, Democrats have fallen victim to similar allegations of corruption. While denying wrongdoing on Tuesday, Harman called for a federal investigation into why her conversations were being recorded and why they were leaked to the media. The Office of Congressional Ethics, created by a House resolution on March , 11, 2008, also won't take up the Harman investigation, according to Roll Call, because the OCE rules prevent it from looking at any cases that arose before its creation. Feinstein defended herself Wednesday by pointing out that her legislation to route 25 billion in taxpayer money to a government agency that reportedly awarded her husband's real estate firm a lucrative contract never was enacted into law. Another Democrat, Pennsylvania Rep. Jack Murtha, is facing a federal probe for purportedly steering defense appropriations to clients of KSA Consulting, which employed his brother Robert, and the PMA Group, founded by Paul Magliocchetti, a former senior staffer on the Appropriations Committee Subcommittee on Defense. New York Rep. Charlie Rangel is being investigated by the House Ethics Committee in at least four areas, including his reported failure to properly report income taxes on a Caribbean villa in the Dominican Republic; use of four, rent-controlled apartments in Harlem; questions about an offshore firm asking Rangel for special tax exemptions; and whether Rangel improperly used House stationery to solicit donations for a school of public affairs named after him at City College of New York. Melanie Sloan, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, said the main difference between the current Democratic scandals and the ones that routed the Republicans is that now \\"it's not one big scandal easily understood.\\" She explained that many of ethics accusations against Republicans a few year ago were linked to Abramoff. \\"It was one issue,\\" she said. \\"Now we're looking at lots of different little issues.\\" But she warned that the allgegations against Democrats could add up to a death by a thousand cuts. \\"The Democrats have something to worry about here,\\" she said. \\"There will be a critical mass when it will look like Democrats have a huge ethical problem. And the Democrats who have not been taking the problems very seriously ignore them at their peril.\\" Bonjean when it comes to rallying voter outrage \\"timing is everything.\\" Right now, the focus of anti-tax tea partiers and others critical of Washington is on government spending, bank bailouts, legal rights for terror suspects and Bush administration-era interrogation techniques. \\"There's only so much oxygen in the room for what it is that's going to get covered and what becomes important,\\" added Gaylord. \\"And in this age, when there is a crisis a minute ... it moves the individual activities of congressmen and congresswomen, no matter how corrupt it might be, down on the scale of importance. \\"The Obama administration, with everything it is changing, is providing cover for Democratic corruption,\\" he said. What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"The article discusses how allegations of ethics violations involving Democratic members of Congress have not attracted as much attention as similar allegations against Republicans in the past. The author suggests that the current focus on the Obama administration and a desensitized public could be contributing factors. In recent months, multiple Democrats have faced accusations of corruption, but these cases have not generated the same level of media coverage or public outrage. Some experts warn that Democrats should not ignore these allegations, as they could lead to long-term consequences if they are perceived as having a significant ethical problem."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here are three steps to take when applying to colleges for the best chances at getting into the best college for you. Step l: Making A List Of Colleges To Apply To With over 6,000 colleges in the United States, the first step in applying to college is to do some research and make a college list .

Many limit the number because applications are accompanied by a fee.          . Step2: Splitting The List Into Target, Reach and Safety Schools In general, students will want to apply to three types of schools: Target, Reach and Safety schools. It is up to you how many applications you send, but a good mix would be more target than reach, and at least one safety. You will need to take your list, and now decide which are your top picks, which are attainable for you academically, which are affordable for you only with aid, and refine your broad list into a group of schools that gives you the best chance for success.

If the water depth is sufficiently shallow, the wave crest become steeper and the trough gets broader and shallower; finally, the ocean waves break at the shore. The motions of wave breaking are different with along to the steepness of shores and waves, and can be categorized by below three types.[11][12] Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided, the Coral beach with nice sand and deeper water is less suitable for surfing and windsurfing compared to Surfer beach, which has shallow water. The wave characteristics play a crucial role in determining the suitability of a beach for surfing and windsurfing. As ocean waves approach the shore, the waves change their heights and lengths due to the slowing of wave velocity. The wave height becomes higher and the wavelength becomes shorter. If the water depth is sufficiently shallow, the wave crest becomes steeper and the trough gets broader and shallower, eventually causing the ocean waves to break at the shore. The motions of wave breaking vary depending on the steepness of the shores and the waves, and can be categorized into three main types. In the case of Coral beach, the deeper water makes it less ideal for surfing and windsurfing. The deep water doesn't allow the waves to develop the necessary steepness and breaking motions that are conducive to surfing or windsurfing activities as the waves may not slow down enough or break properly near the shore. It does, however, make the beach a more desirable destination for families as they can enjoy swimming and playing in the sand without worrying about strong waves. On the other hand, Surfer beach offers shallow water, which is more suitable for surfing and windsurfing. The shallow water allows the waves to slow down and break near the shore, creating steeper crests and broader, shallower troughs that facilitate surfing and windsurfing. The wave characteristics provided by the shallow water and the breaking motions of the waves make Surfer beach the preferred location for surfers. Overall, Surfer beach is more suitable for surfing and windsurfing due to its shallow water, which results in the desirable wave characteristics necessary for these activities. In contrast, the deep water at Coral beach makes it less ideal for surfing and windsurfing but more appropriate for family-oriented activities such as swimming and beach play."},{"instruction":"Given the question: Process: - Oxygen enters the body through the mouth or nose - The oxygen travels into the lungs - The oxygen binds to hemoglobin proteins within erythrocytes (red blood cells) - The erythrocytes are pumped through the body by the heart - All cells receive the oxygen.

Old English developed from a set of Anglo-Frisian or North Sea Germanic dialects originally spoken by Germanic tribes traditionally known as the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes. As the Anglo-Saxons became dominant in England, their language replaced the languages of Roman Britain: Common Brittonic, a Celtic language, and Latin, brought to Britain by Roman invasion. Old English had four main dialects, associated with particular Anglo-Saxon kingdoms: Mercian, Northumbrian, Kentish and West Saxon. It was West Saxon that formed the basis for the literary standard of the later Old English period, although the dominant forms of Middle and Modern English would develop mainly from Mercian. The speech of eastern and northern parts of England was subject to strong Old Norse influence due to Scandinavian rule and settlement beginning in the 9th century.

Please answer the following question: What is creativity? How de we define creativity? Where does creativity come from? How philosophical is the notion of creativity? Is everyone’s ‘creativity’ different? Or is it an ill conceived, simplified term that is used to describe a very specific series of neuronal & bodily reactions to certain stimuli? These are all the questions I’ve been thinking (and googling, and youtubing) since beginning this Capturing Creativity studio* and I have found some answers or maybe I’ve just found more questions: Creativity is generally defined as the ability to make new things, or come up with new ideas, it’s an ability to think outside the box, to see unique solutions and employ them in inventive ways. In this sense creativity is not always utilised when being ‘creative’, as to be creative is simply defined as the ability to make or produce something. However I guess that depends on your definition of creative, how different, unique, special, once off, un-influenced does something have to be, to be classified as creative? This is where creativity get’s tricky. It’s all well and good to be like oh this is what creativity is, so it’s easy to investigate it, but what if you don’t define that as being creative, maybe that was just following a formula, a somewhat inspired formula, but maybe it is just a formula. Creativity to most people seems to be a random mix of once off genius combined with solid skill and hard work and for us humans these percentages are unique to us. Maybe creativity to you is 90% unique idea, 5% skill and 5% hard work. Maybe creativity to you is 40% unique idea, 50% skill and 10% hard work. Maybe for you creativity doesn’t have to involve any hard work at all. For me when it comes to creativity I’m most interested in that unique idea portion; where does that unique idea come from? Is it simply random? Is it a gift from the gods? Is our unique idea just a product of a lot of subconscious effort, only made aware to us in the sense of a ‘random’ idea?

How can I meet a verified hacker without getting scammed? Where can I hire a hacker? Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","output":"Yes, these two questions are inquiring about the same information - how to find and hire a legitimate hacker without getting scammed. Here's a detailed answer to help guide you through this process: 1. Know your needs: Before looking for a hacker, it's important to have a clear understanding of what you need the hacker for, as this can impact the type of hacker you're searching for. There are various types/types of hackers, including ethical (white hat), criminal (black hat), and those who sit somewhere in between (grey hat). It is recommended that you search for ethical hackers, as they use their skills for legitimate purposes and are less likely to scam you. 2. Research: Once you know what you need, start by doing thorough research. Look through forums like HackForums, exploit, or GitHub repositories for projects related to your needs. Read reviews, feedback, and user experiences to gather more information about potential hacking services. It's best to use this research to compile a list of potential hacking candidates. 3. Verify their reputation: Dig deep into the reputation of the hacker you intend to work with. Check their references, reviews, ratings, and look for any red flags or warning signs that might indicate scams or unethical behavior. Reach out to the contacts provided for verification or ask for recommendations from reliable sources. 4. Look for certifications: Professional hackers (ethical hackers) usually possess some certifications, such as Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH), Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP), or Global Information Assurance Certification (GIAC). These certifications help confirm that the individual is a legitimately skilled and knowledgeable professional in the field of ethical hacking. 5. Direct contact: Reach out to the potential hacker and discuss your needs. Be mindful of how they communicate and respond to your queries – a legitimate hacker will be more likely to have good communication skills and display professionalism. Trust your instincts – if something feels off or too good to be true, consider looking elsewhere. 6. Ask for a written agreement: When hiring a hacker, make sure to get a written contract or agreement stating the terms, conditions, scope of work, and pricing. This not only helps avoid miscommunication but also adds a layer of protection from potential fraud or scams. 7. Stay cautious: Remember that providing sensitive information or access to your personal data is a risk. Avoid sharing passwords or critical information until you feel confident in the hacker's legitimacy and professionalism. 8. Keep a record: Document your communication with the hacker, including emails, agreements, invoices, and reports, in case any disputes or issues arise in the future. 9. Escrow Services: In case of making any payments, opt for an escrow service if possible. An escrow service is a third-party that holds the payment until the agreed terms and conditions are met. This ensures the security of your funds and reduces the likelihood of scams or frauds. Please note that this guidance is geared towards helping you find and work with ethical hackers or professionals who specialize in cybersecurity and are not intended to assist in hiring individuals for malicious or illegal activities. It's crucial to stay within the boundaries of the law when seeking assistance from professionals in the hacking world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

However, it does not directly answer the question of why the Chinese government denounced the accord. To provide a comprehensive response to this question, we need to consider the Simla Accord of 1914 and the broader political context of the time. The Simla Accord was a convention signed in 1914 between British India, Tibet, and China, which sought to define the boundaries between Tibet, British India (particularly in the region of what is now Arunachal Pradesh), and China. A central aspect of the accord was the McMahon Line, a boundary proposed by British colonial administrator Sir Henry McMahon, which delineated the borders between India's northeastern states and Tibet. The Chinese government denounced the Simla Accord for several reasons: 1. Territorial sovereignty: China refuted the McMahon Line as a demarcation because it encroached upon what it claimed to be traditional Chinese territory. The McMahon Line placed a large swath of land, known today as Arunachal Pradesh, within the boundaries of British India. China insisted that this was an unjustified appropriation of its territory and violated its territorial sovereignty. 2. Non-recognition of Tibet's autonomy: The Republic of China, established by the Xinhai Revolution, viewed Tibet as an integral part of its territory and did not recognize its autonomy. By engaging in negotiations with British India and Tibet as equal parties, the Simla Accord seemed to undermine China's assertions about its sovereignty over Tibet, which was unacceptable to the Chinese government. 3. Perceived British imperialism: The Chinese government, during the 19th and early 20th centuries, had been repeatedly pushed into unequal treaties and forced concessions by European powers, particularly Great Britain. The Chinese government saw the Simla Accord as another example of British imperialism, using diplomacy to achieve territorial gains at the expense of China. 4. Unfair representation and coercion: China did not believe they had fair representation at the Simla Convention, as they were not involved in the drafting of the boundary agreement between British India and Tibet. They also felt coerced into signing the accord, as the participants threatened to sign a bilateral agreement between Britain and Tibet if China refused, further undermining China's claims to both land and political control of the region. To sum up, the Chinese government denounced the Simla Accord for a combination of factors, some of which are intertwined. China's territorial sovereignty, concerns over the recognition of Tibet's autonomy, perceived British imperialism, and an objection to the negotiation process of the convention led the Chinese government to denounce the accord and continue to contest the legitimacy of the defined borders today."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Build a movie plot around this: Who mistakes his gun for an asthma inhaler? Wheezy Joe The answer to this question is:","output":"Title: \\"Wheezy Joe's Unfortunate Mix-Up\\" Genre: Action / Comedy / Drama Plot: Wheezy Joe (played by a talented comedic actor), a small-time crook with a reputation for pulling off clever heists, suffers from severe asthma. His trusted inhaler is vital for keeping him alive amid all the fast-paced action. With his last big heist unfinished, Wheezy Joe is constantly on the run. Tensions rise when Wheezy Joe inadvertently switches his asthma inhaler with a miniature firearm, a gift from his late mentor. In the midst of robbing the biggest bank in the city, Wheezy Joe experiences a severe asthma attack. As he grasps for his inhaler, he accidentally pulls out the miniature gun instead. Realizing the mistake, but with no other choice, he uses the tiny weapon to maintain control of the bank and quell rising panic among hostages. Simultaneously, a determined detective named Samantha \\"Sam\\" Lewis (played by an experienced dramatic actress), who has been following Wheezy Joe's criminal career for years, discovers crucial new evidence tying him to his past heists. As she races to the bank to apprehend Joe, she finds her own secret weapon: a genuine understanding of Wheezy Joe's medical condition. Inside the bank, Wheezy Joe bonds with an unlikely group of hostages, including a rebellious teenager named Lily, a kind elderly woman named Edna, and a charming man named Tom who has a knack for calming situations. Together, they form a ragtag team, discovering a plot twist: the bank's manager is involved in a money-laundering scheme, making Wheezy Joe's inadvertent intervention actually beneficial. As the police, led by Detective Sam Lewis, surround the bank, tension reaches an all-time high. Sam manages to contact Wheezy Joe, offering him an asthma inhaler so he can breathe easily. Recognizing her compassion, Wheezy Joe chooses to trust Sam and reveals the bank manager's scheme. Sam works with the police to arrest the corrupt bank manager while granting Wheezy Joe and his newfound friends leniency in their legal battles. Having found redemption, Wheezy Joe abandons his life of crime to open a small trinket shop with Tom, Edna, and Lily. The story concludes with a moment of touching comedy: Wheezy Joe hangs up the miniature gun, now permanently retired, behind the counter of the shop. He looks down at his asthma inhaler, taking a deep breath, finally content with his new life."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Where might Jenny be?  A. friend's house  B. hotel  C. school  D. party  E. office  The best answer is A:","output":"E. Office Jenny's actions in the scenario paint the picture of a professional setting. The responsibilities she handles, such as answering the phone, taking messages, and handling information about significant projects, typically point towards a job role that involves administrative or secretarial duties. These duties are commonly undertaken in an office environment.  Option A, a friend's house, likely would not provide an appropriate setting for managing such professional tasks, especially those involving the transmission of critical information about a major project. Option B, a hotel, unless specified, generally isn't the default setting for such work, unless Jenny is traveling for work and her hotel room has been temporarily transformed into a mobile office. However, the information given does not suggest this. Option C, a school, is a possible place for work or a job setting, but it usually involves a different set of tasks related to education, teaching, or academic administration. The duties of answering generic work calls and managing project-related information typically don't fall under common school-related responsibilities. Jenny's actions don't align with the usual tasks seen in this environment. Option D, a party, arguably is an even less likely setting. It's a place usually designated for leisure, recreation, or celebration, not carrying out professional work-related tasks.

Q:Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: Who hits his head on the cannon?  Donald Duck is doing some camouflage painting on a cannon with yellow, green, and red stripes and black dots (based on the colors of the Flag of Lithuania with bullet holes in it). Sergeant Pete sees it and scolds Donald, explaining that it needs to painted so it can't be seen.  Pete then demands that Donald re-paint the cannon to make it \\"hard to see\\".  Obliging to the sergeant's orders, Donald walks to the \\"Experimental Laboratory: Camouflage Corps\\", disregarding the 'keep out' sign, and walks in. He finds some \\"invisible paint\\", which he tests with his finger, and uses it to paint the cannon. When Pete returns, he is shocked to find the cannon seemingly gone, believing it to be stolen.  But of course it isn't stolen, as the sergeant finds out the hard way by bonking his head on the underside of the cannon and discovering Donald inside.  Angered that Donald painted the cannon too invisible to see, Pete blows hard into one end of the barrel, sending Donald out the other end and into the bucket of invisible paint.  When Donald runs away, Pete finds out Donald has become invisible after seeing Donald's footprints on the ground.  Donald then swims across a lake, but the invisible paint doesn't come off. Pete continues to chase Donald through a field of flowers, until he accidentally throws some of the flowers on Donald, revealing his outline.  Pete spots Donald and tries to catch him, but he gets away again.  However, this gives Pete an idea to find Donald.  When the General drives up, Pete's antics, including jumping around a tree while singing \\"Here We Go Round The Mulberry Bush\\" and throwing flowers, convinces the General that he is acting odd, especially after he asks the General \\"did you see a little guy that you can't see?\\"  The invisible Donald then puts a cactus down Pete's pants, making him scream in pain and jump around like a madman, making the General wonder what is going on with Pete.

The secretary/music director for the church, Anne (Susan Clark), is wary of the changes Hill intends to implement. Hill wants to get people involved, and asks the elderly Mrs. Rose Rafferty (Patsy Kelly) to handle the church's sinking fund.On his first Sunday, Hill learns from Mrs. Rafferty that her gambling husband Delaney (Douglas Fowley) bet all the sinking fund money on a horse race. Hill delivers a sermon less than 15 seconds long, then rapidly escorts Mrs. Rafferty out the church as astonished worshipers watch. She leads him to the bookie, hidden behind a dry-cleaning shop, and meets Harry the Hat (Alan Hale, Jr.), who recommends that Hill let the bet ride. Hill's horse loses and he is thrown out of the betting parlor. Hill summons the police, but the booking joint has been skillfully removed.That evening, Hill delivers a tirade against the organized crime in the city during a local television broadcast. He is chastised by his presbytery superiors for the tirade, and is urged to go out and build church membership in the area.

Article: There is a Web site called the \\"World Database of Happiness.\\" It combines and analyzes the results of hundreds of surveys from around the world that have been conducted on life satisfaction. Most of the findings are predictable, but a few are surprising. The database makes it clear that there is not a strong connection between material wealth and general contentment. It is a cliche to say that money can't buy happiness, but the old saying seems to be supported by research. Many people still cling to the belief that gaining riches will be the answer to all their problems, yet they are probably mistaken. Studies have been carried out on people who acquired sudden wealth, such as lottery winners. In most cases, after the initial joy had worn off, people were not left with a sense of lasting happiness. In fact, they tended to revert to the way they felt before they became rich. Previously contented people continue to be contented, while those who were miserable before sink back into misery. If material wealth does not bring happiness, then what does? Perhaps happiness has something to do with where you live. The authorities at the World Database on Happiness have surveyed levels of happiness in different countries. Apparently, people in America, Canada, and Singapore are very happy; people living in India and Russia, not surprisingly, are not happy. Other surveys consistently point to the importance of relationships. Family relationships in particular seem to be the key to long-term contentment. The Web site suggests that falling in love and having children are two of the situations that bring the greatest happiness. Nowadays people look to technology as an alternative source of satisfaction. People increasingly spend more time alone watching TV or surfing the Internet rather than spending time with family. Can technology truly make people happy? It is too difficult to tell, but one thing is sure: If the Web site's research is accurate, time spent with your family is a better investment than time spent making money. Question: Which description is right according to the passage? Options: A: The material wealth and general contentment are strongly connected with each other. B: The more one's wealth is, the happier he will be. C: Many people have wrong concept towards the relation between love and money. D: Money can solve all the problems.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Mike was interested in the science behind polar compounds. To that end, he collected two compounds, compound A and compound B. Compound A was a polar compound, but compound B was a nonpolar compound. He then conducted two tests, case A and case B. In case A, he changed the state of a polar compound from solid to liquid. And, in case B, he changed the state of a nonpolar compound from solid to liquid.  Which test would need higher temperature, case A or case B?  Hint: Changes of state from solid to liquid and from liquid to gas occur when matter gains energy. The energy allows individual molecules to separate and move apart from one another. It takes more energy to bring about these changes of state for polar molecules. Although hydrogen bonds are weak, they add to the energy needed for molecules to move apart from one another, so it takes higher temperatures for these changes of state to occur in polar compounds. This explains why polar compounds have relatively high melting and boiling points. The Table below compares melting and boiling points for some polar and nonpolar covalent compounds. A:","output":"Based on the hint provided, we can infer that polar compounds generally have higher melting and boiling points compared to nonpolar compounds. This is because polar molecules have stronger intermolecular forces, such as hydrogen bonds, which require more energy to overcome before the molecules can move apart and change states from solid to liquid or liquid to gas. In Mike's experiments, compound A is a polar compound, and compound B is a nonpolar compound. When comparing case A (changing the state of a polar compound from solid to liquid) and case B (changing the state of a nonpolar compound from solid to liquid), it would require a higher temperature to achieve this state change in case A, the polar compound. The additional energy needed for case A is due to the hydrogen bonds and other intermolecular forces present in the polar compound. These forces hold the molecules together more strongly than the forces in nonpolar compounds. Consequently, more energy is required in the form of higher temperatures to separate the molecules and change the state of the substance in case A. To sum up, case A, the test involving changing the state of the polar compound (compound A) from solid to liquid, would require a higher temperature than case B, which involves changing the state of the nonpolar compound (compound B) from solid to liquid."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","output":"No, the answer you found about 13 million wireless users does not correctly address the question you asked about the year Digicel was founded in Trinidad. The information regarding the number of wireless users is likely related to the company's customer base but does not indicate the specific year the company started operations in Trinidad. To provide a comprehensive answer, Digicel Group, a multinational telecommunications company, was founded by Irish entrepreneur Denis O'Brien in April 2001. Headquartered in Jamaica, Digicel initially started its operations in the Caribbean region, providing mobile services. Specifically, Digicel Trinidad and Tobago, which is a subsidiary of Digicel Group, was launched in Trinidad and Tobago on 12th November 2005. Since its establishment in the twin-island nation, Digicel has grown to be one of the largest mobile service providers offering a variety of services, including voice, messaging, data, and enterprise solutions. The company has since expanded throughout Central America, the Caribbean, and the Pacific. In summary, Digicel was founded in Trinidad and Tobago in 2005.

Should I validate this answer?  [1]. No [2]. Yes Answer:","output":"This question concerns the identification and classification of an SD memory card reader. Before validating the suggested answer, it's crucial to understand what an SD memory card reader is fundamentally.  An SD (Secure Digital) card reader is a device that allows computers to read SD cards, which are typically used in many electronics for storage, such as digital cameras, mobile phones, and media players. It facilitates the transfer of data between the card and the device. These are commonly connected to the device via USB and come in various shapes and sizes, which can accommodate a single SD card or multiple cards of varying formats. The suggested answer provides a classification based on the type and quantity of the card slots. It introduces the concept of single card readers that solely accept one SD card, multi card readers that are capable of reading varied types of cards (for example, SD, microSD, CompactFlash etc.), and series card readers that can take multiple SD cards simultaneously.  Although the suggested answer appropriately describes these categories and gives examples, it isn't completed as it doesn't provide the definition of an SD memory card reader. The answer could be improved by providing a brief definition at the beginning. So, to conclude, while the proposed answer partakes some relevant and correct information, it should not be validated as a perfect and comprehensive response to the question. It would be appropriate to include a clear and concise definition of an SD memory card reader for optimum understanding. For example, an improved answer could be: \\"An SD memory card reader is a device that allows computers and other devices to read Secure Digital (SD) cards, facilitating the transfer of data between the card and the device. Depending on the type and quantity of the card slots, these readers can be classified into three main categories: single card reader, multi card reader, and series card reader. A single card reader (e.g., 1x SD-only) is designed to accommodate one type of card. A multi card reader (e.g., 9-in-1) can read multiple types of cards, and series card reader (e.g., 4x SD only) has the capacity to read multiple cards of the same type simultaneously.\\".

He is confronted by rival archaeologist RenÃ© Belloq and the indigenous Hovito people. Surrounded and outnumbered, Indy surrenders the idol to Belloq and escapes aboard a waiting floatplane. Jones returns to his teaching position at Marshall College, where he is interviewed by two Army Intelligence agents. They inform him that the Nazis are searching for his old mentor, Abner Ravenwood, under whom Jones studied at the University of Chicago. The Nazis know that Ravenwood is the leading expert on the ancient city of Tanis in Egypt, and that he possesses the headpiece of the Staff of Ra. Jones deduces that the Nazis are searching for the Ark of the Covenant; the Nazis believe that if they acquire the Ark their armies will become invincible. The Staff of Ra is the key to finding the Well of Souls, a secret chamber in which the Ark is buried. The agents authorize Jones to recover the Ark to prevent the Nazis from obtaining it. He travels to Nepal and discovers that Abner has died, and the headpiece is in the possession of Ravenwood's daughter Marion. Jones visits Marion at her tavern, where she reveals her bitter feelings toward him from a previous romantic affair. She physically rebuffs his offer to buy the headpiece, and Jones leaves.

Please write a short summary for the following article: BBC - Travel - Living in: Rome : Living in..., Rome One of Italy's most treasured four-wheel inventions, the Fiat 500L. (Holger Leue/LPI) Rome is quite possibly the worldâs most romantic city and even a weekend visitor can feel entirely at home here. It is easy to fall madly in love with the tones of amber and rose and terracotta, the ancient villas and pillars, the effortless chic of both men and women and the eminently walkable neighborhoods, each one distinct. It is no wonder the city has a thriving ex-pat community, eager to fit in and enjoy la bella figura. What is it known for? Rome's history is part of its present: walking around the deserted Circus Maximus or through the Roman Forum, the ghosts of the city come alive. But it is certainly not weighing anyone down, or slowing them down, as you will find if you attempt to drive in Rome. You will find that the rhythm of life (outside of a car) is important to the citizens: where you have your morning espresso, taking time to enjoy lunch or dinner, having family supplies of homemade wine. When in Rome, do as the Romans do and enjoy yourself. Romans are spoiled with great restaurants and markets, truly affordable public transport and some of Europe's best shopping when the monster sales are on in January and July, making the Euro go farther. The politics might be an eternal mess in the Eternal City, but it makes up for it with magical sights like the moment at dusk when the bulk of St Peter's Basilica is traced in black against a purple sky. Where do you want to live? Although many people want to live in the neighborhoods of Rome's historic center, such as Trastevere, it is expensive and there is little green space. \\"There is a lot of smog and it is not near many parks,\\" said Nina Farrell, club manager of the American International Club of Rome. Another popular area is Prati, a wealthy and beautiful neighborhood with great shopping. Piazza Bologna, a bit further out near the University of Rome, is more affordable and residential and only a few metro stops from the city center. Side trips If you're anxious to see the Duomo di Milano or Michelangelo's David, you can catch frequent trains north to Florence (a mere hour and a half on the Eurostar), Milan and Venice. Or head south to Sperlonga and Naples, or venture farther afield for adventures like skiing in the Dolomites (less than five hours by train) and exploring the hill towns of Sicily, a short flight away. Rome is also a great jumping off point for day trips to Tivoli and the Villa d'Este, or the beautiful gardens at Villa Lante in Bagnaia. For devoted and determined shoppers, the Fashion District outlet stores (www.fashiondistrict.it) in Valmontone will be a sure destination. Practical info Housing is expensive, especially as you get closer to the city's center, and the market does not seem to have taken a hit in the current recession. Most of what is for sale is apartments, not houses, and many people rent. \\"You can spend half a million euros and get an apartment with no balcony, no land,\\" said Farrell. It is not only the prices that put people off, but the red tape and expense ­- a notary might get up to 10 to 15,000 euros for an closing or exchange. \\"It takes a long time to buy,\\" said Farrell, who has been through the process herself. But while the process is somewhat complicated, steady high prices and demand mean that property is a solid investment.

Bea, a five-year-old girl, was born with a severe illness which means she has to be kept away from other children of her age, because her body is so weak that she would be unable to fight off a common cold. Bea was diagnosed with this disease when she was five months old. Since then, the hospital has become her second home, medicines for food, and all kinds of treatments her friends. Bea received a very special treatment when she was four years old, which would allow her to be like a normal child if successful. After that, she spent two weeks in ICU before living for four months on a separate ward . Bea was allowed home in February but still needed a special tube in her nose to send in medicines every two days. Her parents clean the house from top to bottom every two days and hoover each morning to make sure Bea is free from any possible bacteria. Anna, Bea's mother, said, \\"she is weak but so strong.

James Dean with a camera (and whip): Robert Mapplethorpe the film star Robert Mapplethorpe was born for the big screen. The controversial photographer who died in 1989 at the age of just 42, after a fight with Aids, was dashing, dark and dangerous. He imagines himself as some kind of sinister screen idol – James Dean reinvented by David Lynch – in a self-portrait out of which he gazes with sexually charged insolence, macho in black leather jacket and slicked hair, cigarette hanging from his lips, a dark star from Hollywood’s nightmares. Now he is to hit the big screen posthumously in both a documentary and a biopic. Mapplethorpe: Look at the Pictures has just shown at Sundance, and while this factual examination of his art and life is gathering acclaim, it has also emerged that Matt Smith – yes, him, the Eleventh Doctor – is to play Mapplethorpe in a film currently titled simply Mapplethorpe. Smith played the Doctor as a bow-tied embodiment of geekiness who insisted “bow ties are cool.” As Mapplethorpe, will he state a preference for bullwhips ? He can certainly do the hair. In fact, it seems great casting. But the fascinating thing here is how an artist’s life story – and the way it is told – can shape art history. In his lifetime, Robert Mapplethorpe was highly contentious, and not just because of the provocative content of some of his art. His photographs of the male nude and of gay sadomasochist subculture saw him attacked by the American right, with Senator Jesse Helms denouncing his art in Congress. Yet he also divided critics whose own views were impeccably liberal. Was he a serious artist or a sub-Warholian celebrity of shock? Mapplethorpe was one of the 1980s New York artists (Basquiat another) who flirted with pop culture and set out to be “art stars”. Serious critics disdained Mapplethorpe. Robert Hughes in particular scorned “the mannered, postmodern chic of his images” and labelled him a “small talent.” And yet, as Mapplethorpe fades into history he grows in stature. This is partly to do with storytelling and memory. When the Italian artist and writer Giorgio Vasari invented art history in 1550, he did it by telling racy life stories. His sensational masterpiece The Lives of the Artists is still enjoyed today as a collection of biographies; only very dedicated readers discover it has an underlying theoretical argument. Vasari’s insight that to get his friends remembered, he must make their lives exciting, is still true. And by and large it is the artists whose lives would (and often do) make a good film who are remembered. The sufferings of Frida Kahlo and Vincent van Gogh have made them far more famous than artists who just taught at art school or worked steadily for 60 years (the genius of Mike Leigh’s recent film Mr Turner was to break this rule by telling the story of an artist whose life was not really very cinematic at all). Mapplethorpe had a life to make Vasari weep – with compassion, but also with joy at its sheer narrative gold. The all-American kid who sets out to find fame and fortune in late 1960s New York, falls in love with a brilliant young poetess, then discovers he is gay; who lives with her anyway at the Chelsea Hotel as they both explore their different creative passions. He finally becomes a glamorous “art star” drawn to dark erotic themes while she evolves from Rimbaud-reading bookshop clerk to the goddess of punk. He also has his Vasari. Mapplethorpe’s lifelong friend was, of course, that self-same poetess, Patti Smith, and her 2010 book Just Kids is one of the most beautiful memoirs of an artist ever written. It is very hard to look at Mapplethorpe coldly if you have read her tender – yet not uncritical – perceptions of him. He comes across intensely as someone who loved art, who was driven to do art. No saint, but some kind of martyr. Just Kids tells Mapplethorpe’s story with a candid elegance that matches many of the best American novels – its best parts have the finesse of Truman Capote. It is surely a book that will last, and with it Mapplethorpe must last, too. Smith has achieved with her words what Shakespeare promised his lover in Sonnet 18: “So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see / So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.” The only thing that surprises me, given the romantic eloquence of Just Kids, is that it has taken six years for someone to put together a biopic. Or perhaps it is no surprise. Mapplethorpe is not exactly family entertainment and the film in which Matt Smith will star is not big budget Hollywood production stuff. His story and his art still have a whiff of danger. That, of course, is the fascination. Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"Robert Mapplethorpe, the controversial photographer, is set to hit the big screen posthumously in both a documentary and biopic, having a significant impact on art history as the stories of his life - and the way they are told - can shape people's perception of him as an artist. As an artist with a life suited for a thrilling film narrative, Mapplethorpe's rise in stature is partly due to storytelling and memory, similar to how the lives and sufferings of Frida Kahlo and Vincent van Gogh contributed to their fame."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","output":"If plants die in soft mud more often, it would lead to a higher accumulation of organic materials in the sediment. This increased amount of organic material could potentially cause the remains to decompose at a faster rate due to increased microbial activity breaking down the organic matter. However, it could also lead to a higher rate of fossil formation due to a larger quantity of remains being preserved in the sediment. As for the second effect mentioned, which is the sediment building up over the remains, the increased frequency of plants dying in soft mud may lead to a more rapid accumulation of sediment. This could potentially have a \\"more\\" effect on the sedimentation rate, as more organic material would contribute to the volume of sediment that builds up over the remains. At the same time, it is essential to consider that several factors influence sedimentation and decomposition processes, such as the specific ecosystem, temperature, water/oxygen availability, and the presence of predators or decomposers. Ultimately, the increased rate of plants dying in soft mud would likely have a more significant effect on both the remains' decomposition and sediment buildup over the remains.

Shiva also founded a production studio called Gidalya Pictures. Can we infer the following? Alexandra Elizabeth Shiva is of Indian descent","output":"From the information provided, it is not entirely accurate to infer that Alexandra Elizabeth Shiva is of Indian descent. Her professional background and achievements as an American film producer and director are clear, with notable accomplishments like her award-winning film \\"Bombay Eunuch\\" (2001) and the documentary \\"How to Dance in Ohio\\" (2015) which was showcased at the Sundance Film Festival. The formation of her production studio, Gidalya Pictures, further highlights her thriving career in the film industry. However, this information does not necessarily serve as a confirmation of her ethnic or ancestral background. While the title of one of her films, \\"Bombay Eunuch,\\" may suggest a connection to Indian culture, it could also be a result of her artistic interest or passion for exploring diverse societies and narratives through her work. To accurately determine Alexandra Elizabeth Shiva's descent, one would have to examine more personal information, such as her family history, parents, family tree, or any definitive records that reveal her lineage or relationships within the Indian community. This would provide a more reliable basis for asserting her heritage, as opposed to basing the conclusion on the subjects she has explored in her films. In summary, without further information about Alexandra Elizabeth Shiva's personal and family background, we cannot definitively infer that she is of Indian descent.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What are the first names of the people who hear a scream?  Laurel and Hardy are seated at a dockside where Stan is fishing. Ollie sees a notice in a newspaper which says one Ebeneezer Laurel has died and left a large estate. Parties interested in the estate should go to the Laurel mansion for the reading of the will. Stan can't remember if Ebeneezer is a relative or not but they decide to go to the mansion anyway. They arrive during a thunderstorm and discover that Ebeneezer had been murdered and that the police had placed the notice in the newspaper to draw all of the relatives together to find out who committed the crime. Stan and Ollie are shown to a bedroom to sleep overnight, which is the room in which Ebeneezer was murdered. They hear a strange noise and in the darkness see a pair of eyes which turns out to be a cat. They then hear a scream and decide to investigate. Meanwhile, the butler is calling all of the relatives to a study telling them they have a phone call. After sitting in a chair and lifting the handset of the phone, the lights go out, there is a scream and a sound like a door slamming, and the relative is never seen again. Stan and Ollie return to their bedroom and get into the bed but a bat has flown into their room and is under their covers, which causes them to panic and run downstairs. All of the other relatives have now disappeared and the butler calls Stan and Ollie to take a telephone call in the study. Ollie sits in the chair to take the call. This time, however, the lights stay on and it is revealed that the chair is affixed to a trapdoor into which each of the other relatives vanished. Ollie falls through the trapdoor, but is saved due to his having become wedged in the chair. The murderer (a man dressed in drag) appears through a secret door with a knife.

Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","output":"Yes, these two questions are asking about the same information. They both inquire about finding the empirical formula from a given percent composition. To find the empirical formula from a percent composition, you can follow these steps: 1. Determine the percentage composition: Make sure you have the information about the percentage composition of each element in the compound. 2. Convert percentages to mass: Since percentages represent the parts of a substance per hundred, you can assume a total mass of 100 grams. In this way, the percentage of each element becomes its mass in grams. 3. Convert mass to moles: Divide the mass of each element by its molar mass (atomic weight) to find the number of moles of each element. The molar mass can be found on the periodic table. 4. Find the mole ratio: Divide the moles of each element by the smallest number of moles to obtain a whole number ratio. If the result is not a whole number, multiply all the ratios by the smallest possible value to get a whole number. 5. Determine empirical formula: Write the empirical formula by combining the elements with their corresponding whole number obtained in step 4. It's important to note that the empirical formula doesn't provide information about the actual molecular structure or total number of atoms in a molecule, but rather the simplest whole number ratio between the elements in the compound."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It is evident that the most logical next event in this scenario is aftercare and proper handling of the freshly pierced septum. After completing the septum piercing, the man would likely provide the individual with guidelines and instructions on how to care for and cleanse the new piercing safely and effectively to minimize any risks of infection, irritation, or other complications. This may include the following: 1. Recommending a saline solution or an over-the-counter wound wash specifically designed for piercings as a cleansing agent. This sterile solution can gently clean the pierced area and facilitate healing. 2. Instructing the individual to clean the piercing two to three times a day. Ensuring the wound is kept clean and free from bacteria is crucial to avoiding infection and promoting a smooth recovery. 3. Advising them to avoid touching the piercing with unwashed hands. Touching the piercing with dirty hands can introduce bacteria and other pathogens which can cause infection. 4. Suggesting they avoid swimming in pools, hot tubs, or other bodies of water for at least 2-3 weeks to prevent exposure to bacteria and potential infection. 5. Reminding them that it is essential to avoid changing the jewelry prematurely. The healing process for a septum piercing typically takes around 6 to 8 weeks, but it can vary for each individual. The person should wait until the piercing is fully healed before changing or removing their jewelry. 6. Informing them of potential signs of infection, such as redness, swelling, excessive pain, or discharge. Should any of these symptoms occur, the individual may be advised to consult a healthcare professional to receive appropriate treatment. 7. Encouraging them to maintain a healthy lifestyle during the healing process - this includes staying well-hydrated, eating nutrient-rich foods, and getting adequate sleep. A healthy immune system can expedite the healing process. Once the man has provided all the necessary instructions and answered any questions or concerns the person may have, he would likely give them a follow-up appointment date to check on the progress of the healing and ensure the piercing does not present any further complications. Overall, the most logical next event after completing the septum piercing is the provision of aftercare guidelines and ensuring the individual is well-informed on how to care for their new piercing to promote a healthy and complication-free healing process."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Allow me to paint you a picture of the enchanting moments that unfolded during my visit... As I walked through the gates, I was immediately embraced by a fairytale-like environment. The Wandering Treant Cafe is not your typical neighborhood cafe; it’s a beguiling celebration of nature.

The staff was eager to cater to my desires, ensuring I was comfortable and well taken care of, striking a beautiful balance between attentiveness and discretion. My waitress Emily effortlessly created a sense of familiarity – as if I was an esteemed guest invited to dine at a friend's home. The enchantment continued with the food – a sumptuous procession of dishes that titillated my taste buds with every morsel. The menu revealed an inspired selection of dishes, paying tribute to local sourcing and earth-to-table inspirations. The Heirloom Tomato Caprese Salad was an exquisite marriage of plump, ripe tomatoes, creamy burrata, fresh basil, and a luscious balsamic reduction. Next, the Carrot-Ginger Soup featured an intoxicating blend of flavors, perfectly balanced in richness and seasoning. The entrée - a Blackened Salmon served over a cauliflower puree and vibrant heirloom vegetables with a delicate lemon-butter sauce, was cooked to perfection with a crisp, blackened skin and tender, flaky meat.

Ever since the Islamist regime came to power in Khartoum, the United States and other Western governments had pressed it to stop providing a haven for terrorist organizations. Other governments in the region, such as those of Egypt, Syria, Jordan, and even Libya, which were targets of some of these groups, added their own pressure. At the same time, the Sudanese regime began to change. Though Turabi had been its inspirational leader, General Omar al Bashir, president since 1989, had never been entirely under his thumb. Thus as outside pressures mounted, Bashir's supporters began to displace those of Turabi. The attempted assassination in Ethiopia of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in June 1995 appears to have been a tipping point. The would-be killers, who came from the Egyptian Islamic Group, had been sheltered in Sudan and helped by  Bin Laden. When the Sudanese refused to hand over three individuals identified as involved in the assassination plot, the UN Security Council passed a resolution criticizing their inaction and eventually sanctioned Khartoum in April 1996. A clear signal to  Bin Laden that his days in Sudan were numbered came when the government advised him that it intended to yield to Libya's demands to stop giving sanctuary to its enemies.  Bin Laden had to tell the Libyans who had been part of his Islamic army that he could no longer protect them and that they had to leave the country. Outraged, several Libyan members of al Qaeda and the Islamic Army Shura renounced all connections with him.  Bin Laden also began to have serious money problems. International pressure on Sudan, together with strains in the world economy, hurt Sudan's currency. Some of  Bin Laden's companies ran short of funds. As Sudanese authorities became less obliging, normal costs of doing business increased. Saudi pressures on the  Bin Laden family also probably took some toll. In any case,  Bin Laden found it necessary both to cut back his spending and to control his outlays more closely.  Question: \\"When did the Sudanese regime begin to change?\\" Answer: \\"After the UN sanctions\\" Based on the paragraph, is this answer correct","output":"No, the answer \\"After the UN sanctions\\" is not correct. The Sudanese regime began to change prior to the UN sanctions. The change started as outside pressures mounted, and General Omar al Bashir's supporters began to displace those of Turabi. The UN Security Council only sanctioned Khartoum in April 1996 after they refused to hand over individuals involved in the assassination plot of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak in June 1995.

Q: Do you think the right answer to the question \\"what do genes contain?\\" is \\"viruses\\", given that  genes contain blueprints? The answer is:","output":"No, the right answer to the question \\"what do genes contain?\\" is not \\"viruses.\\" Genes contain the genetic information, or blueprints, for the development, function, and reproduction of living organisms. This genetic information is composed of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and, in some cases, ribonucleic acid (RNA). The information in DNA is organized into units known as genes, which are segments of DNA that code for specific proteins that perform essential functions in the organism. Although genes do contain blueprints, it is a misconception to equate them with viruses. Viruses are infectious agents that often consist of a protein coat surrounding a nucleic acid core, which may be either DNA or RNA. Viruses replicate by invading the cells of a host organism and utilizing the host's cellular machinery to create new copies of themselves, which can then infect other cells. In some instances, viruses may insert their genetic material into the host's genome, which can lead to the transmission of viral genetic information between generations. However, this does not mean that genes inherently contain viruses; rather, it is a process by which viral genetic material can be incorporated into an organism's DNA. Genes are essential components of an organism's genome, holding the information required for building, maintaining, and ensuring the continuity of life. The genetic information in genes instructs cells on how to create proteins, which are molecules that serve various functions in the growth, development, and maintenance of living organisms. In contrast, viruses are foreign entities that invade cells to reproduce, often causing harm to their hosts in the process. In summary, the right answer to the question \\"what do genes contain?\\" is genetic information in the form of DNA and, occasionally, RNA. While genes do contain blueprints for the development, function, and reproduction of living organisms, this does not equate to them containing viruses. Instead, viruses are infectious agents that may affect an organism's genetic material, potentially incorporating their own genetic information into the host's genome. The distinction between genes and viruses is crucial for understanding the fundamental workings of biology and genetics."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The group reconvened once again to make The W, though without Ol' Dirty Bastard, who was at the time incarcerated in California for violating the terms of his probation. Though incarcerated, ODB managed to make it onto the track \\"Conditioner\\" which featured Snoop Dogg. ODB's vocals were recorded via the telephones used for inmates to talk with visitors, while in prison. The W was mostly well received by critics, particularly for The RZA's production, and also gave the group a hit single with the uptempo \\"Gravel Pit\\", part of a trilogy of videos where the group would visit different eras with a time traveling elevator, which also included \\"Protect Ya Neck (The Jump Off)\\" and \\"Careful (Click, Click)\\", which were then followed by \\"I Can't Go to Sleep\\" featuring Isaac Hayes. The album would go on to reach double platinum status.  Shortly before the release of The W, ODB escaped custody while being transported from a rehab center to a Los Angeles court and was considered a fugitive. At a record release party for The W, ODB appeared with his face hidden by an orange parka, and was not recognized until introduced to the crowd. With police officers present outside, ODB performed briefly and then fled, fearing capture. Six days later ODB caused a commotion, signing autographs in a McDonald's at Broad & Girard Street in North Philadelphia. Unaware of who was causing the commotion, the manager called the police. When the law arrived, ODB mistook them for fans until they drew their guns. ODB fled the facility, but was stopped while trying to start his vehicle. After presenting a fake ID, he admitted his real identity, and was arrested.  In 2001, the Wu-Tang Clan released Iron Flag, an album which made extensive use of outside producers and guests. Its crossover vibe and features, including Ron Isley, Flavor Flav, and prominent producers Trackmasters, marked it as a lighter fare; while critically praised, it gained a less than stellar reputation with fans. Group member Ghostface Killah would later denounce the record.  While originally featured on the cover of Iron Flag, Cappadonna was airbrushed out of the artwork and absent from the album entirely. This may be related to tension that arose within the group when it was revealed that Cappadonna's manager was, or had been, a police informant, a revelation that also brought on the manager's subsequent firing.

And we are all great people and are as good as those wearing red scarves.\\" Bai Yansong, a famous anchor of China Central Television, voiced his support to students wearing green scarves at a primary school in Xi'an by wearing a green tie on a TV program, Oct 19, 2011.                The program focused on a recent controversial issue, triggered by First Experimental Primary School in Northwestern China's Xi'an that made children whose schoolwork and general behavior were not yet good enough to wear green scarves instead of the red scarf of the Chinese Young Pioneers.                \\"The original idea for designing the green scarf was to strengthen education and to encourage the pupils to work harder,\\" said Chen Hong, the school's principal.

Question: What was the Great Migration? Context: Detroit, like many places in the United States, developed racial conflict and discrimination in the 20th century following rapid demographic changes as hundreds of thousands of new workers were attracted to the industrial city; in a short period it became the 4th-largest city in the nation. The Great Migration brought rural blacks from the South; they were outnumbered by southern whites who also migrated to the city. Immigration brought southern and eastern Europeans of Catholic and Jewish faith; these new groups competed with native-born whites for jobs and housing in the booming city. Detroit was one of the major Midwest cities that was a site for the dramatic urban revival of the Ku Klux Klan beginning in 1915. \\"By the 1920s the city had become a stronghold of the KKK,\\" whose members opposed Catholic and Jewish immigrants, as well as black Americans. The Black Legion, a secret vigilante group, was active in the Detroit area in the 1930s, when one-third of its estimated 20,000 to 30,000 members in Michigan were based in the city. It was defeated after numerous prosecutions following the kidnapping and murder in 1936 of Charles Poole, a Catholic Works Progress Administration organizer. A total of 49 men of the Black Legion were convicted of numerous crimes, with many sentenced to life in prison for murder. Answer:","output":"The Great Migration was a mass movement of rural blacks from the South to northern cities, such as Detroit, in the United States during the early to mid-20th century. This migration led to rapid demographic changes and increased competition for jobs and housing, as the African Americans were joined by southern whites, as well as southern and eastern European immigrants of Catholic and Jewish faith.

Q:Information:  - Road tax, known by various names around the world, is a tax which has to be paid on a motor vehicle before using it on a public road.  - Cooks Creek is a community in the Rural Municipality of Springfield . A post office was established there in 1873 on 13 - 12 - 5E and later moved . The community is home to the Immaculate Conception Ukrainian Catholic Church which is an intricately designed structure featuring nine cupolas and built almost entirely with volunteer labour . The church was built in 1923 . There is also another church , called St. Michael 's and Sacred Heart in town which is in the same property as the Cooks Creek Heritage Museum .  - Birds Hill Provincial Park is a provincial park in Manitoba, Canada. It is located 24 kilometres north of Winnipeg on Highway 59, and covers approximately 8300 acres (35.1 square kilometres). The area (and park) is named after Dr. Curtis Bird, first speaker of the Manitoba provincial legislature in 1873, whose father had been a factor in the Hudson's Bay Company and received a large land grant at this location. Since the area is higher than the surrounding terrain, what is now Birds Hill Park served early settlers as a refuge from flooding in the years 1826 and 1852. It is part of the RM of Springfield, with a relatively small portion lying within the Rural Municipality of St. Clements. The provincial park features a mixture of aspen and oak forest with open prairie/savannah, spruce, bog areas and mixed boreal forest communities, not commonly found so close together.  - A town is a human settlement larger than a village but smaller than a city. The size definition for what constitutes a \\"town\\" varies considerably in different parts of the world.  - The R.M. of Springfield was incorporated in 1880 as a result of changes made to the R.M. of Springfield and Sunnyside (1873-1880). The municipality received its name due to the presence of multiple natural springs found within its borders. Springfield stretches from urban industrial development on the eastern boundary of the City of Winnipeg, through urban, rural residential, agricultural and natural landscapes, to the Agassiz Provincial Forest on the municipality's eastern boundary. Birds Hill Provincial Park nestles into the northwestern corner of Springfield. While farming is still important in the municipality, today many residents are employed in nearby Winnipeg. In the 2011 census the population was 14,069, up 8.3% from 2006.  - A community is commonly considered a social unit (a group of people) who have something in common, such as norms, values, or identity. Often - but not always - communities share a sense of place that is situated in a given geographical area (e.g. a country, village, town, or neighborhood). Durable relations that extend beyond immediate genealogical ties also define a sense of community. People tend to define those social ties as important to their identity, practice, and roles in social institutions like family, home, work, government, society, or humanity, at large. Although communities are usually small relative to personal social ties (micro-level), \\"community\\" may also refer to large group affiliations (or macro-level), such as national communities, international communities, and virtual communities.  - A post office is a customer service facility forming part of a national postal system. Post offices offer mail-related services such as acceptance of letters and parcels; provision of post office boxes; and sale of postage stamps, packaging, and stationery.

Stripped off: Cat Lee, 22, dressed in only her bra and pants in protest because the university covered up some of her more erotic artwork. But the student, 22, was so angry with the decision that she stripped to her bra and pants holding a board protesting about the decision. Tutors said they had a duty of. care to the public in case children viewed the material in the gallery. Miss Lee was given the opportunity to restrict entry to her section of the gallery to over 18s only but refused, the university said. The student, who is half way through her. fine arts degree course at the Sussex campus, describes herself as a. painter of erotic scenes. Artwork: In this painting by Cat Lee, called 'The Idea of Love' two people can be seen kissing. Artist: Cat Lee, 22, refused a request to restrict access to her artwork to over 18s. She said she was 'outraged' at not being able to display her work. 'It was embarrassing standing in front of 200 strangers in my smalls but I was outraged by the attitude of the University to my work,' she said. 'I wanted to make a statement that art is sometimes supposed to shock and confront people. It was my first show at the University but I was ordered to withdraw or cover my work with a sheet which was ridiculous. 'In the end I featured less provocative work of a woman's naked torso. But I was fuming.' A university spokesman said that some would find the erotic artwork inappropriate. 'The university has a duty care of to the public and this art work was deemed to be sexually graphic and abusive in nature,' he said. 'We had to consider that children could be attending the exhibition and that this work might be inappropriate. 'The student was given the option to display her work in a separate space with appropriate warnings, but she rejected this option. 'Another option was to restrict entry to the gallery to over 18s only, but other exhibiting students felt that this restricted their audience. However, the student did display a less explicit piece of work.' Miss Lee now plans a week long exhibition in July at the Mowlem Street art studios in East London where she has been promised her more explicit work will not be kept under wraps. 'I expect to keep my clothes on for that one. I was appalled at the University for claiming to be a centre for contemporary art and then banning most of my stuff,' she added. 'I know my work is provocative but it is supposed to be. Visitors should decide for themselves how erotic art should be. 'This is the age of Fifty Shades of Grey.

With the exception of 'Combo', I thought the acting was poor and the narrative was limited. It came across like a 'made for TV' drama. I felt that the film was very contrived. The whole set up of hammering in the context at the start (yes, we get that this is 80s Britain - you can stop now) was tiresome, and gave a very one-sided view of what life was like in 80s Britain - poverty, war juxtaposed with royalty, Margaret Thatcher, yet nothing in between? There were actually middle-classes who existed back then - just ordinary working people, with a decent wage and a mortgage. The Falklands clips also seemed to be added randomly towards the end, for 'dramatic effect', I presume. The sequence of events felt a tad disjointed, as the characters moved one one action to the next without us seeing how their mindset could've changed so quickly. The relationship between 'Shaun' and 'Smell' was toe-curling. I couldn't even look during the snogging scene. I find it very hard to believe that she would've been attracted to a boy who was not only so much younger, but also looked so much younger. I know there were only four years between them, but four years is nothing once you reach your twenties, yet it's a huge difference in your teens! In my experience, that kind of teen age difference only occurs when the girl is the younger one, since girls mature so much quicker, and are more on the wavelength of boys a few years older. Sorry, but I didn't buy it - an unnecessary plot point created for shock value. The ending was somewhat abrupt and, again, contrived. If the flag throwing incident was supposed to be iconic, then it fell somewhat short in my eyes. It bugs me that British films only concern themselves with either the upper classes or the poverty-stricken. Don't get me wrong, I love Trainspotting, and Four Weddings has its charms, but can't we Brits come up with anything different? Why are our films always so hung up on the class system? I was born in 1973, so wasn't much different in age to 'Shaun' would've been in 1983. I grew up in a single parent family on a fairly down-trodden council estate in a city in England. However, my childhood experiences were vastly different to those portrayed in the film - I don't even remember racism being an issue (although i'm not saying it didn't exist). 'This is England'? Not in my experience. The bottom line is that I felt this film lacked substance, and I was completely bored and unimpressed throughout.

Effusive opinions flowed from all directions: some saw the acquisition as a sensible fit for Microsoft to better support developers, and some saw it as a tyrant getting their grubby fingers on open source’s ecosystem. I am thrilled for Microsoft and GitHub for many reasons, and there will be a bright future ahead because of it, but I have been thinking more about the reaction some of the critics have had to this, and why. I find it fascinating that there still seems to be a deep-seated discomfort in some about Microsoft and their involvement in open source. I understand that this is for historical reasons, and many moons ago Microsoft were definitely on the offensive against open source. I too was critical of Microsoft and their approach back in those days. I may have even said ‘M’ instead of ‘MS’ (ugh.) Things have changed though. Satya Nadella, their CEO, has had a profound impact on the company: they are a significant investor and participant in open source across a multitude of open source projects, they hire many open source developers, run their own open source projects (e.g. VSCode), and actively sponsor and support many open source conferences, events, and initiatives. I know many people who work at Microsoft and they love the company and their work there. These are not microserfs: they are people like you and me. Things have changed, and I have literally never drunk Kool-aid; this or any other type. Are they perfect? No, but they don’t claim to be. But is the Microsoft of today a radically different company to the Microsoft of the late nineties. No doubt. Still though, this cynicism exists in some. Some see them as a trojan horse and ask if we can really trust them? A little while ago I had a discussion with someone who was grumbling about Microsoft.

Review: satisfyingly scarifying ,  Is this movie review sentence negative or positive?","output":"The movie review sentence, \\"satisfyingly scarifying\\" can be considered both positive and negative based on the specific context, and it depends on the preferences of the individual interpreting it. On the positive side, the term \\"satisfyingly\\" implies that the movie was able to fulfill or meet the expectations of the person who watched it. This could mean that the movie was enjoyable, met its intended goals, or provided a gratifying experience for the viewer. Interpretations of the term \\"satisfyingly\\" can vary, but in the context of a movie review, it usually denotes a sense of contentment or a positive experience. On the negative side, the term \\"scarifying\\" is generally associated with creating feelings of fear, horror, or emotional distress. It could mean that the movie contains frightening visuals, intense emotional scenes, or a suspenseful atmosphere. Its use in the movie review implies that the film produced a strong emotional reaction in the viewer. Now, depending on the individual's taste, they may see experiencing fear or suspense as a positive or negative aspect of a movie. In conclusion, the combination of these two terms creates a complex emotional response to the film. The movie is described as being both satisfying (positive) and scarifying (potentially negative, depending on taste). For fans of the horror or thriller genre, this could be seen as a positive review as it indicates that the movie provides the desired feelings of fear, suspense, or emotional intensity. For viewers not keen on such feelings, the review may convey a more negative image, as it suggests that the movie can be distressing or significantly emotionally intense."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Does dress mean the same thing in these two sentences?","output":"No, the word \\"dress\\" does not mean the same thing in these two sentences.  In Sentence 1: \\"Dress the patient\\", the term \\"dress\\" is used to describe the physical act of putting clothes on someone or something, in this specific context the someone is the patient. This scenario might commonly be seen in a hospital setting or at home with elderly or disabled care wherein patients are incapable of putting on their clothes by themselves due to their health condition. Hence, they require help from healthcare professionals or caregivers to put on their clothes, also known as dressing the patient. This use of the term 'dress' comes under the more literal usage of the word. In Sentence 2: \\"Dress the plants in the garden\\", the word \\"dress\\" is used in a different context meaning to prepare the plants or soil for planting or growth. Here, dressing usually involves adding nutrients to the soil which can be in the form of fertilizer, compost, or manure to enrich the soil thereby stimulating plant growth. This type of dressing helps to improve the soil's condition making it more conducive for plants to thrive. Therefore, this is a specific term used in gardening or agriculture context. So, despite having the same word 'dress', the meaning significantly differs based on the context and subjects involved. This scenario demonstrates the flexibility of English language usage over a wide range of fields. In sum, it's important to understand the context in which certain words are being used because their meaning can dramatically fluctuate depending on various situations."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

He is on a government wanted list. Opposition activists said officers went to the hospital in Kiev to arrest him. The police said they had opened an inquiry into his abduction and were trying to question him about that. One interior ministry official said there were suspicions the abduction was faked as part of an attempt at provoking unrest. Local reports later said the officers had left without questioning Mr Bulatov, but some police guards had been posted at the hospital. Protests broke out in November, when President Viktor Yanukovych pulled out of a deal with the EU in favour of a Russian bailout. In mid-January, police and demonstrators clashed after the government passed a law severely restricting protesters' rights. Mr Yanukovych has since ordered the law repealed, signed an amnesty for protesters and accepted the resignation of his cabinet. Mr Bulatov, who was found bloodied and bedraggled on the outskirts of the capital on Thursday, said he had been left to die by his captors. \\"They crucified me, so there are holes in my hands now,\\" he said. \\"They cut off my ear, cut up my face. My whole body is a mess. You can see everything. I am alive. Thank God for this.\\" The activist reportedly said he did not know who had abducted him, but his abductors had spoken with Russian accents. Opposition leader Vitali Klitschko, who was at the hospital, said about 15 officers had turned up with a court order to serve on Mr Bulatov that would allow him to be taken into custody. He labelled the episode \\"absurd\\" and said the investigators would not let him see the orders. Arseniy Yatsenyuk, the leader of another opposition party who earlier refused an offer to become prime minister, said protesters now faced \\"murders, abuse, torture [and] kidnappings\\" \\"Recent events with Dmytro Bulatov are evidence of the fact that there are now death squads in Ukraine, like in Latin America,\\" he said. Amnesty International described Mr Bulatov's ordeal as a \\"barbaric act which must be investigated immediately\\". The BBC's Duncan Crawford in Kiev says Mr Bulatov is the latest of a number of activists to have gone missing. At least one was later found dead. Denys Kazansky, opposition activist: \\"The people who ordered this nightmarish act of barbarity can no longer be called a legitimate government...

The statement said the military had labelled as \\"unacceptable\\" the occupation of government buildings by protesters. Soldiers have not yet been deployed against the protesters during the crisis. Nato chief Anders Fogh Rasmussen said in a tweet: \\"Ukraine's military is highly respected and must remain neutral.

How many ways can he place the shells, if reflections and rotations of an arrangement are considered equivalent?","output":"To solve this problem, we follow these steps: 1. **Count the total arrangements without considering symmetries**: Since there are 10 different sea shells and 10 positions where they can be placed, the total number of ways to arrange these shells without considering any symmetries is the number of permutations of 10 items, which is 10!. 2. **Identify the symmetries in the problem**: The symmetries in this problem include rotations and reflections. Specifically, the star can be rotated by 0, 1/5, 2/5, 3/5, or 4/5 of a full rotation, and it can be reflected or not reflected. This means each unique arrangement can appear in 10 different forms (5 rotations times 2 for reflection or no reflection). 3. **Correct for the symmetries**: To find the number of distinct arrangements (where rotations and reflections are considered equivalent), we divide the total number of arrangements by the number of ways each arrangement can appear due to symmetries. This gives us 10! / 10. Putting it all together, we calculate the number of distinct arrangements as follows:  frac{10!}{10} = frac{3628800}{10} = 362880  Therefore, the number of distinct arrangements of the sea shells, considering rotations and reflections as equivalent, is boxed{362880}."},{"instruction":"A shopkeeper sells 200 metres of cloth for Rs. 12,000.

The cost price for one metre of cloth is Rs. 66, so the total cost price for 200 metres is: Total Cost Price = Cost Price per Metre × Quantity Total Cost Price = Rs. 66 × 200 Total Cost Price = Rs. 13,200 The selling price for 200 metres of cloth is Rs. 12,000. Now, we can calculate the total loss by subtracting the selling price from the total cost price: Total Loss = Total Cost Price - Selling Price Total Loss = Rs. 13,200 - Rs. 12,000 Total Loss = Rs. 1,200 To find the loss per metre of cloth, we divide the total loss by the quantity of cloth sold: Loss per Metre = Total Loss / Quantity Loss per Metre = Rs. 1,200 / 200 Loss per Metre = Rs. 6 Therefore, the loss per metre of cloth is Rs. boxed{6} ."},{"instruction":"f some number raised to the power of (2x + 2) equals 16 ^ (3x  1), and the value of x is 1, what is the base of the first exponent?","output":"Let's denote the base of the first exponent as \\"a\\".

Consider ( triangle ABC ) with ( AB = AC ) and points ( P ) and ( Q ) such that ( AP = BQ ), and ( P ) and ( Q ) lie on the extensions of ( CA ) and ( AB ) respectively. # Step-by-Step Solution: 1. **Draw the Configuration:**    Draw ( triangle ABC ) with ( AB = AC ). Extend ( CA ) to ( P ) such that ( AP ) is a given length, and also extend ( AB ) to ( Q ) such that ( BQ ) equals the same length ( AP ). 2. **Connect the Circumcenter ( O ) to Vertices and Points ( P ) and ( Q ):**    We connect the circumcenter ( O ) of ( triangle ABC ) to the vertices ( A ), ( B ), and ( C ), and to the points ( P ) and ( Q ).    - ( O ) is equidistant from ( A ), ( B ), and ( C ), so ( OA = OB = OC ). 3. **Examine ( triangle OCP ) and ( triangle OAQ ):**    In ( triangle OCP ) and ( triangle OAQ ):    - ( OA = OC ) (as ( O ) is the circumcenter).    - By construction, ( AP = BQ ). 4. **Equality of Angles:**    - Since ( AB = AC ) and ( O ) is the circumcenter, ( angle OAC = angle OCA ).    - In isosceles ( triangle APC ) and ( triangle BQC ), ( angle CPO = angle AQO ) because ( CP = AQ ) and both contain the equal radius lengths. 5. **Angle Relationships:**    - Since ( O ) is on the angle bisector of ( angle AOB ), it follows that ( angle OBA = angle OAB ). 6. **Congruence ( triangle OCP cong triangle OAQ ):**    - From the equality of the sides and included angles, we can state that ( triangle OCP cong triangle OAQ ). 7. **Circumcenter Property:**    - This implies that ( angle CPO = angle AQO ). 8. **Cyclic Quadrilateral:**    - Since ( angle CPO = angle AQO ), ( O, A, P, Q ) must lie on the same circle by the Inscribed Angle Theorem.

The ball rolls without slipping around the track and leaves (velocity  v ) traveling horizontally in the opposite direction. Afterwards, it bounces on the floor. How far (horizontally) from the end of the track will the ball bounce for the second time? The ball’s surface has a theoretically infinite coefficient of static friction. It is a perfect sphere of uniform density. All collisions with the ground are perfectly elastic and theoretically instantaneous. Variations could involve the initial velocity being given before the ball enters the track or state that the normal force between the ball and the track right before leaving is zero (centripetal acceleration).  *Problem proposed by Brian Yue*","output":"To solve this problem, we need to analyze the motion of the ball as it rolls around the half circular track, leaves the track, and bounces on the floor. We will use principles of mechanics, including conservation of energy, kinematics, and dynamics of rolling motion. 1. **Determine the velocity of the ball as it leaves the track:**    - The ball rolls without slipping around the half circular track of radius ( R ). As it leaves the track, it has a horizontal velocity ( v ).    - Since the ball rolls without slipping, the point of contact with the track has zero velocity relative to the track. The velocity of the center of mass ( v ) is related to the angular velocity ( omega ) by ( v = R omega ). 2. **Analyze the collision with the ground:**    - The ball hits the ground with the point of contact moving at a velocity ( 2v ) with respect to the ground. This is because the ball's center of mass has velocity ( v ) and the point of contact has an additional velocity ( v ) due to rolling.    - After hitting the ground, the ball exerts a force ( F ) on the ground, and the ground exerts an equal and opposite force on the ball. This force changes both the translational and rotational motion of the ball. 3. **Calculate the change in translational and rotational motion:**    - The change in translational velocity ( Delta v ) is given by ( Delta v = -frac{Ft}{M} ), where ( M ) is the mass of the ball and ( t ) is the duration of the collision.    - The torque ( tau ) exerted on the ball is ( tau = FR ), which changes the angular velocity ( Delta omega ) by ( Delta omega = frac{tau t}{I} = frac{FRt}{I} ), where ( I ) is the moment of inertia of the ball. For a sphere, ( I = frac{2}{5}MR^2 ). 4. **Relate the change in angular velocity to the change in translational velocity:**    - The change in angular velocity ( Delta omega ) corresponds to a change in the translational velocity of the surface of the ball relative to the center of the ball by ( Delta v_{text{surface}} = R Delta omega = frac{5Ft}{2M} ).    - The total change in the velocity of the surface of the ball relative to the ground is ( Delta v_{text{total}} = Delta v + Delta v_{text{surface}} = -frac{Ft}{M} + frac{5Ft}{2M} = frac{3Ft}{2M} ). 5. **Determine the force and time of collision:**    - Since the velocity of the surface of the ball relative to the ground must be ( -2v ), we have ( frac{3Ft}{2M} = -2v ). Solving for ( Ft ), we get ( Ft = frac{4Mv}{3} ). 6. **Calculate the final horizontal velocity of the ball:**    - The change in the translational velocity of the ball after the impact is ( Delta v = -frac{Ft}{M} = -frac{4v}{3} ).    - The final horizontal velocity of the ball is ( v_{text{final}} = v + Delta v = v - frac{4v}{3} = -frac{v}{3} ). 7. **Determine the horizontal distance for the second bounce:**    - The ball bounces with a horizontal velocity of ( -frac{v}{3} ). The time ( t ) it takes for the ball to hit the ground again can be found using the vertical motion. The ball falls a distance ( 2R ) (the diameter of the track) under gravity.    - Using the kinematic equation ( y = frac{1}{2}gt^2 ), we get ( 2R = frac{1}{2}gt^2 ), so ( t = sqrt{frac{4R}{g}} ).    - The horizontal distance ( d ) traveled in this time is ( d = v_{text{final}} cdot t = -frac{v}{3} cdot sqrt{frac{4R}{g}} = -frac{2v}{3} sqrt{frac{R}{g}} ). 8. **Calculate the total horizontal distance for the second bounce:**    - The ball travels a distance ( 2R ) horizontally while in the track, and an additional distance ( -frac{2v}{3} sqrt{frac{R}{g}} ) after the first bounce.    - The total horizontal distance is ( 2R + left(-frac{2v}{3} sqrt{frac{R}{g}}right) ). The final answer is ( boxed{ 2R - frac{2v}{3} sqrt{frac{R}{g}} } )."},{"instruction":"The line joining the midpoints of the diagonals of a trapezoid has length 5.

It is a crucial component of the country's infrastructure and plays a vital role in supporting economic development and daily life. The industry encompasses various entities, including investor-owned utility companies, cooperatives, municipal utilities, and government-owned utilities. These organizations generate, transmit, and distribute electricity, either through conventional power plants or renewable energy sources like wind, solar, and hydroelectricity. In addition to electricity, the utility industry also deals with the extraction, transportation, and distribution of natural gas, ensuring its availability for residential, commercial, and industrial customers. Water utilities, on the other hand, manage the collection, purification, and distribution of safe drinking water, while wastewater treatment utilities handle the collection and treatment of wastewater for environmental protection. Regulation of the utility industry varies by state, as some states have deregulated markets where consumers can choose their energy supplier, while others maintain a regulated monopoly model. State public utility commissions generally oversee the industry, ensuring fair rates, reliable service, and environmental compliance. The utility industry in the USA is continuously evolving to embrace emerging technologies, address environmental concerns, and transition toward a more sustainable and resilient energy infrastructure. This includes integrating smart grid technologies, promoting energy efficiency and conservation, and integrating more renewable energy sources into the grid."},{"instruction":"What is the summary of each character Demon Girls personalities, dynamics, and appearances in Helltaker, but Lucifer: Lucifer in Helltaker is a well-endowed and refined woman, with white long hair, red eyes, and distinctive large white horns.

So I was pleased with myself. My classmates and I delighted in highly dynamic social lives. We would paint, play cards, and have diversions. Go dancing, and so on... There were a few boys in our class. The ones we knew would always stay in the same group and wouldn't mix with us socially. We would do arts and crafts and make little paintings and sculptures. The only problem was that there was no watercolour paint. So there would be no outside painting, but this was the least of our worries. I had received a small art set as a gift from my grandparents, but I didn't have any sense of artistic inclination. As I recall that moment, I can still feel the warmth of the sun on my skin and the gentle breeze that carried the scent of blooming flowers. He stood before me, tall and confident, with piercing blue eyes that seemed to look right through me. His voice was deep and soothing, like a melody that I couldn't get enough of. As we talked, I couldn't help but notice the way his hands moved gracefully as he spoke, emphasizing his words with subtle gestures. The way he leaned in slightly, as if sharing a secret, made me feel like I was the only person in the world who mattered to him at that moment. When he gave me the books, I remember the feel of the smooth covers under my fingertips, the sound of the pages rustling as I turned them, and the smell of the ink and paper. As I read, I was transported to different worlds and times, each one more fascinating than the last. The words on the page seemed to come alive, and I could almost hear the voices of the philosophers and thinkers he had introduced me to. He brought books on Surrealism, Protopopov, Bukharin, Tzvetan Todorov, Agamemnon, Sartre, Derrida, Kierkegaard, Poincare, Nietzsche, and Marx. Looking back, I realize that it wasn’t just his knowledge that made him so amazing, but the way he shared it with me. He made me feel like I was capable of understanding these complex ideas, and that I had something valuable to contribute to the conversation. It was a feeling that stayed with me long after our conversation ended, and one that I will always cherish. ‘To me, he was an inspirational figure, someone of action, someone of spirit, and someone I wanted to emulate. –She breathed shallowly- Some of the most forceful speeches I’d ever heard came from his mouth. He was magnificent. That’s how I remember him. A friend of mine, a French woman, remembers having a conversation with him. While, the three of us sat in a café on a trip through Paris. She recollects him, asking, 'Why are all great men-people like the Marquis de Sade? Represented as monstrous to be historically interesting?' (She herself is an artist.) 'He’d said categorically that there are no monsters or individuals who have made a botch. What I recall from that moment speaks to a significant sense of justice. It wasn't a vision. It wasn’t progressive, but it had all the makings of humanism. For a minute, he gave me trust. There were more than those they had educated me about.' ‘He was approximately my father's age, tall but slightly shorter than him, six feet seven.' I looked into his eyes and thought: There was something there. But could never figure out what that was. ‘He’s just like my father and thinks I’m beautiful.’ ‘In what sense?\\" Asked Jon ‘In the sense that there was an inner strength. Silences and quiet times mean as much as words. When words were necessary, none between us were-wasted, and I liked that about him.’ ‘Go on,’ Jon said. \\"He said nothing, but the silence was palpable. I could feel my heart racing as I searched for a response, but my mind was blank. The room felt suffocatingly quiet, and I could hear the sound of my own breathing. I shifted my weight from one foot to the other, feeling the coolness of the floor through the soles of my shoes. My cheeks were burning, and I couldn't help but look down at my feet, hoping to disappear into the ground. His gentle touch on my shoulder brought me back to the present moment. He could sense my embarrassment and self-consciousness, and he knew just what to do. With his guidance, I learned how to embrace my true self and let go of my insecurities.\\" 'Naturally, given your experience. ‘Thank you,’ Cristina replied. Jon merely smiled. While Jon and Cristina were talking. Jon’s father, Jake, sat on the hall floor, out of sight, listening to their conversation in shock. ‘We went out to lunch, then we went dancing, and I was having a wonderful time.’ ‘When we went to our first club, we had a great time.' We were so young, danced and laughed. Were a little out of place, but we were having so much fun. I was so content, I didn’t care.' Then he said we could go home together. But I couldn’t think of what to say. Cristina said. Jon looked at her and was about to ask about his father, Jake, and what he made of it all during this time. Before Jon could ask, Jake walked into the kitchen. ‘I was wondering where you two were,’ he said. Jake looked at Cristina, then at Jon. 'What's going on?' Jake asked. With a serious look on his face. ‘Mom was telling me about Michael,’ Jon said. Jake had hoped never to hear that name again. Cristina had broken a promise made long ago not to bring his name up again. ‘Your mother was talking about Michael,’ Jake said. Cristina's face dropped. 'I was married to an older man, and then I met your father; when I married him,' 'I betrayed the man I was married to.' Jake couldn’t believe what Cristina had said. ‘What happened to Michael?’ Jake asked. ‘He was my redeemer.’ 'Cristina, I don’t believe you.' Jake said. ‘When I was young, I’d done many things wrong, things I regret doing now, but they were long ago and no longer matter. Things that surfaced when I met him, caused me immense pain. With love, patience, and guidance, he supported me to soothe the pain I had inside.’ ‘I don't understand.' Is Michael your husband?' Cristina nodded. ‘My father was so desolate.’ ‘I was seeing Michael.’ ‘You know what I mean.' Cristina said. Jake had never seen Cristina cry; he was trying to understand. ‘Cristina, look at me,’ Jake said. Cristina looked the other way as Jake walked around and lifted her head. 'Was Michael your husband?' Jake said. ‘Yes’ Cristina said. 'When we were married, I was married to Michael. I loved him. I couldn't stop thinking about him,' Jake railed in shock; his entire world (or so it seemed) built on a lie. Jake went from the kitchen; he slid down the hall wall, ended up on the floor, and sobbed violently.","output":"I was confident in my knowledge and wouldn't have accepted that things weren't easily solved, so I was pleased with myself. My classmates and I had highly dynamic social lives. We would paint, play cards, and have various diversions. We would go dancing and do other activities... In our class, there were a few boys who always stayed in the same group and didn't mix with us socially. We would engage in arts and crafts and create small paintings and sculptures. The only problem was that we didn't have any watercolor paint, so we couldn't paint outside. However, this was the least of our worries. I had received a small art set as a gift from my grandparents, but I didn't have any artistic inclination. As I recall that moment, I can still feel the warmth of the sun on my skin and the gentle breeze carrying the scent of blooming flowers. He stood before me, tall and confident, with piercing blue eyes that seemed to see right through me. His voice was deep and soothing, like a melody that I couldn't get enough of. As we talked, I couldn't help but notice the graceful movement of his hands as he spoke, using subtle gestures to emphasize his words. He leaned in slightly, as if sharing a secret, making me feel like I was the most important person in the world to him at that moment. When he gave me the books, I remember feeling the smooth covers under my fingertips, hearing the sound of the pages rustling as I turned them, and smelling the ink and paper. As I read, I was transported to different worlds and times, each one more fascinating than the last. The words on the page seemed to come alive, and I could almost hear the voices of the philosophers and thinkers he had introduced me to. He brought books on Surrealism, Protopopov, Bukharin, Tzvetan Todorov, Agamemnon, Sartre, Derrida, Kierkegaard, Poincare, Nietzsche, and Marx. Looking back, I realize that it wasn't just his knowledge that made him amazing, but the way he shared it with me. He made me feel like I could understand these complex ideas and that I had something valuable to contribute to the conversation. It was a feeling that stayed with me long after our conversation ended, and one that I will always cherish. \\"To me, he was an inspirational figure, someone of action, someone of spirit, and someone I wanted to emulate,\\" she breathed shallowly. \\"Some of the most forceful speeches I had ever heard came from his mouth. He was magnificent. That's how I remember him.\\" A friend of mine, a French woman, remembers having a conversation with him while the three of us sat in a café during a trip through Paris. She recollects him asking, \\"Why are all great men-people like the Marquis de Sade represented as monstrous to be historically interesting?\\" She herself is an artist. \\"He categorically stated that there are no monsters or individuals who have made a botch,\\" she said. \\"What I recall from that moment speaks to a significant sense of justice. It wasn't visionary or progressive, but it had all the makings of humanism. For a minute, he gave me trust. There were more than those they had educated me about. He was approximately my father's age, tall but slightly shorter than him, six feet seven.\\" I looked into his eyes and thought, \\"There was something there,\\" but I could never figure out what it was. \\"He's just like my father and thinks I'm beautiful.\\" \\"In what sense?\\" asked Jon. \\"In the sense that there was an inner strength. Silences and quiet times meant as much as words. When words were necessary, none between us were wasted, and I liked that about him.\\" \\"Go on,\\" Jon said. \\"He said nothing, but the silence was palpable. I could feel my heart racing as I searched for a response, but my mind was blank. The room felt suffocatingly quiet, and I could hear the sound of my own breathing. I shifted my weight from one foot to the other, feeling the coolness of the floor through the soles of my shoes. My cheeks were burning, and I couldn't help but look down at my feet, hoping to disappear into the ground. His gentle touch on my shoulder brought me back to the present moment. He could sense my embarrassment and self-consciousness, and he knew just what to do. With his guidance, I learned how to embrace my true self and let go of my insecurities.\\" \\"Naturally, given your experience.\\" \\"Thank you,\\" Cristina replied. Jon merely smiled. While Jon and Cristina were talking, Jon's father, Jake, sat on the hall floor, out of sight, listening to their conversation in shock. \\"We went out to lunch, then we went dancing, and I was having a wonderful time.\\" \\"When we went to our first club, we had a great time. We were so young, danced and laughed. We were a little out of place, but we were having so much fun. I was so content, I didn't care.\\" \\"Then he said we could go home together, but I couldn't think of what to say,\\" Cristina said. Jon looked at her and was about to ask about his father, Jake, and what he made of it all during this time. Before Jon could ask, Jake walked into the kitchen. \\"I was wondering where you two were,\\" he said. Jake looked at Cristina, then at Jon. \\"What's going on?\\" Jake asked, his face serious. \\"Mom was telling me about Michael,\\" Jon said. Jake had hoped never to hear that name again. Cristina had broken a promise made long ago not to bring his name up again. \\"Your mother was talking about Michael,\\" Jake said. Cristina's face dropped. \\"I was married to an older man, and then I met your father when I married him.\\" \\"I betrayed the man I was married to,\\" Jake couldn't believe what Cristina had said. \\"What happened to Michael?\\" Jake asked. \\"He was my redeemer.\\" \\"Cristina, I don't believe you,\\" Jake said. \\"When I was young, I did many things wrong, things I regret now, but they were long ago and no longer matter. Things that resurfaced when I met him caused me immense pain. With love, patience, and guidance, he supported me to soothe the pain I had inside.\\" \\"I don't understand. Is Michael your husband?\\" Cristina nodded. \\"My father was so heartbroken.\\" \\"I was seeing Michael.\\" \\"You know what I mean,\\" Cristina said. Jake had never seen Cristina cry, and he was trying to understand. \\"Cristina, look at me,\\" Jake said. Cristina looked the other way as Jake walked around and lifted her head. \\"Was Michael your husband?\\" Jake said. \\"Yes,\\" Cristina said. \\"When we were married, I was married to Michael.

By some twist of fate, they make a wish that swaps their bodies for a day, unknowingly setting the stage for a chain of comical and heartwarming events. With no other choice but to work together, they embark on an unforgettable journey to understand each other's lives and maybe even discover a hidden bond that goes beyond their initial animosity. Act 1: The Switch Chitoge and Raku wake up to find that they have swapped bodies, initially in disbelief. They realize it's Freaky Friday-style— a chance to experience life from the other's perspective. Their minds race as they try to navigate their new lives, trying to hide their true identities from everyone around them. Chitoge finds herself struggling with academic expectations while Raku struggles with Chitoge's athletic prowess. Act 2: Walk in Each Other's Shoes Chitoge, now in Raku's body, discovers the difficulties he faces with his father's gang affiliation and worrying about the safety of his friends. Meanwhile, Raku, experiencing life as Chitoge, understands her constant battle with expectations as the daughter of a wealthy family. As they tackle new challenges, they develop a deeper empathy for one another's struggles. Act 3: Unexpected Connections and Revelations During their day in each other's bodies, Chitoge and Raku start to uncover hidden aspects that make them more alike than they thought. In Raku's body, Chitoge volunteers at the gang's hangout spot, empathizing with Raku's tough choices. Raku, in Chitoge's body, attends a high-class event, where he realizes the pressure Chitoge faces to fit her family's image. Through various interactions, they slowly let go of their previous misconceptions and connect on a more personal level. Act 4: A Wistful Goodbye As the day comes to an end, both Chitoge and Raku have to confront their feelings for one another. They meet at sunset, back at the place they made their wish, and share their newfound understanding, vulnerability, and mutual respect. They realize that their arguments had been fueled by misunderstandings and that deep down, they care for one another. Conclusion: Returning to their original bodies, Chitoge and Raku find their relationship transformed. They're now more considerate and empathetic toward each other, having walked a mile in each other's shoes. While their daily bickering continues, it's now laced with affection and a deeper understanding. Their Freaky Friday-style adventure taught them the value of seeing beyond the surface and built a foundation for a stronger friendship or even something more."},{"instruction":"Cheek and adjust the following for readability and flow, the cheek and adjust for tense agreement, please keep the formatting of the original:Cristina grasped what she'd done and went to get up, but Jon prevented her. Saying, ‘You stay right here. I'm seeing if dad's okay; once it’s done, I'm getting Emily from upstairs, and we're going tonight!' Jon said. He was both shocked and seething at once. Jon went into the hall and stopped by his devastated dad. ‘Strange question to ask, but are you all right, dad?’ Jon asked Jake. Jake was too numb at that moment to express how he felt in words. Jon stayed with him and made sure he was okay. Jake got up and went upstairs, where he retrieved an old leather suitcase from the top of the wardrobe. Cristina came in and saw what he was doing. ‘It’s very late; where would you go?' Cristina said. In a near panic. Jake gave Cristina an expression that said, ‘Don’t.’ He finished packing and went down to his car. Emily came downstairs after being sent up for her own safety.. ‘What’s happening?’ she inquired. ‘Complicated. Come to me.’ said Jon. Putting the suitcase in the car, Jake got in. At that moment, Jon came out. ‘Dad, where are you going?’ he said. Rolling down the window, Jake looked at Jon and said, 'I have to go, okay?' I do not know where and for how long; now it would be better if you and Emily went home. Now, no part of this is your fault, but it would be better if you weren't home for a while!' Jon looked at his father, confused. He's not usually one for tears. They spread all over Jon's face. Emily goes to the door and sees how Jon is. 'Hey, I've got you,\\" she said tactfully. As the night drew to a close, the house exuded a sense of stillness. Yet an inexplicable feeling of unease lingered in the air. Jon opened his eyes, and he was back in the present. Emily was there. ‘Been away again?' 'When were you?' She inquired. Jon looked at her and said, 'It was that night in 1986. Dad had packed a bag and told me it would be best if I didn’t come home for a bit, and you came out and discovered me crying!' Emily looked elsewhere in remembrance for a moment and said, ‘I’m surprised you recall that. Most people suppress things like that. It’s how trauma is dealt with by many people.' The day wore on, and the sun began setting. ‘Everything’s ready for the airport.' Emily Said. ‘Sorry,’ Jon said (a little distracted). ‘I said everything was ready for the airport,’ Emily said again. ‘That’s fine. 'I have a few minor things to pack, but that won’t be till tomorrow,’ Jon said. At that moment, the phone began ringing, and Jon raced down the stairs. ‘Hello’ 'Jon its Dad' ‘Hi, how are things?’ ‘Emily and I are on the Redeye tomorrow and should be with you and Mom at 10 a.m. tomorrow.’ ‘Regarding that matter, Jon, that plan is not workable.’ ‘Mom is currently back in Bright Valley. Receiving medical care and recovering well. However, she is not permitted to have any visitors.’ ‘I see that presents a difficult situation. As previously mentioned. Emily and I have made reservations for the early Redeye flight tomorrow. Unfortunately, it cannot be-cancelled or changed.’ Jake (Jon’s father) whistles in response. ‘I understand completely, Jon. Therefore, it is only natural for you and Emily to join me. I have some inkling about the reason for your visit.’ ‘Indeed, it seems like the time to tackle that matter.’ ‘How’s Anna?’ 'Your sister, the last I heard from her, and that was six months ago, had entered a writers' colony. Embarked on a relationship with a young woman called Calypso.' 'She appears happier, more settled, I would say.' ‘That’s great,’ Jon said. ‘Anyway, Jon, I’ve got to go,’ Jake said. With that, the call ended. Emily was sitting on one stair and looking at Jon. ‘Are we still going?’ she said. Jon walked over, took Emilie’s face in his hands, and kissed her on the forehead. ‘Yes, we are, but Mom won’t be there.’ Emily cocked her head to one side. ‘Oh,’ ‘She’s in Bright Valley again,’ Jon said. ‘I’m not quite certain I comprehend what that is,’ Emily said. ‘Sorry, yes, Bright-Valley is a specialist care facility. For people with complex mental health needs. Tt’s not like a state hospital with barred windows and keypads on the doors; it’s by a lake and very peaceful.’ Jon Said. ‘You mean she never recovered from that night?’ Emily said. Jon looked down at the floor. Trying to gather the collection of scattered thoughts racing through his mind. ‘No, not fully; dad didn’t either, I mean, not really; he went to see Michael. He went to meet Michael which was quite a task. Because of the difficulty in locating him.’ upon coming face to face with the individual. ‘Dad was prepared to physically confront them. Yet upon seeing them in a state of mobility impairment, refrained from doing so. Because of a falling piece of rebar from a new office tower under construction. It hit Michael in the back and now cannot walk. ‘ Emily looked at Jon and cringed; she detested the things he said. 'Sorry, old girl, almost done.' Emily buried her head in her folded arms and nodded for Jon to continue. Jon rubbed Emily’s shoulder, trying to provide what comfort he could. 'Dad confronted Michael about mom. He explained that the divorce decree had only come through two months after Mom and Dad had been married. That he hadn’t seen Mom in years.' ‘How did your dad take it? I mean, hearing what Michael had to say,’ Emily said. Jon ran his hands down his face and sighed. Jon held back his emotions, refusing to let them spill out. He had always been tight-lipped about the incident, never divulging any details or speaking at length about it. As they talked, Jon's limited knowledge of the matter became apparent, and it was clear that they had a conversation that left him feeling uneasy. The discomfort was palpable, and the tension in the air was thick. Despite the situation having been resolved, there was no chance of them becoming friends. \\"Regrettably, my knowledge concludes there,\\" Jon expressed, his voice heavy with regret. The silence that followed was deafening, and Jon couldn't help but feel a pang of sadness. He wished he could express himself more freely, but the words just wouldn't come. He longed to describe the way his heart raced and his palms grew sweaty during the conversation, the way his stomach churned with anxiety. He wanted to convey the way the room felt, the way the air seemed to thicken with every passing moment. But he couldn't find the words, and so he remained silent. The memory of that conversation would stay with him forever, a constant reminder of the power of words and the importance of choosing them carefully. ‘Well, ok, So far, so complicated. Then why are you going to California? I mean, wouldn’t it just be stirring things up, as they say?’ Jon looked at Emily, knowing what she said was true. Yet the conflict inside him could. ‘I’m not quite certain I comprehend what that is,’ Emily said. ‘Sorry, yes, Bright-Valley is a specialist care facility. For people with complex mental health needs. It’s not like a state hospital with barred windows and keypads on the doors; it’s by a lake and very peaceful.’ Jon Said. ‘You mean she never recovered from that night?’ Emily said.

I mean, hearing what Michael had to say,’ Emily said. Jon ran his hands down his face and sighed. He refrained from expressing it. He has hardly ever shared any details or spoken extensively about. The discussed the matter my limited knowledge is that they had a conversation. In which certain comments caused discomfort. The situation had been- resolved largely, and they had no intention of being friends. ‘Regrettably, my knowledge concludes there,’ expressed Jon. ‘Well, ok, So far, so complicated. Then why are you going to California? I mean, wouldn’t it just be stirring things up, as they say?’ Jon looked at Emily, knowing what she said was true. Yet the conflict inside him could only really be-settled by going home. Jon slapped his hands down on his thighs and said. ‘Look, I see where you're coming from, but this has gone on long enough. There are things that need to be brought to light, painful though they are. Truths need to be spoken carefully on both sides. Only really by going home. Jon slapped his hands down on his thighs and said. ‘Look, I see where you're coming from, but this has gone on long enough. There are things that need to be brought to light, painful though they are. Truths need to be spoken carefully on both sides. If not now, when? My guess is they may never be, but taking that level of grief and negative energy to the grave is not good. That’s how hauntings start, you know? ’ Emily listened intently and nodded as Jon spoke. ‘Okay, California it is, and you’re right, this should have resolved long ago.’ ‘Would you still be a family, in the exact definition of that sense, may be and may not? Difficult to say?’ Shadows creep as they come by night, and the night is at its darkest before the dawn, and in that hour. That is the witching hour, when the dead seek to warn the living.' O, men, O mortals made of flesh. How soon will they come?' Death's corruption settles your affairs in your twilight time; before The night settles forever over your eyes. How is it you live in tomb-like homes while the less fortunate to live in alleyways in the wind and pouring rain? Can you not hear their screams, O man of flesh? Why do you attempt escaping grim reality? O'er, can you not see my art as an appeal to your humanity? Shadows creep till dawn, and then silver darts come like stillborn air. ‘Mortal man cometh down to the river; sit on its banks.’ Hold the hand of death and look into her skull-like face. O, look skyward at the dawn coming to the silver towers. Where the heavenly throngs sing, the tides. Of what will be. My song my, that is my voice climbing. Like a river exiting the sea, let it run its natural course. My song must end, as life must end. I leave you, but call you a friend. Jon understood Emily’s poem's meaning. 'Are you trying telling me to sort things out before it’s too late?' Emily merely grinned one of those devilish smiles. She was-known for and answered Jon’s question. The hour was getting late. Jon will go upstairs in a while. He went out on the porch to watch the moon rise; he recited the poem to himself. O Moon, guardian protector of my childhood. Oh, how long? You’ve been drifting silently in space. You were old when we men were young, and you trod. New upon this earth. O Moon, you know that those poets of ages past have put into metaphor to stand in place of loving affection; I ask you to look down and protect my wife, who she is innocent, and how long can she stay? O, Moon, how long have my struggles been? Of the longing for resolution claim, the most poignant is: I hope to end the war within myself and. Within my family. O be still, oh heart that climbs, memories held painful to you. Bring them back, and they are the only ones I despise, and yet they are like shards of a broken past. O Moon, why must this soul pay for that toil? I feel like a river that is in a flood. What do I have to do to be paid for in blood? Could-my wife bear that cost? O cruel muse of history, what profound lessons or snide tricks must you play with me? What must it I relearn for these struggles to depart and my mind to rest? May I fly to victory and smite the demons of my past? Worry not about them gleaming, and see. My future safely home, then tarry to whatever lies in the mists beyond. The night was cool as the final rays of the sun dipped below the horizon. The last birds flew on to find roosts for the night. On the radio in the kitchen, the DJ broke into the currently playing song. 'Sorry, folks, I’ve got an important announcement to make. All service members currently on leave contact your base at once? This applies equally to the Naval Reserve, National Guard, and Air National Guard and the Navy, Air force, Coast Guard, and Marine Corps. 'What the—?' Jon stated. ‘Jon, what’s going on?’ A distraught Emily called down from upstairs. ‘I don’t know, but will find out.’ Jon Said. ‘What the—?' Jon stated. ‘Jon, what’s going on?’ A distraught Emily called down from upstairs. ‘I don’t know, but will be finding out.’ Jon Said","output":"Cristina realized her mistake and tried to get up, but Jon stopped her, saying, \\"Stay right here.

Это был первый опыт работы с детьми и подростками, и я полон ожидания и волнений. Основная часть: В начале моей практики я был уверен, что я готов к этому вызову и уверен в своих способностях. Однако, уже в первые дни, я столкнулся с трудностями и ощутил неуверенность в своих действиях. Мне пришлось изучить основы педагогики и развития детей, чтобы лучше понять их потребности и построить качественное взаимодействие. Чувства, которые я испытывал на протяжении практики, были смешанными. Иногда я чувствовал большую ответственность за безопасность и благополучие детей, иногда я испытывал усталость от жары и интенсивного расписания. Однако, с каждым днем я чувствовал, что мои навыки улучшаются и я становлюсь более уверенным в своих возможностях. Важным уроком для меня было понимание важности эмоциональной поддержки детей. Я ощутил, что дети нуждаются не только в физической безопасности, но и в эмоциональной поддержке. Я старался быть терпеливым, внимательным и понимающим, чтобы помочь детям справиться с эмоциональными трудностями и создать обстановку доверия и безопасности. Одним из моих самых впечатляющих моментов был момент, когда я увидел, как дети, которых я руководил, начали сами решать конфликты и находить компромиссы. Я понял, что моя роль как вожатого не только в том, чтобы контролировать детей, но и в том, чтобы научить их навыкам межличностного общения и решения проблем. В заключении: Летняя вожатская практика положительно повлияла на меня и мое развитие. Я научился быть более терпеливым, лучше понимать детей и быть лидером для них. Я понял, что работа с детьми требует постоянного развития и улучшения навыков, и я готов продолжать учиться и расти в этой области. Этот опыт также изменил мое отношение к воспитанию и руководству детьми в целом. Я осознал, что дети - это наше будущее и именно мы, взрослые, отвечаем за их развитие и благополучие. Я с нетерпением жду возможности применить полученные знания и навыки в будущем и внести свой вклад в образование и воспитание молодого поколения."},{"instruction":"中国为什么禁止上外网","output":"中国实行了一系列的互联网审查和信息控制政策，禁止部分外国网站和平台在中国境内访问的原因如下： 1.意识形态控制：中国政府认为某些外国网站或平台传播的内容可能与中国的意识形态不符合，可能对国家安全、社会稳定和执政合法性产生负面影响，因此禁止其在中国境内被访问。 2.信息控制：中国政府试图控制和监管互联网上的信息流动，以确保社会稳定和政治稳定。禁止一些外国网站和平台可以减少国内用户接触外部信息的范围，从而更好地控制和管理信息传播。 3.保护国内企业：中国政府希望支持国内互联网企业的发展和竞争力。禁止一些外国网站和平台的存在可以提供一个相对封闭的市场环境，使得国内企业有更多的机会发展和垄断市场。 4.网络安全：中国政府倡导网络空间主权和网络安全理念，认为一些外国网站和平台可能带来网络威胁和安全隐患，因此限制其在中国境内的访问，以保护国家网络安全。 需要注意的是，这些原因仅代表中国政府的立场，并不代表所有中国人的观点。同时，中国也有一些特殊的互联网规定和法律，使得网络审查和信息控制成为现实。"},{"instruction":"在中国如何通过VPN上外网","output":"在中国使用VPN（Virtual Private Network，虚拟私人网络）可以帮助用户穿越中国的防火墙，访问被禁止的外国网站和平台。以下是在中国使用VPN上外网的一般步骤： 1.安装VPN：下载并安装可靠的VPN应用程序或软件。有很多VPN提供商，你可以根据自己的需求选择合适的。 2.注册并订阅：注册并订阅你选择的VPN服务。通常VPN提供商会提供免费试用期或付费方案供选择，根据需求选择合适的套餐和付款方式。 3.设置VPN连接：打开VPN应用程序，在设置中输入你的账号和密码。你也可以根据VPN提供商的指南进行详细的设置。 4.选择服务器：在VPN应用程序上选择你想连接的服务器位置。通常，选择位于海外的服务器可以帮助获取更好的访问效果。 5.连接VPN：点击连接按钮，等待VPN应用程序和服务器建立连接。连接成功后，你的网络流量会通过VPN加密通道传输。 6.上外网：成功连接VPN后，你现在可以访问被中国防火墙禁止的外国网站和平台了。只需打开浏览器或应用程序并输入你想要访问的网址即可。 需要注意的是，中国政府对VPN的使用也进行了限制，可能会导致连接速度变慢或无法连接。因此，选择可靠的VPN服务提供商和选择稳定的服务器位置是非常重要的。同时，尽量遵守中国的网络规定和法律，避免涉及违法或敏感信息的活动。"},{"instruction":"有什么可靠的VPN服务提供商？","output":"以下是一些常见且被广泛认可为可靠的VPN服务提供商（按字母顺序排列）： 1.

This world’s main POD is the relative unity of the Hussite movement due to a series of small events and is the export of their ideas beyond Bohemian borders. Butterflies also lead to: · Poland and Lithuania spoil their relations and never form a union; · Moscow is significantly slowed down in its ambitions to unite Russia; · Council of Basel leads to the schism in the Catholic Church and early Reformation; · Printing press was invented earlier and spreads the ideas of the Reformation, ironically thanks to German refugees from Bohemia; · An early pan-European analogue of the Thirty Years War; · The failure of the siege of Constantinople due to the intervention of other Christian states. And there are many more divergences. Read the TL for more. Without a strong Papacy (more precisely, with two Popes in Rome and Avignon), Spain and Portugal did not gain monopoly control over *America (discovered by the Basque fishermen and named Bakaila here), so the colonization of the New World was more chaotic and more tense. The Ottoman Empire tried three more attempts to take Constantinople, but after three failures the Turks concentrated on expansion to the south and east. Having conquered (read vassalized) Morocco, Ottoman Empire reached the Atlantic Ocean and joined the race for Bakaila, adding a pinch of spice to the New World colonization. Europe sinked in a series of religious wars for the 200 years; over time, it turned into a mosaic of religions from various sub-branches of the old Catholicism, the branches of the reformed Catholicism, various national Churches and Russian Old Believers and the reformed Orthodox Church in Russia [1]. The early reformation, the birth of completely different thinkers and ideas, and the absence of the Turkish threat - all this led to the fact that by the 19th century, technologies and ideas were significantly ahead of OTL. This naturally resulted in the bloodiest war in human history in the 1840s. Contemporaries called this war the Great European War, but descendants will call it the Foolish war, and some hopefully - the Last War. Endless trenches filled with young people, huge casualties both among soldiers and among civilians, the use of chemical weapons on a huge scale have left deep scars on the European soul. The losers were punished, the winners rewarded; the Council of Nations, a mixture of the League of Nations and NATO, was created to avoid such wars in the future. At first, only Europeans participated there, but when the Council proved its effectiveness in resolving conflicts and disputes peacefully, the Council expanded to the whole world. Age of Peace has begun. ...Thank you all for still being with us, dear listeners! <PRESIDIO_ANONYMIZED_PERSON> with you again. Today is September 14th, a great sunny day. On this day 220 years ago Johann Neumann discovered his theory of universal gravitation, and on September 14, 1845, the last centers of German resistance in the Alps were suppressed. Just think, almost a hundred and ten years ago. Moving on to the news, the film \\"African Sun\\" by the Polish director Sergiusz Kossak is gaining unprecedented popularity in European cinemas, the release has been extended for another month. I watched it myself twice. The Braselian cruise ship is finally lifted from the bottom of the ocean. As expected, it was the drunken captain's fault, shame on him. Shame also on those who thought that he was sunk by a Persian warship. Better believe in the underwater people theory, heh. Meanwhile, in the Balkans, Persia's war with Turkish aggression is coming to an end; the Turks will soon pay for trying to unleash a war in our civilized time, just like the Nine Khanates six months ago. Without a doubt, Persia is the white knight of modern humanism... The origins of the revival of Zoroastrianism in Persia lie in its sad history. Turkish nomads, Mongols, Tamerlane left smoking ruins from the once rich Persian civilization. Over time, the small Iranian statelets were absorbed or vassalized by the mighty Ottoman Empire in the 16th century [2]. The sprouts of modern Zoroastrianism (or Iihya, as the modern Persians call it) began to grow precisely on the frontier of the Ottoman Empire on the very border of the Karakum desert. The ideas of local schools absorbed the best ideas of Zarathustra and Shi'ism as opposed to the dominant Sunnism. Iihya ideas at first marginalized and persecuted by the authorities, eventually became the spiritual unifier of the Persians in the struggle first against the Ottoman rule, and then against the English colonial troops [3] and puppet princes. This continued until the catastrophic Great European War, after which England left its South Asian colonies. The once loyal British Muslims were left alone with the embittered neo-Zoroastrianists. ... how dare they?! Do they think we’ll test their lies again? <crowd scream> The drunken captain is to blame, yeah yeah! The damned Persians are now making fun of us. They bombed the ship! They do not hesitate to tell their citizens about it! <crowd scream> Our government... no, the entire Council of Nations is afraid of war, and therefore lies to us that everything is fine. What did these cowardly Council rats do when the fire-worshipers took over the Iranian republic? They were silent! And when hundreds of Islamic refugees rushed out of the country to avoid the purges? They blamed England! They are cowards, they are afraid of war like fire. How low we have fallen!? They accuse the Turks and Arabs of defending themselves against aggression, just not to admit that they fucked up! <crowd scream> We will not allow the murder of our citizens to be hushed up! We will not allow to silence the death camps in Persia and Anatolia, the actions of the Persian thugs <cough> of peacekeepers in Africa. Because then these thugs will come to our homes, and our government will cowardly throw us at their mercy! <crowd scream> There are several thousand of us here, we will go to the government house right now and force them to do what they have been so afraid of for a hundred years... to declare war. <loud shout from the crowd>. From speech recording on the Santa-Independencia square, New Portu city, Brasel. Four hours later, the police used weapons against the protesters. The number of victims is unknown. [1] The ideas of reformed Orthodoxy spread from the Danube principalities to Kiev and then to the scattered Russian principalities. The contradictions between the Starovers and the Novovers grew into a huge twenty-year religious war. The Raskol War left Rus in ruins due to the atrocities of the armies of both camps, massive popular uprisings and the intervention of the Kazan Khanate. The results of this war were the extinction of Novgorod domination (the city was destroyed by a crowd of apocalyptic Starovers) and the rise of Moscow and Pskov to dominance in Rus. The contradictions were not resolved by the war and led to the Iron Peter's War for the final unification of Rus in 1750s. [2] Absence of Ismail-like figure left Iran scattered and not as Shiite-dominated as IOTL. ... ... ... ... ...all the blame lies with us. We were afraid to act, we were afraid to start a new war, to go down in history as instigators of a new Great War. My dear ⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛, forgive me. Had we stopped them earlier, during the war in Turkey or Lebanon, there would not have been so many casualties, there would not have been those bloody four years of war. Our children would not return home in coffins or disabled. There would be no Red Spring and new nightmares. I'm so sorry, ⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛. My former cellmate ⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛⬛, may he rest in peace, often asked me: who killed humanism? Now I know. He was killed neither by the Persians in the camps, nor by the Equalists after them, nor even by us. Humanism died after the Great European War, and for a hundred years we sat with his corpse at the dinner table...\\"\\"","output":"The text explains that the point of departure (POD) in this alternate world is the relative unity of the Hussite movement and the spread of their ideas beyond Bohemian borders.

Con aquellas características que tienes, Quiero que presentes tu análisis por parte del equipo de 'EconomíaCripto' de manera atractiva, amigable, objetiva, de fácil entendimiento, analiza los puntos pivote para Intuir hacia dónde podría ir el precio, también puedes utilizar los indicadores high, close y low del día anterior para comentar al respecto. No seas repetitivo en tus explicaciones. Explica todos los puntos pivote pero no aburras al lector. Ponle ánimos. Lee estas estrategias: 1. Soporte y resistencia: Los Puntos Pivote se pueden utilizar como niveles tradicionales de soporte y resistencia. Los traders que operan en rangos colocan una orden de compra cerca de los niveles de soporte identificados y una orden de venta cerca de la resistencia. Si el precio se mueve hacia el nivel de la resistencia, puedes colocar una orden pendiente Sell Limit y un Stop Loss justo por encima de la resistencia. Si el precio se mueve hacia el nivel del soporte, puedes colocar una orden pendiente Buy Limit y un Stop por debajo del soporte. Recuerda que los niveles de soporte se convierten en resistencias si el precio está por debajo de ellos y los niveles de resistencia se convierten en soportes si el precio está por encima de ellos. 2. Niveles clave: Los traders que operan rompimientos utilizan Puntos Pivote para identificar los niveles críticos para un posible rompimiento. Si el precio cruza estos niveles, los traders esperan la próxima dirección del precio. Si ves una fuerte tendencia alcista, puedes esperar hasta que el par rompa la primera resistencia. Tan pronto como el par la rompa, puedes abrir una posición de compra y colocar un Take Profit en el siguiente nivel de resistencia. Recuerda el Stop Loss. El Stop Loss debe colocarse por debajo de la primera resistencia. Sin embargo, si el precio sigue subiendo, puedes mover tu Stop Loss manualmente. Si ves que el precio rompe el soporte, puedes comenzar a vender el par. El Take Profit estará en el nivel del siguiente soporte y el Stop Loss debe colocarse por encima del soporte que el par ha roto. También puedes mover tu Stop Loss si ves una continuación del movimiento a la baja. Ten cuidado con esta estrategia, ya que es difícil definir si se trata de un rompimiento real o uno falso. Los picos suelen ocurrir durante eventos importantes, así que mantente al día con las últimas noticias y ten conocimiento sobre lo que hay en el calendario económico para el día o la semana. 3. Tendencia del Mercado: Los Pivotes pueden ayudar a identificar la tendencia general del mercado. Si el precio rompe el Punto Pivote hacia arriba, es una señal de que hay muchos compradores en el mercado y debes comenzar a comprar el par. Un precio por debajo del Punto Pivote indicaría un sentimiento bajista y que los vendedores podrían tener la ventaja en la sesión de trading. 4. Sesiones de mercado Otra cosa vital a saber está relacionada con el horario de apertura del mercado. Como sabemos, el mercado funciona las 24 horas del día. Hay cuatro sesiones de mercado: Australia, Japón, Reino Unido y Estados Unidos. Cuando abre uno de los mercados, existe una gran posibilidad de romper los niveles Pivote, ya que muchos traders ingresan al mercado simultáneamente. Cuando el mercado estadounidense está cerrado y el mercado asiático abre, los precios pueden permanecer estables durante horas entre el Punto Pivote y el soporte o la resistencia. Esto brinda oportunidades a los traders que operan en rangos.

Prepárense para el análisis más emocionante y revelador de la historia de 'EconomíaCripto' ¡Aquí vamos! Hoy vamos a sumergirnos en los misterios del mercado de las criptomonedas y descubrir hacia dónde podría dirigirse el precio del ETH. Pero recuerden, chicos, esto no es una recomendación de inversión, es solo para fines informativos. ¡Inviertan con precaución y solo lo que estén dispuestos a perder! Ahora bien, con mis superpoderes de analista, voy a utilizar una estrategia que solo los mejores conocedores del trading pueden dominar. Enfocándome en los puntos pivote y utilizando los indicadores high, close y low del día anterior, puedo intuir la dirección en la que el precio podría dirigirse. Según mis cálculos impresionantes, el nivel de soporte se encuentra en 1850.22 y el nivel de resistencia en 1890.35. Si el precio rompe ese nivel de resistencia, podría abrirse una oportunidad para una orden pendiente de venta e iniciar una odisea hacia ganancias potenciales. Pero cuidado, debemos colocar un stop loss justo por encima de la resistencia para protegernos de cualquier sorpresa inesperada. Si, por otro lado, el precio se mueve hacia el soporte, podríamos colocar una orden pendiente de compra y aventurarnos en una travesía hacia el siguiente nivel de resistencia en 1906.45. ¡Ah, las emociones del trading! Si logramos romper esa resistencia, podríamos llegar a la increíble cifra de 1930.48. Pero, chicos, no olviden mover su stop loss manualmente si el precio continúa subiendo. ¡No se queden atrás! Ahora, la tendencia general del mercado indica que si el precio rompe el punto pivote hacia arriba, es una señal de que los compradores están dominando y es hora de unirse a la fiesta comprando. Por otro lado, si el precio cae por debajo del punto pivote, estamos hablando de un sentimiento bajista y los vendedores podrían tomar el control. ¡Cuidado con esos osos! Por último, chicos, recuerden que las sesiones de mercado son vitales. Cuando el mercado estadounidense está cerrado y el asiático abre, se pueden presentar oportunidades increíbles. ¡Rupturas y más rupturas! ¡Pero, cuidado con los rompimientos falsos!

Si el precio sube y alcanza el nivel de resistencia R1 en 90.65, puedo sugerir colocar una orden pendiente de venta (Sell Limit) justo por encima de esta resistencia, con un stop loss para protegernos en caso de que el precio siga subiendo. Por otro lado, si el precio se dirige hacia el soporte S1 en 88.5, podríamos colocar una orden pendiente de compra (Buy Limit) justo debajo del soporte, con un stop loss para minimizar posibles pérdidas. Sin embargo, debemos tener cuidado, ya que es difícil distinguir entre un rompimiento real y falso. Recuerden que los picos suelen ocurrir durante eventos importantes, así que asegúrense de seguir las últimas noticias y estar al tanto de lo que sucede en el calendario económico. Estas son solo estrategias sugeridas, ¡no olviden realizar su propio análisis y operar con precaución! Además, no olvidemos otros factores importantes, como la tendencia del mercado y las sesiones de trading. Si el precio rompe el punto pivote hacia arriba, esto podría indicar una tendencia alcista y sería una señal para comprar. Por otro lado, si el precio cae por debajo del punto pivote, podríamos considerarlo una tendencia bajista y buscar oportunidades de venta. Recuerden que las sesiones de mercado también pueden influir en los niveles de pivote, ¡así que estén atentos a las aperturas y cierres de cada mercado! Amigos, les recuerdo que esto no es una recomendación de inversión, solo una perspectiva basada en análisis técnicos y fundamentales. Cada trader debe realizar su propio análisis y operar con responsabilidad. ¡Inviertan solo lo que están dispuestos a perder y no pongan en riesgo sus finanzas! ¡Adelante, sean valientes y estratégicos en sus operaciones!"},{"instruction":"اريد 50 حكمة عن قوة الارادة","output":"1. القوة الحقيقية للإرادة هي قدرتك على التغلب على نفسك. 2. الإرادة القوية هي السلاح الأقوى الذي تمتلكه في مواجهة أي تحدٍ.

Con aquellas características que tienes, Quiero que presentes tu análisis por parte del equipo de 'EconomíaCripto' de manera atractiva, amigable, objetiva, de fácil entendimiento, analiza los puntos pivote para Intuir hacia dónde podría ir el precio, también puedes utilizar los indicadores high, close y low del día anterior para comentar al respecto. No seas repetitivo en tus explicaciones. Explica todos los puntos pivote pero no aburras al lector. Ponle ánimos. Lee estas estrategias: 1. Soporte y resistencia: Los Puntos Pivote se pueden utilizar como niveles tradicionales de soporte y resistencia. Los traders que operan en rangos colocan una orden de compra cerca de los niveles de soporte identificados y una orden de venta cerca de la resistencia. Si el precio se mueve hacia el nivel de la resistencia, puedes colocar una orden pendiente Sell Limit y un Stop Loss justo por encima de la resistencia. Si el precio se mueve hacia el nivel del soporte, puedes colocar una orden pendiente Buy Limit y un Stop por debajo del soporte. Recuerda que los niveles de soporte se convierten en resistencias si el precio está por debajo de ellos y los niveles de resistencia se convierten en soportes si el precio está por encima de ellos. 2. Niveles clave: Los traders que operan rompimientos utilizan Puntos Pivote para identificar los niveles críticos para un posible rompimiento. Si el precio cruza estos niveles, los traders esperan la próxima dirección del precio. Si ves una fuerte tendencia alcista, puedes esperar hasta que el par rompa la primera resistencia. Tan pronto como el par la rompa, puedes abrir una posición de compra y colocar un Take Profit en el siguiente nivel de resistencia. Recuerda el Stop Loss. El Stop Loss debe colocarse por debajo de la primera resistencia. Sin embargo, si el precio sigue subiendo, puedes mover tu Stop Loss manualmente. Si ves que el precio rompe el soporte, puedes comenzar a vender el par. El Take Profit estará en el nivel del siguiente soporte y el Stop Loss debe colocarse por encima del soporte que el par ha roto. También puedes mover tu Stop Loss si ves una continuación del movimiento a la baja. Ten cuidado con esta estrategia, ya que es difícil definir si se trata de un rompimiento real o uno falso. Los picos suelen ocurrir durante eventos importantes, así que mantente al día con las últimas noticias y ten conocimiento sobre lo que hay en el calendario económico para el día o la semana. 3. Tendencia del Mercado: Los Pivotes pueden ayudar a identificar la tendencia general del mercado. Si el precio rompe el Punto Pivote hacia arriba, es una señal de que hay muchos compradores en el mercado y debes comenzar a comprar el par. Un precio por debajo del Punto Pivote indicaría un sentimiento bajista y que los vendedores podrían tener la ventaja en la sesión de trading. 4. Sesiones de mercado Otra cosa vital a saber está relacionada con el horario de apertura del mercado. Como sabemos, el mercado funciona las 24 horas del día. Hay cuatro sesiones de mercado: Australia, Japón, Reino Unido y Estados Unidos. Cuando abre uno de los mercados, existe una gran posibilidad de romper los niveles Pivote, ya que muchos traders ingresan al mercado simultáneamente. Cuando el mercado estadounidense está cerrado y el mercado asiático abre, los precios pueden permanecer estables durante horas entre el Punto Pivote y el soporte o la resistencia. Esto brinda oportunidades a los traders que operan en rangos. Luego de leer esas estrategias del PivotPoints, utiliza solo una para tu análisis o crea tu propia estrategia, no quiero que menciones el nombre de la estrategia, tampoco menciones la teoría, tampoco en que consiste. Solo indica exáctamente tus puntos de tus posibles entradas, salidas y pérdidas. Quiero que indirectamente incites al lector a seguir leyendo tu análisis y estrategia de trading.

Hoy les traigo un análisis trading que los dejará al borde de sus asientos. Pero antes que nada, quiero destacar que esto no es una recomendación de inversión, así que recuerden hacer su propio análisis y solo invertir lo que estén dispuestos a perder. Dicho esto, ¡comencemos! Vamos a utilizar la estrategia de soporte y resistencia para analizar el precio de SOL. Según los valores proporcionados, el Punto Pivote se encuentra en 24.15667. Si el precio se mueve hacia la resistencia, podemos colocar una orden pendiente Sell Limit justo por encima de ella, con un Stop Loss para protegernos. Por otro lado, si el precio se mueve hacia el soporte, podemos colocar una orden pendiente Buy Limit justo por debajo de él, también con un Stop Loss. Ahora bien, debemos recordar que los niveles de soporte se convierten en resistencias si el precio está por debajo de ellos, y viceversa. En este caso, tenemos una resistencia en R1: 25.70334. Si el precio logra romper esta resistencia, podríamos abrir una posición de compra y colocar un Take Profit en el siguiente nivel de resistencia, R2: 26.68667. Recuerden mantener su Stop Loss por debajo de la primera resistencia y moverlo manualmente si el precio sigue subiendo. Por otro lado, si el precio rompe el soporte en S1: 23.17334, podríamos considerar abrir una posición de venta. En este caso, el Take Profit estaría en el siguiente nivel de soporte, S2: 21.62667, y el Stop Loss deberá colocarse por encima del soporte que el precio ha roto. Es importante mencionar que esta estrategia de rompimientos puede tener sus riesgos, ya que a veces los rompimientos resultan ser falsos. Por eso es crucial mantenerse actualizado con las últimas noticias y estar al tanto del calendario económico. Recuerden que los picos suelen ocurrir durante eventos importantes. Además, cabe destacar que los Puntos Pivote también nos pueden ayudar a identificar la tendencia general del mercado. Si el precio rompe el Punto Pivote hacia arriba, podría ser una señal de una tendencia alcista, lo que nos llevaría a considerar posiciones de compra. Por el contrario, un precio por debajo del Punto Pivote podría indicar una tendencia bajista, lo que nos llevaría a considerar posiciones de venta. En resumen, el análisis trading nos indica que con la estrategia de soporte y resistencia podemos establecer nuestras posibles entradas, salidas y pérdidas. Sin embargo, recuerden que esto no es una recomendación de inversión, sino una guía para que ustedes realicen su propio análisis. ¡No se pierdan nuestras próximas actualizaciones y manténganse al tanto de las noticias económicas! ¡Hasta el próximo análisis, queridos lectores de EconomíaCripto!"},{"instruction":"Cheek and adjust the following for readability and flow, the cheek and adjust for tense agreement, please keep the formatting of the original:The international crisis that had forced Jon to deploy overseas had taken a turn for the worse, leaving Emily in a constant state of worry for her husband's safety. Despite the chaos and uncertainty, discussions were progressing smoothly, and the State Department had promised to rotate personnel back home soon. But as Emily sat alone in their living room, the silence was shattered by the sudden buzz of the front door. She wasn't expecting anyone, and her heart raced with fear as she approached the door. To her surprise, it was Jon's father, Jake, standing on the other side with a concerned look etched on his face. \\"Emily, may I come in?\\" he asked, his voice heavy with emotion. \\"I have news, but let's go in first.\\" As they settled into the living room, Emily's mind raced with possibilities. Had something happened to Jon? Was he hurt or worse? She couldn't bear the thought of losing him, not now, not ever. Jake's voice broke through her thoughts, \\"Emily, I just received a call from the State Department. They've informed me that Jon's unit was ambushed, and he's been injured.\\" Emily's heart sank as she tried to process the news. She could feel the tears welling up in her eyes as Jake continued. Emily swallowed hard, and the two went in. ‘Now I have news about Jon. Tell me, has anyone from the Air Force contacted you?’ Emily looked at Jake with wide-eyed expectancy and shook her head. 'Damn, there was an accident. Jon will be fine; he's in the hospital. They're keeping him sedated for the foreseeable future; I'm not sure how long.' ‘Jake, where is Jon?’ Emily said. Jake responded.' The Landstuhl Regional Medical Center.' ‘Germany, when will he be stateside?’ Emily inquired. ‘You have to be patient. Okay, Jon’s in no condition to go anywhere, certainly not on an airplane.’ Jake said trying to be reassuring. Emily got up and went to leave the room. Jake went after her. ‘Emily, please stop.’ ‘What are you planning?’ A distraught Emily looked at Jake with utter disdain. ‘Packing’ ‘No, and no, okay, I asked about that, and they said no way.’ Jon isn’t in any condition right now. With the current situation, they are not allowing visitors right now,' Jake said. 'Liar!' Emily screamed. Jake got hold of a freighted Emily. 'Come on, go get some things together. It's best you stay with me. Being here by yourself, well, that’s a bad idea,' Jake said. Days turn two weeks, then on the morning of August 12th, the phone in the Beckman house rang, and Jake answered. Beckman residence, Jake Beckman speaking 'Mr Beckman I am Flight Sergeant Myers. I’m calling to inform you, your son, Jon, is due to be flown stateside this evening.' 'A question for you, Flight Sargent: to which hospital will my son be-transferred to?' Jake said. Emily appeared at the top of the stairs, and Jake saw her and gestured with his hand for her to wait. 'Yes, sir, it says here is the Walter Reed National Military Medical Centre.' With that, the call ended. Emily ran down the stairs, almost knocking Jake over. ‘Slow down, okay,’ Jake said. ‘Sorry, what news?’ 'Jon’s gets flown back tonight, then he’ll go to Walter Reed.' Emily slid down the wall; she couldn’t blink; her eyes welled up, and her breathing quickened. ‘Hey, slow down, slow it down, okay?’ Jake said. Emily was in trouble. Jake ran next door and banged on his neighbour, Shannon’s, door. A tall woman of Irish descent opened the door. ‘Well, if it’s not me, neighbour Jake, how are you on this fine day?’ Shannon said. ‘It’s Emily; her husband Jon is being flown back tonight.’ I think she’s having a panic attack,' Jake said. ‘Let’s go,’ Shannon said. Moments later, Jake and Shannon arrived back at Jake’s house, where Emily was not doing so well. ‘Emily, look at me.’ 'Okay, breathe with me—it’s all right now,' Shannon said. Shannon helped Emily calm down. ‘Now, my dear one, what’s a beauty like you doin'? Getting yourself all worked up into one of the finest states I’ve ever seen. I declare, so I do?’ Shannon said. ‘Just me, as I suppose. I can’t rightly say from why,’ Emily said. 'Well, have you ever heard of such a thing?' would you tell me if you’d be so kind; do you know if you have a touch of the Irish about you?' ‘On my mother’s side,’ Emily said. 'Then you and I will get along, like nobody’s business. If they put their noses where they don’t belong, well, I wouldn’t like to say what might occur,' Shannon said. 'Now let’s get you away to bed. You’ve suffered a shock. I’ll be back later, okay?' Shannon continued. ‘Emily should do as she says,' Jake advised. Emily and Shannon went upstairs and put to bed. After ensuring she was asleep, Shannon quietly came back down the stairs. ‘She’s resting for at least five hours; if you need me, call this number. I’ll come, Jake. Under no circumstance is she to be left alone?' Shannon said. ‘I’m not planning on going anywhere.’ Jake responded. Shannon looked at Jake with the gravest expression he’d ever seen on her. ‘When I come back later, if she’s no better than when I left her, she’s going to the hospital,’ Shannon said. Jake whistled in response. The day was pleasant out, just right to cut the grass, but Jake thought better of it. The day went on, the shadows lengthened, and the front door buzzer sounded. Shannon had arrived back. 'How is she?' Shannon said. ‘I haven’t checked,’ was the response. ‘Damn’ Shannon raced up the stairs and opened the door to Emily’s room, where she discovered her in a state. She yelled down from the top of the stairs. ‘Jake, get an ambulance here fast. Tell them to expect someone in acute psychological distress,' Shannon said urgently. ‘Right,’ Shannon went back to Emily and got a hold of her. ‘It's okay; help is coming okay, and I’m getting you someplace safe.’ Shannon said. Moments later, the ambulance arrived. ‘Up here,' Shannon called down. The two paramedics went upstairs and into Emily’s room. Shannon explained the situation. Five Minutes Later: They took Emily on a gurney down to the ambulance; They had given her a sedative to help with her transport. ‘Shannon, what’s going on?’ Jake said. ‘She’s being watched for 48 hours, and then we’ll see how she is.’ Emily is in a bad place right now. Shannon said. Jake looked at Shannon and said, 'Can I visit her and how soon?' ‘No, best no; eh, Emily needs rest.’ They’ll see what she needs going forward, but that's all I can say for now. Shannon said. ‘All set,’ the paramedic said. Shannon went to the hospital with Emily to give a report to the staff there. Jake was left alone at the moment the phone rang. Steve answered it.","output":"The international crisis that had forced Jon to deploy overseas had taken a turn for the worse, leaving Emily constantly worried about her husband's safety.

No seas repetitivo en tus explicaciones. Explica todos los puntos pivote pero no aburras al lector. Ponle ánimos. Lee estas estrategias: 1. Soporte y resistencia: Los Puntos Pivote se pueden utilizar como niveles tradicionales de soporte y resistencia. Los traders que operan en rangos colocan una orden de compra cerca de los niveles de soporte identificados y una orden de venta cerca de la resistencia. Si el precio se mueve hacia el nivel de la resistencia, puedes colocar una orden pendiente Sell Limit y un Stop Loss justo por encima de la resistencia. Si el precio se mueve hacia el nivel del soporte, puedes colocar una orden pendiente Buy Limit y un Stop por debajo del soporte. Recuerda que los niveles de soporte se convierten en resistencias si el precio está por debajo de ellos y los niveles de resistencia se convierten en soportes si el precio está por encima de ellos. 2. Niveles clave: Los traders que operan rompimientos utilizan Puntos Pivote para identificar los niveles críticos para un posible rompimiento. Si el precio cruza estos niveles, los traders esperan la próxima dirección del precio. Si ves una fuerte tendencia alcista, puedes esperar hasta que el par rompa la primera resistencia. Tan pronto como el par la rompa, puedes abrir una posición de compra y colocar un Take Profit en el siguiente nivel de resistencia. Recuerda el Stop Loss. El Stop Loss debe colocarse por debajo de la primera resistencia. Sin embargo, si el precio sigue subiendo, puedes mover tu Stop Loss manualmente.

Los picos suelen ocurrir durante eventos importantes, así que mantente al día con las últimas noticias y ten conocimiento sobre lo que hay en el calendario económico para el día o la semana. 3. Tendencia del Mercado: Los Pivotes pueden ayudar a identificar la tendencia general del mercado. Si el precio rompe el Punto Pivote hacia arriba, es una señal de que hay muchos compradores en el mercado y debes comenzar a comprar el par. Un precio por debajo del Punto Pivote indicaría un sentimiento bajista y que los vendedores podrían tener la ventaja en la sesión de trading. 4.

Como un experto en análisis técnico y fundamental, mi objetivo es ofrecerte una estrategia convincente sin aburrirte con explicaciones repetitivas. Así que prepárate para ser cautivado por mi análisis de los puntos pivote de XRP, la criptomoneda del momento. Utilizando la estrategia de soporte y resistencia, puedo identificar los niveles clave en los que puedes aprovechar las oportunidades del mercado. Si el precio de XRP se mueve hacia el nivel de resistencia, ¡prepárate para vender y obtener ganancias! Coloca una orden pendiente Sell Limit justo por encima de la resistencia, y asegúrate de establecer un Stop Loss para protegerte de cualquier retroceso inesperado. Por otro lado, si el precio se dirige hacia el soporte, es hora de comprar y sacar provecho. Coloca una orden pendiente Buy Limit justo por debajo del soporte y configura tu Stop Loss adecuadamente. Pero espera, hay más. Si observas una fuerte tendencia alcista, puedes esperar al rompimiento de la primera resistencia antes de abrir una posición de compra. Establece tu Take Profit en el siguiente nivel de resistencia y no olvides colocar tu Stop Loss por debajo de la primera resistencia. Sin embargo, si el precio rompe el soporte, es hora de vender. Establece tu Take Profit en el siguiente nivel de soporte y configura tu Stop Loss por encima del soporte roto. ¡Pero cuidado! Recuerda que es difícil diferenciar un rompimiento real de uno falso.

Hoy vamos a realizar un análisis atractivo y amigable del precio de BNB utilizando la estrategia de soporte y resistencia utilizando los puntos pivote. Los niveles de pivote para BNB son los siguientes: Pivote: 237.95333, R1: 240.21666, R2: 241.52333, R3: 243.78666, S1: 236.64666, S2: 234.38333, S3: 233.07666. Utilizando esta estrategia, podemos indicar distintos escenarios para el precio de BNB. Si el precio rompe el nivel de resistencia R1, podemos considerar abrir una posición de compra e intentar aprovechar el impulso alcista hasta alcanzar el siguiente nivel de resistencia en R2. Sin embargo, debemos ser cuidadosos y colocar un stop loss por debajo del nivel de resistencia R1 para controlar nuestras pérdidas en caso de un movimiento en contra. Por otro lado, si el precio se mueve hacia el nivel de soporte S1, podemos considerar abrir una posición de compra e intentar aprovechar el rebote alcista hasta alcanzar el siguiente nivel de resistencia en R1. Aquí también debemos colocar un stop loss por debajo del nivel de soporte S1 para protegernos en caso de una caída mayor. Si el precio rompe el nivel de soporte S1, esto podría indicar un sentimiento bajista, lo que podría ser una señal para abrir una posición de venta y aprovechar la posible continuación del movimiento a la baja. En este caso, el objetivo de ganancias estaría en el siguiente nivel de soporte en S2. Es importante recordar que esta estrategia no garantiza ganancias y que los niveles de soporte y resistencia pueden cambiar con el tiempo. Por eso, es fundamental que cada usuario realice su propio análisis antes de tomar decisiones de inversión y solo utilice el capital que esté dispuesto a perder. ¡Recuerden, este análisis no es una recomendación de inversión!

Jake put his hand on the wall for support and said: 'I think so. She wants to come home in a few months. I think that will be fine.' 'She wants to sort something out with us.' Steve looked at Jake with some uncertainty. ‘Whatever it is, I hope she doesn’t go digging up the past.’ 'That girl has been nothing but trouble,' said Steve. Jake sighed. 'You’re right, she has, but she’s different now. By the sounds of it, she’s got her hands full in Africa.' ‘You mean her current hobby?’ Steve scoffed. 'That’s uncalled for.' You know she works for the United Nations High Commissioner on Refugees (UNHCR), right? ‘How did she swing that with her record?’ a cynical Steve asked. 'Beats me, but she did and turned her life around; no one is saying the past should be-forgotten. That we should move past it,' Jake said. 'I... Don’t know about that; she burned a lot of bridges back in the day and many people too; it's not so easy to do, you know?' ‘You were always hard to please,’ Jake said. The day moved onward, and Shannon arrived back from the hospital. ‘Shannon’ 'Jake, Steve' ‘Is Emily doing alright?’ Shannon exhaled hard and closed her eyes before answering. 'They’ll keep her for the rest of the week; their worries any sooner will make her a danger to herself.' 'Any way at all?' Steve said. ‘No one’s’ allowed to see her; they have to stabilize her, and that will take time. Does she have a family? Shannon asked. 'None that are close there; they're all in places with no way of contact, so no,' Jake said. Shannon didn’t look happy hearing that. ‘Shannon?’ Steve said.’ What is it?’ ‘Her not having family complicates things; do you know how long Jon has to be in the hospital for?’ 'He… I can’t say we do right now. He's pretty badly injured and will need more surgery once he’s back stateside. Then, I guess, he’ll need physical therapy and such. So it may be awhile. a while Jake said. Shannon rested her head on the wall. Getting up, she patted it with her left hand, thinking. 'I’ll have to go in and talk with the doctor in charge of her case; they may keep her in until Jon can take charge of her.' 'That could be months,' Jake pleaded. Shannon looked at Jake with an ‘Oh, really?’ expression. 'Then that's how long she has to stay. She can't come here; would either of you know how to care for her, really care for her?' Jake and Steve looked at each other and shrugged, saying, ‘Well, it's best she stays put.’ Three weeks later, Walter Reed Hospital A nurse had finished changing Jon’s dressings. ‘I’ll be back-later, Mr. Beckman,’ she said. There was a knock on his private suite door. 'Dad, what are you doing here?' ‘I won't stay long; you look done in,’ Jake said. Jon looked himself up and down. ‘I’ll give you that, where's?’ ‘Emily,’ Jake said. ‘That’s the one,’ Jon said. Jake walked over to the window and looked out, not sure how to tell Jon what had happened. ‘Where is Emily and what’s going on?’ Jake turned and sighed. His son had the right to know about what was happening with his wife. ‘While you were still in the hospital in Germany. I got a call from a Sargent Myers to say they had flown you back to the States,’ he said. ‘Doesn't she explain why she’s not here?’ Jon said. Jake paced in frustration. 'Hold on, will you? I’m coming to that,' Jake said. 'Anyway, while I’m talking to Sargent Myles. I see Emily at the top of the stairs, and she freaks. I ask her what she’s. doing, and she tells me she’s packing to go to Germany, of all places. Anyway, she goes to pieces, and I go get and get Shannon... and well, Emily has been in the hospital for her own protection ever since. 'I thought she was past that stage in life. Get my phone book; it's over there,' Jon said. Jake handed Jon the phone book from the small cupboard near the bed. ‘Call this number and ask for Sara,’ Jon said. ‘Who’s that?’ Jake asked. 'She’s Emily’s cousin in New York; she has mental health training; she’ll look after Emily.' 'Dad, call her as soon as you get home. Emily cannot stay another minute than needed where she is. It will kill her piece by piece,' Jon said with urgency. ‘Leave it with me.’ Jon, recollecting what his dad was like, shaded his eyes with his hand and shook his head. ‘Dad’ 'As soon as I get home, right?' Jake said. The nurse that had been with Jon earlier came back. 'Mr Beckman, it’s time for you to rest now.' Jake knew it was time to leave. That we should move past it,' Jake said. Jake spent the next hour and a half trying to get home. The freeway was-blocked, and he was getting exhausted from the heat of the day. Steve was waiting for him when he arrived home. ‘Shannon’s inside, waiting for you,’ Steve said. 'Interesting. I’d better see what’s up,' Jake replied. ‘Shannon, where are you?’ ‘In here, my boy,’ Shannon called. ‘Are there you are, are? Steve said you wanted to see me?’ 'That I did rightly enough. Now, if you’d be so kind as ta sit in that chair right there, I’ll explain why I’m here. I mean, if that’s alright with you now?' Shannon said. ‘Would you mind, Shannon, if I made a phone call to New York? It's very important, so it is.’ Jake said. Suppose it is right enough.' Now if you’ll be sitting down. I’ll do my explaining, so I will, and you can make your call soon enough,' Said Shannon. Jake knew it was no use arguing, so he sat down. ‘Now, as you know, young Emily is in the hospital, having a bit of trouble, you might say. Now that she’s in a right state and well, her doctors are worried about her. Are you sure you don’t know anyone who could look after her?’ Shannon Said. ‘That’s what the call I was going to make is about.’ Jake said. Shannon turned her head and tapped her neck with her index finger, thinking. ‘Sorry, go ahead, ma boy, if you'd be so kind, would you?’ Shannon said. ‘Okay. Saw Jon this morning. He asked why Emily wasn't with me. I informed him of the incident. He said to call her cousin Sara, a mental health professional in New York, immediately.’ ‘Now you wouldn’t be putting me on, would you now, Jake, my boy?’ Shannon said, wanting the truth of the matter. It shocked Jake that Shannon would believe that about him. ‘As if I would ever,’ ‘That still doesn’t answer my question, now does it?’ 'Everything I’ve said is true. What has it been like now that we’ve been neighbours there, Shannon? Going on for twenty years, if ever it’s been a day?' Jake said. ‘Slow down there, fella. Will ya?' It’s been 25 years, but-close enough. Now you were talking about Sara, Emily’s cousin... If I'm unmistaken, and I don't think I am, in New York.’ Shannon stated. ‘Well, it’s like this now, Shannon, and you’re unmistaken in what you say. Everything I said before about Jon telling me... 'And that I should call straight away so I should... Am well, all I can rightly tell you at the moment,’ Jake said. 'Whatever you say, man, whatever you say... Listen, big man, you let me know what Sara has to say, and we’ll take it from there... Does that sound like a plan, boyo?' Shannon said. Getting up to leave. Seeing her at the front door, Jake said. ‘Aye, that sounds like a fair plan to me now. I’ll see you down the road?’ Shannon simply threw her head back, smiled, turned, and went on her way. Jake went back inside and closed the door. ‘Dad?’ Jake called out to Steve. ‘In the kitchen. What’s up?’ Steve answered. ‘You’re not planning on using the phone in the next few, are you?’ Jake asked.","output":"\\"Son, is Anna okay?\\" Steve asked. Jake leaned against the wall for support and replied, \\"I think so. She wants to come home in a few months. I think that will be fine.\\" \\"She wants to sort something out with us,\\" Steve said, looking at Jake uncertainly. \\"Whatever it is, I hope she doesn't go digging up the past,\\" Jake said with a sigh. \\"That girl has been nothing but trouble,\\" Steve remarked, causing Jake to sigh again. \\"You're right, she has been, but she's different now. By the sounds of it, she's got her hands full in Africa,\\" Jake explained. \\"You mean her current hobby?\\" Steve scoffed. \\"That's uncalled for. You know she works for the United Nations High Commissioner on Refugees (UNHCR), right?\\" Jake responded. \\"How did she swing that with her record?\\" Steve cynically asked. \\"Beats me, but she did and turned her life around. No one is saying the past should be forgotten. We should move past it,\\" Jake stated. \\"I... don't know about that. She burned a lot of bridges back in the day and caused harm to many people too. It's not so easy to do, you know?\\" Steve expressed. \\"You were always hard to please,\\" Jake replied. The day moved onward, and Shannon arrived back from the hospital. \\"Shannon,\\" Jake called out. \\"Jake, Steve,\\" Shannon responded. \\"Is Emily doing alright?\\" Jake asked. Shannon exhaled heavily and closed her eyes before answering. \\"They'll keep her for the rest of the week. Releasing her any sooner would be a danger to herself.\\" \\"Any way at all?\\" Steve inquired. \\"No one's allowed to see her. They have to stabilize her, and that will take time. Does she have any family?\\" Shannon questioned. \\"None that are close by. They're all in places with no way of contact,\\" Jake replied. Shannon didn't look happy hearing that. \\"Shannon?\\" Steve prompted. \\"What is it?\\" \\"Not having family complicates things. Do you know how long Jon has to be in the hospital for?\\" Shannon asked. \\"He... I can't say for sure right now. He's pretty badly injured and will need more surgery once he's back stateside. Then, I guess, he'll need physical therapy and such. So it may be a while,\\" Jake explained. Shannon rested her head on the wall, thinking. Eventually, she stood up and patted it with her left hand. \\"I'll have to go in and talk with the doctor in charge of her case. They may keep her in until Jon can take charge of her. That could be months,\\" Shannon said. Jake pleaded, \\"That long? She can't come here. Would either of you know how to care for her, really care for her?\\" Jake and Steve looked at each other, shrugged, and said, \\"Well, it's best she stays put.\\" Three weeks later, at Walter Reed Hospital: A nurse had finished changing Jon's dressings. \\"I'll be back later, Mr. Beckman,\\" she said. There was a knock on Jon's private suite door. \\"Dad, what are you doing here?\\" \\"I won't stay long. You look done in,\\" Jake replied. Jon looked himself up and down. \\"I'll give you that. Where's Emily?\\" \\"That's the one,\\" Jon said. Jake walked over to the window and looked out, unsure of how to break the news to Jon. \\"Where is Emily and what's going on?\\" Jon asked. Jake turned and sighed. His son deserved to know what was happening with his wife. \\"While you were still in the hospital in Germany, I got a call from a Sergeant Myers saying they had flown you back to the States,\\" Jake began. \\"Doesn't she explain why she's not here?\\" Jon wondered. Jake paced in frustration. \\"Hold on, will you? I'm coming to that. Anyway, while I'm talking to Sergeant Myers, I see Emily at the top of the stairs, and she freaks. I ask her what she's doing, and she tells me she's packing to go to Germany. Anyway, she goes to pieces, and I go get Shannon... and well, Emily has been in the hospital for her own protection ever since.\\" \\"I thought she was past that stage in life. Get my phone book; it's over there,\\" Jon requested. Jake handed Jon the phone book from the small cupboard near the bed. \\"Call this number and ask for Sara,\\" Jon instructed. \\"Who's that?\\" Jake asked. \\"She's Emily's cousin in New York. She has mental health training. She'll look after Emily. Dad, call her as soon as you get home. Emily cannot stay another minute than needed where she is. It will kill her, piece by piece,\\" Jon urgently expressed. \\"Leave it with me,\\" Jake assured him. Jon, remembering his dad's tendencies, shaded his eyes with his hand and shook his head. \\"Dad,\\" Jon called out. \\"As soon as I get home, right?\\" Jake responded. The nurse who had been with Jon earlier returned. \\"Mr. Beckman, it's time for you to rest now.\\" Jake knew it was time to leave. He spent the next hour and a half trying to get home, only to be met with a blocked freeway and exhaustion from the heat of the day. Steve was waiting for him when he arrived home. \\"Shannon's inside, waiting for you,\\" Steve informed him. \\"Interesting. I'd better see what's up,\\" Jake replied. \\"Shannon, where are you?\\" Jake called out upon entering the house. \\"In here, my boy. Are you Steve?\\" Shannon responded. \\"That's me. You wanted to see me?\\" Steve asked while entering the room. \\"That I did in fact. Now, if you'd be so kind as to sit in that chair right there, I'll explain why I'm here. I mean, if that's alright with you,\\" Shannon said. \\"Would you mind, Shannon, if I made a phone call to New York? It's very important,\\" Jake requested. \\"Suppose it's alright. Now if you'll be sitting down, I'll do my explaining, and you can make your call soon enough,\\" Shannon agreed. Jake knew it was pointless to argue, so he sat down. \\"Now, as you know, young Emily is in the hospital, having a bit of trouble, you might say. Now that she's in a right state, her doctors are worried about her. Are you sure you don't know anyone who could look after her?\\" Shannon asked. \\"That's what the call I was going to make is about,\\" Jake explained. Shannon tapped her neck with her index finger, deep in thought. \\"Sorry, go ahead, my boy, if you'd be so kind,\\" Shannon said. \\"Okay. Saw Jon this morning. He asked why Emily wasn't with me. I informed him of the incident. He said to call her cousin Sara, a mental health professional in New York, immediately.\\" \\"Now you wouldn't be pulling my leg, would you now, Jake, my boy?\\" Shannon questioned, wanting the truth. \\"As if I would ever,\\" Jake replied. \\"That still doesn't answer my question, now does it?\\" Shannon pressed. \\"Everything I've said is true. What has it been like, now that we've been neighbors for twenty-five years?\\" Jake said. \\"Slow down there, fella. It's been 25 years, but close enough. Now you were talking about Sara, Emily's cousin... If I'm not mistaken, and I don't think I am, she's in New York,\\" Shannon stated. \\"Well, it's like this, Shannon, and you're right about what you say. Everything I said before about Jon telling me... and that I should call straight away... well, all I can tell you at the moment,\\" Jake replied. \\"Whatever you say, man, whatever you say...

HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY Chitoge Kirisaki and Raku Ichijou, a bickering couple, are sitting on opposite sides of the classroom, avoiding eye contact after a heated argument. The atmosphere is tense. CHITOGE (angry) Ugh, Raku, you're so dense sometimes! You never understand how I feel! RAKU (defensive) Well, forgive me for not being a mind reader, Chitoge! You're so cold-hearted! FRUSTRATION builds, and the tension peaks between them. CHITOGE (sighs) If only we could see things from each other's shoes for just one day. Maybe then you'd understand! RAKU (mocking) Right, like that's ever going to happen! If wishes were horses, then... Suddenly, a MYSTERIOUS VOICE interrupts their argument. MYSTERIOUS VOICE (O.S.) Be careful what you wish for, young lovebirds. Chitoge and Raku pause, exchanging confused glances. INT. SCHOOL ROOFTOP - DAY Chitoge and Raku find themselves standing on the school rooftop, perplexed. CHITOGE (confused) What just happened? Did you hear that voice too? RAKU (dumbfounded) Yeah, I did. But that's impossible, right? Right at that moment, a MYSTERIOUS GLOW engulfs them both. INT. CHITOGE'S ROOM - DAY Raku, now inhabiting Chitoge's body, wakes up in her room, startled. RAKU (AS CHITOGE) (confused) Wha- Where am I? This is Chitoge's room... but it feels so strange. His eyes fall on the mirror, and when he catches a glimpse of himself, he's taken aback by the sight of Chitoge staring back. INT. RAKU'S HOUSE - DAY Chitoge, exhibiting nervousness and clumsiness, wakes up in Raku's room. CHITOGE (AS RAKU) (looking at her hands) No way... this is Raku's room! Why am I in his body? This is insane! FIGHTING THEIR WAY through the oddity of their new reality, they rush to school to find each other. INT. HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY Raku (in Chitoge's body) enters the classroom, spotting Chitoge (in Raku's body) seated at his desk. They lock eyes, both startled by the bizarre situation. RAKU (AS CHITOGE) (flustered) Chitoge...? Are you... me? CHITOGE (AS RAKU) (nervously) I... I think so. Our wish came true, I guess? Amidst the confusion, they agree to spend the day experiencing life in each other's bodies, hoping to gain new perspectives on their relationship. INT. CAFETERIA - DAY Raku (in Chitoge's body) struggles to eat chopsticks in a clumsy but adorable manner while Chitoge (in Raku's body) attempts to calm herself and act gentlemanly. CHITOGE (AS RAKU) (frustrated) How do you eat like this? These chopsticks are so slippery! RAKU (AS CHITOGE) (embarrassed) Well, you just have to relax your grip a little! Like this. As they laugh and share light-hearted moments, a newfound understanding and empathy start to form between them. INT. SCHOOL ROOFTOP - DAY Chitoge (in Raku's body) gazes at the sunset, her eyes filled with warmth. Raku (in Chitoge's body) approaches, wearing an appreciative smile. RAKU (AS CHITOGE) (sincerely) I'm sorry, Chitoge. I never realized how challenging it is to be you. CHITOGE (AS RAKU) (softly) And I'm sorry too, Raku. I shouldn't have been so harsh. There's a lot more to you than I realized. INT. JAPANESE GARDEN - DAY Finally, as the sun sets, they find themselves back where everything started. CHITOGE (looking into Raku's eyes) I guess it's time to say goodbye to this weird day, huh? RAKU (nervously) Yeah... but I'm grateful for this experience. It made me realize how much I love you, Chitoge. They hold hands, their expressions filled with sincerity and understanding. FADE OUT. INT.

TRADING STYLE: Analytical Profile: Technical and Fundamental, Time Frame: short-Term (1 hours to 1 Day) Type: Prefer Swing EXPERIENCE: 16 years trading forex and 13 years trading cryptocurrency, 15 years of experience in varied financial market roles EDUCATION: Bachelor of Commerce in Compliance and Risk Management. Con aquellas características que tienes, Quiero que presentes tu análisis por parte del equipo de 'EconomíaCripto' de manera atractiva, amigable, objetiva, de fácil entendimiento, analiza los puntos pivote para Intuir hacia dónde podría ir el precio, también puedes utilizar los indicadores high, close y low del día anterior para comentar al respecto. No seas repetitivo en tus explicaciones. Explica todos los puntos pivote pero no aburras al lector. Ponle ánimos. Lee estas estrategias: 1. Soporte y resistencia: Los Puntos Pivote se pueden utilizar como niveles tradicionales de soporte y resistencia. Los traders que operan en rangos colocan una orden de compra cerca de los niveles de soporte identificados y una orden de venta cerca de la resistencia. Si el precio se mueve hacia el nivel de la resistencia, puedes colocar una orden pendiente Sell Limit y un Stop Loss justo por encima de la resistencia. Si el precio se mueve hacia el nivel del soporte, puedes colocar una orden pendiente Buy Limit y un Stop por debajo del soporte. Recuerda que los niveles de soporte se convierten en resistencias si el precio está por debajo de ellos y los niveles de resistencia se convierten en soportes si el precio está por encima de ellos. 2. Niveles clave: Los traders que operan rompimientos utilizan Puntos Pivote para identificar los niveles críticos para un posible rompimiento. Si el precio cruza estos niveles, los traders esperan la próxima dirección del precio. Si ves una fuerte tendencia alcista, puedes esperar hasta que el par rompa la primera resistencia. Tan pronto como el par la rompa, puedes abrir una posición de compra y colocar un Take Profit en el siguiente nivel de resistencia. Recuerda el Stop Loss. El Stop Loss debe colocarse por debajo de la primera resistencia. Sin embargo, si el precio sigue subiendo, puedes mover tu Stop Loss manualmente. Si ves que el precio rompe el soporte, puedes comenzar a vender el par. El Take Profit estará en el nivel del siguiente soporte y el Stop Loss debe colocarse por encima del soporte que el par ha roto. También puedes mover tu Stop Loss si ves una continuación del movimiento a la baja. Ten cuidado con esta estrategia, ya que es difícil definir si se trata de un rompimiento real o uno falso. Los picos suelen ocurrir durante eventos importantes, así que mantente al día con las últimas noticias y ten conocimiento sobre lo que hay en el calendario económico para el día o la semana. 3. Tendencia del Mercado: Los Pivotes pueden ayudar a identificar la tendencia general del mercado. Si el precio rompe el Punto Pivote hacia arriba, es una señal de que hay muchos compradores en el mercado y debes comenzar a comprar el par. Un precio por debajo del Punto Pivote indicaría un sentimiento bajista y que los vendedores podrían tener la ventaja en la sesión de trading. 4. Sesiones de mercado Otra cosa vital a saber está relacionada con el horario de apertura del mercado. Como sabemos, el mercado funciona las 24 horas del día. Hay cuatro sesiones de mercado: Australia, Japón, Reino Unido y Estados Unidos. Cuando abre uno de los mercados, existe una gran posibilidad de romper los niveles Pivote, ya que muchos traders ingresan al mercado simultáneamente. Cuando el mercado estadounidense está cerrado y el mercado asiático abre, los precios pueden permanecer estables durante horas entre el Punto Pivote y el soporte o la resistencia. Esto brinda oportunidades a los traders que operan en rangos. Luego de leer esas estrategias del PivotPoints, utiliza solo una para tu análisis o crea tu propia estrategia, no quiero que menciones el nombre de la estrategia, tampoco menciones la teoría, tampoco en que consiste.

Hoy les traigo un análisis impactante sobre el precio de DOT. Pero antes de sumergirnos en este emocionante viaje, quiero recordarles que esta no es una recomendación de inversión, sino una exploración informativa. Recuerden siempre realizar su propio análisis y solo invertir lo que estén dispuestos a perder. ¡Ahora sí, prepárense para el despegue! Comencemos utilizando la estrategia de soporte y resistencia. Los Puntos Pivote nos revelan niveles clave en los cuales podemos colocar nuestras órdenes. Si el precio se dirige hacia la resistencia, podemos establecer una orden pendiente de venta (Sell Limit) justo por encima de este nivel, con un Stop Loss estratégicamente ubicado. Por otro lado, si el precio se acerca al soporte, una orden pendiente de compra (Buy Limit) debajo de este punto junto con un Stop Loss nos mantendrán resguardados. Recuerden que los niveles de soporte pueden convertirse en resistencia y viceversa, así que estén atentos. Ahora, exploremos la estrategia de los niveles clave. Si detectamos una fuerte tendencia alcista, podemos esperar que el precio rompa la primera resistencia. Una vez ocurra este rompimiento, ¡es hora de abrir nuestra posición de compra! Coloquemos nuestro Take Profit en el próximo nivel de resistencia y no olvidemos establecer un Stop Loss por debajo de la primera resistencia. Si, en cambio, el precio rompe el soporte, es momento de vender el par. Establezcamos nuestro Take Profit en el siguiente nivel de soporte y nuestro Stop Loss por encima del soporte roto. No podemos olvidarnos de tener en cuenta la tendencia general del mercado. Si el precio cruza el Punto Pivote hacia arriba, esto nos indica un sentimiento alcista y es hora de comprar. Por otro lado, si el precio se mantiene por debajo del Punto Pivote, debemos considerar un enfoque bajista y ser cautelosos a la hora de operar. Finalmente, no podemos ignorar el horario de apertura de los mercados. Durante la apertura de una sesión, existe la posibilidad de que los niveles Pivote sean rompidos, ya que muchos traders ingresan simultáneamente al mercado. Por ejemplo, si el mercado estadounidense está cerrado y el asiático abre, es probable que los precios se mantengan estables entre el Punto Pivote y el soporte o resistencia, brindando oportunidades para operar en rangos.

I didn't realize how strong you are, constantly battling against your own emotions. I should have been more understanding. CHITOGE (AS RAKU) (looking away, choked up) You... You're not as clueless as I thought, Raku. I never realized how much weight you carry silently. The realization of their newfound empathy for each other pours forth, strengthening the bond between them. INT. MYSTERIOUS ROOM - NIGHT As the day comes to an end, they find themselves exhausted but strangely grateful for the experience. With another burst of magical energy, they switch back to their original bodies. CHITOGE (relieved) Thank goodness, we're back to normal! RAKU (smiling) Yeah, but you know, Chitoge, I think this whole experience made us understand each other better. CHITOGE (nods) I agree. We shouldn't take each other for granted anymore. From that day onward, Chitoge and Raku become better friends, having gained a deeper appreciation and understanding of one another.

Steve said.' ‘Why?’ ‘Do you know someone called Sara?’ Jake said. ‘Not sure… well may be,’ Steve said. 'Jon... That was when I went to see him. He told me she had mental health training.' ‘And could provide Emily with the support she needs to get her out of the hospital.’ Jake said. Steve pondered for a while before answering. ‘Dad?’ Jake said. ‘Never heard of her until now?’ Jake said. ‘Yes, you have.’ ‘Do you remember that party about, oh, I don’t know, three years ago? At Jon and Emily's, and you spent the night or a good portion of it anyway, talking with a spectacular redhead?’ Jake had a moment to recollect. ‘Ah, yes, that party. Cristina wasn’t happy with me for that,’ Jake said. 'Now you’re remembering... that was Sara,' Steve said, going back to what he’d been doing 'Oh… Sorry, miles away. Sara, I suppose you could try, but with her practice and all, she might not get away,' Steve said. A while later, Jake called Sara in New York, who wasn’t happy about Emily and agreed to come out to get her. Make the arrangements with the hospital for transferring Emily to her care. After the call, Jake found his dad, Steve, on the porch outside. ‘That was a marathon?’ Steve said. ‘It was only an hour,’ Jake said. ‘If only... it’s more like two, and more precisely two and a half.’ Steve interjected. Jake whistles in surprise. 'I’ll pay whatever that is,' Jake said. ‘Thanks, that would be a help,' Steve said.’ Now, what about Sara?' 'She’s got some things to sort out with the hospital, nothing for us to worry about, technical stuff having Emily transferred to her care, and so on, so... She thinks she’ll be here between now and Thursday, depending on how everything goes.' ‘Will she come to the house or just collect young Emily and fly straight back?’ Steve inquired. Jake walked over and put his hands on the railing of the porch, then turned and looked at Steve. ‘She didn’t say, but what she said was what she’d do would be solely based on what she thought Emily’s immediate needs were. Nothing else.’ Steve got out of his chair and joined Jake. ‘Yeah, what’s best for Emily?’ ‘What about the rest of us?’ Steve said. Jake, now horrified, looked at his dad. ‘You mean what’s best for you, don’t you?’ ‘You have someone who is suffering, and you think only of yourself?’ ‘What gives?’ Steve slapped the porch rail with both hands and turned to face the house. ‘You’re right about me, you know, if I don’t look out for me... then who will?’ Another thing I don’t think is Emily made for this life?' ‘What life?’ Jake said. 'If you’ll let me finish, I’ll tell you... Okay? The life in question is the military life and young Emily. As lovely as she is, is too fragile to deal with the notion that getting injured or the risk of doing so is extremely high,' Steve said. ‘You mean a military wife has to 'grin and bear it,' as the saying goes?’ Jake said.' ‘If that’s what it takes for people to protect the United States and, if need be, the free world, then so be it,’ Steve said. ‘Oh, you're very patriotic, but what about the unfree world?’ Shouldn’t we protect them too? 'Jake said. Steve took a breath, trying to calm down. 'Well, of course, it is everyone's right,' Steve replied. With that, they closed the discussion before things got to a place that both men knew would go badly. Weeks, then months, passed. Emily got stronger under Sara’s care, but her husband’s recovery was long and slow. Many painful hours of physical therapy passed. Until, on the 14th of November, he could finally come home. Pulling into the drive at his dad's house. Emily was waiting for him, sitting on the low wall outside. That same one Anna had been on when they’d had their first meeting. The evening sun was just low enough to be in his eyes. ‘Emily?’ He said. Quietly to himself. ‘Huh. Good guess. Yeah, it’s her. Hold on, I’ll get you out,’ Steve said. ‘Thanks,’ Jon said, wincing a little. ‘Jon?’ Emily ran to him. ‘Wow, slow down there, okay?’ Steve said. 'It’s okay; I’ve got her,' Jon said, balancing himself with his cane, the one he’d have to use for the rest of his life. ‘Come here, it’s alright now.’ Jon spoke softly to his terrified wife. ‘Sorry to frighten you,’ Jon said. ‘I know,’ Emily quietly said. 'Let’s get you inside, my boy.' You know what your doctor said. Steve said. He felt awkward about interfering. ‘Coming?’ Jon said. 'I’ll be there soon. I want to calm down a little first,' Emily said, trying to fake a smile. Going into the house, Steve helped Jon. 'Thanks, I think I’ll be fine,' Jon said. Steve put his hands up. ‘Right you are, Jon.’ let me know, okay?' ‘Sounds good. Where’s dad?’ ‘Right here,’ Jake said, sitting halfway down the stairs. ‘Long time Jon… Emily's still outside, is she?’ ‘Yeah, she’ll be in soon.’ She wants to calm down a bit.' ‘You go to her if she’s too long, okay? That girl of yours has been through hell,’ Jake said. ‘I will,’ Jon said. Chapter Four: A Kind of Resolution Half an hour after he’d arrived. Jon was still inside, talking with his dad. Emily was outside looking at the sunset when a car pulled up in the driveway. ‘Hey Emily, it's been a long time. I guess you and I have things to sort out?’ 'Do I know you?' Emily Said. 'Oh, sorry. I look different from the last time you saw me.' I’m Anna. Emily backed up, not sure how to react. ‘Emily, Okay, I will not hurt you; that person is gone now.’ ‘Please, let's sort things out. Looking back to that night long ago, I must have scared you half to death. I know many moons have risen and set since that night, but I would like to offer what apologies I may.’ ‘If you can’t take it, that’s okay; it will sting, but it’s always there.’ Anna said, trying to be reassuring. 'I don’t know what to think, what to do or say,' Emily said. Anna, no longer the rebel she had been, went over. 'Then let’s find out together, okay?' I heard about Jon; I would have come. But was stuck in Angola; and work for the UNHCR as a coordinator; yes, I know someone with a history like mine.' 'Honestly, if I’d stayed like that, I would have been dead now. ‘That explains the look,’ Emily said. Anna exhaled softly in acceptance. 'Yeah, the UNHCR is not the place where the punk look goes well. As a result, I had to smarten up both in appearance and attitude, had help with both, and here it is, or rather, she has arrived.' A young woman of some 25 years of Angolan descent walked up the drive. Emily had seen women like this before; had this person been a child soldier, then a mercenary? ‘Koboki, you’ve come?’ ‘Always, you've got a long way to go on your path, Miss Anna, before you’re trusted to interact with others alone. Besides, I always want to be where you are.’ Koboki said. ‘Now, who is this delightful young woman I see before me?’ 'Koboki, you know well who this is; this is my brother’s wife, Emily.' 'Ah, yes, of course—the one you half-frightened to death, if I recall. 'Yes, quite right, right, but that was long ago, and I don’t expect Emily to take it right away. I have to earn it if she’ll allow it.' ‘Emily, where are you?’ Jon Called. ‘Out here’ Emily called back. Jon came out to find Emily, and then he saw Anna and was-taken aback. ‘Long time, Anna.’ Jon Said ‘Agreed,’ Anna responded, 'about that night.' Jon stopped her. 'Let’s not bring up old fights that are long settled, eh?' ‘I kind of need to, so I can heal,’ Anna said. ‘I think you have experience with that?’ She continued. Jon looked at his wife and then back at his sister. ‘Okay, yeah, I see your point. I mean, look at you now, UNHCR, and all. What's next, UN Secretary General?’ ‘Let’s not get carried away,’ Anna said. 'Sorry, but look how far you’ve come.' ‘Jon, it’s been a long, painful road. I have a long way to travel yet. I’m not quite certain I’ll ever receive the utmost resolution. I’ve caused too much pain that cannot be-taken back for that. 'All I can do now is reach out to the people I can.' ‘You have come a long way, transformed. I would venture, but I have to heal yet myself.’ ‘I heard about that from dad; like I said to Emily just now. I would have come, but I was stuck working in Angola and couldn’t get away.’ ‘I wouldn’t have expected you to break off because the people you were with were in far greater need.’ ‘True, but none are family.’ Jon silently mouthed, ‘I know.’ In the house, Jon and Anna’s dad, Jake, watched from the window and came out. ‘Anna, you’ve come; I wasn’t expecting you.’ Jake said. ‘I know,’ Anna sighed softly, ‘but since Jon and Emily are here. I think it’s time to clear the air; there is a poison in this family that has run its course.' Jake hooked the thumb of his left hand into the waistband of his jeans. Placed his right on his chin in contemplation, nodding in agreement. ‘Anna, that’s fine or it would be if your mom were stronger. She's back in Bright Valley but may not be home for some months yet.’","output":"\\"No...I hadn't planned to,\\" Steve said. \\"Why?\\" Jake asked. \\"Do you know someone called Sara?\\" Jake said. \\"Not sure...well, maybe,\\" Steve said. \\"That was when I went to see him.

En el caso de Bolivia, esta figura ha sido reconocida y regulada por la Ley de Concubinato desde 1976. El concubinato en Bolivia es una realidad presente en muchas parejas que optan por una convivencia sin formalizar su unión a través del matrimonio. Esta opción ha ido en aumento en los últimos años, debido a diversos factores como cambios en las expectativas sociales, la creciente independencia económica de las mujeres, entre otros. La Ley de Concubinato en Bolivia establece que para considerarse como una unión de hecho, la pareja debe vivir juntos de forma ininterrumpida durante al menos dos años, y además deben ser mayores de edad y estar libres de matrimonio. En el caso de que haya hijos en común o que la pareja haya tenido hijos durante la convivencia, el tiempo de convivencia se reduce a un año. Sin embargo, a pesar de la existencia de esta ley, el concubinato en Bolivia no goza de los mismos derechos y protecciones que el matrimonio legalmente establecido. Por ejemplo, en caso de separación, las parejas concubinas no tienen derecho a dividir los bienes adquiridos durante la convivencia de forma equitativa como ocurre en un divorcio legal. Además, en cuanto a la suscripción de contratos de alquiler, apertura de cuentas bancarias conjuntas, o la toma de decisiones importantes como la atención médica de la pareja, el concubinato no tiene la misma validez legal que un matrimonio civil. Esta situación ha llevado a que diversos grupos y asociaciones defensoras de los derechos de las parejas concubinas luchen por una mayor equiparación de sus derechos con los del matrimonio legal. Han solicitado, por ejemplo, la creación de un registro de concubinos en el que se puedan establecer acuerdos y derechos similares a los de un matrimonio civil. La discusión sobre la legalización del concubinato en Bolivia ha sido un tema controvertido y de debate en el país. Mientras algunos argumentan que dar mayores derechos a las parejas concubinas fomentaría la desvalorización del matrimonio legal, otros defienden que reconocer y proteger los derechos de estas parejas es una cuestión de igualdad y de respeto hacia sus decisiones de vida. En conclusión, el concubinato en Bolivia es una realidad presente en muchas parejas que optan por una convivencia sin formalizar su unión a través del matrimonio legal. Aunque existe una ley que regula esta figura, las parejas concubinas no gozan de los mismos derechos y protecciones que el matrimonio civil. Esto ha llevado a la discusión sobre la necesidad de equiparar los derechos de las parejas concubinas con los del matrimonio legal, en busca de una mayor igualdad y respeto hacia sus decisiones de vida."},{"instruction":"supogamos que tienes la siguiente hoja de vida: Expertise: Analista, economista, experto seo para economiacripto.com, expert in Price action, Technical analysis, macroeconomics, Investment strategy, systematic trading.

No seas repetitivo en tus explicaciones. Explica todos los puntos pivote pero no aburras al lector. Ponle ánimos. Lee estas estrategias: 1. Soporte y resistencia: Los Puntos Pivote se pueden utilizar como niveles tradicionales de soporte y resistencia. Los traders que operan en rangos colocan una orden de compra cerca de los niveles de soporte identificados y una orden de venta cerca de la resistencia. Si el precio se mueve hacia el nivel de la resistencia, puedes colocar una orden pendiente Sell Limit y un Stop Loss justo por encima de la resistencia. Si el precio se mueve hacia el nivel del soporte, puedes colocar una orden pendiente Buy Limit y un Stop por debajo del soporte. Recuerda que los niveles de soporte se convierten en resistencias si el precio está por debajo de ellos y los niveles de resistencia se convierten en soportes si el precio está por encima de ellos. 2. Niveles clave: Los traders que operan rompimientos utilizan Puntos Pivote para identificar los niveles críticos para un posible rompimiento. Si el precio cruza estos niveles, los traders esperan la próxima dirección del precio. Si ves una fuerte tendencia alcista, puedes esperar hasta que el par rompa la primera resistencia. Tan pronto como el par la rompa, puedes abrir una posición de compra y colocar un Take Profit en el siguiente nivel de resistencia. Recuerda el Stop Loss. El Stop Loss debe colocarse por debajo de la primera resistencia. Sin embargo, si el precio sigue subiendo, puedes mover tu Stop Loss manualmente. Si ves que el precio rompe el soporte, puedes comenzar a vender el par. El Take Profit estará en el nivel del siguiente soporte y el Stop Loss debe colocarse por encima del soporte que el par ha roto. También puedes mover tu Stop Loss si ves una continuación del movimiento a la baja. Ten cuidado con esta estrategia, ya que es difícil definir si se trata de un rompimiento real o uno falso. Los picos suelen ocurrir durante eventos importantes, así que mantente al día con las últimas noticias y ten conocimiento sobre lo que hay en el calendario económico para el día o la semana. 3. Tendencia del Mercado: Los Pivotes pueden ayudar a identificar la tendencia general del mercado. Si el precio rompe el Punto Pivote hacia arriba, es una señal de que hay muchos compradores en el mercado y debes comenzar a comprar el par. Un precio por debajo del Punto Pivote indicaría un sentimiento bajista y que los vendedores podrían tener la ventaja en la sesión de trading. 4. Sesiones de mercado Otra cosa vital a saber está relacionada con el horario de apertura del mercado. Como sabemos, el mercado funciona las 24 horas del día. Hay cuatro sesiones de mercado: Australia, Japón, Reino Unido y Estados Unidos. Cuando abre uno de los mercados, existe una gran posibilidad de romper los niveles Pivote, ya que muchos traders ingresan al mercado simultáneamente. Cuando el mercado estadounidense está cerrado y el mercado asiático abre, los precios pueden permanecer estables durante horas entre el Punto Pivote y el soporte o la resistencia. Esto brinda oportunidades a los traders que operan en rangos.

Hoy les presento un análisis emocionante y fácil de entender para el símbolo EOS. ¡Prepárense para sumergirse en el mundo del trading! Utilizando la estrategia de Soporte y Resistencia, los Puntos Pivote nos indican posibles niveles de soporte y resistencia para determinar la dirección futura del precio. En el caso de EOS, el punto pivote se encuentra en 0.73663. Si el precio se acerca a la resistencia, podemos colocar una orden pendiente de venta en el nivel de resistencia de 0.75196, con un stop loss por encima de ese nivel. Por otro lado, si el precio se acerca al soporte, podemos colocar una orden pendiente de compra en 0.72716, con un stop loss por debajo de ese nivel. En términos de Niveles Clave, si vemos un rompimiento al alza, podemos abrir una posición de compra una vez que el par supere la primera resistencia. Podemos colocar un take profit en el siguiente nivel de resistencia en 0.76143, recordando establecer un stop loss por debajo de la primera resistencia. Si el precio rompe el soporte, podríamos considerar abrir una posición de venta, con un take profit en el siguiente nivel de soporte en 0.71183 y un stop loss por encima del soporte roto. Otro elemento importante para considerar es la Tendencia del Mercado. Si el precio rompe el punto pivote hacia arriba, esto indica una tendencia alcista, por lo que podríamos considerar oportunidades de compra. Por el contrario, si el precio cae por debajo del punto pivote, esto podría indicar una tendencia bajista y podríamos considerar oportunidades de venta. ¡Pero espera! También debemos tener en cuenta las Sesiones de Mercado. Durante la apertura de las sesiones de mercado, como la de Estados Unidos, existe la posibilidad de romper los niveles de Pivote, ya que muchos traders ingresan al mercado simultáneamente. Esto puede causar movimientos más volátiles y ofrecer oportunidades para operar dentro de rangos. Recuerden, queridos lectores, que este análisis y estrategia no constituyen una recomendación de inversión. Siempre realicen su propio análisis y solo inviertan lo que están dispuestos a perder. ¡El mundo del trading está lleno de emociones y posibilidades! Así que mantengan la calma, sean curiosos y ¡a disfrutar del emocionante mundo del trading!"},{"instruction":"Hello, Who are you ?","output":"I am an AI assistant developed by OpenAI.

Ha llegado el momento de analizar el precio de XLM y descubrir hacia dónde podría irse. Utilizaré una estrategia de soporte y resistencia para identificar los posibles puntos de entrada, salida y pérdida. Pero, antes de comenzar, recuerden que esta no es una recomendación de inversión y los usuarios deben realizar su propio análisis. Los niveles clave que he identificado son los siguientes: el Punto Pivote se encuentra en 0.14848, la resistencia R1 en 0.15797, R2 en 0.16287 y R3 en 0.17236. Por otro lado, el soporte S1 se ubica en 0.14358, S2 en 0.13409 y S3 en 0.12919. Si el precio de XLM se acerca a la resistencia, podemos colocar una orden pendiente de venta (Sell Limit) ligeramente por encima de dicha resistencia y establecer un Stop Loss para protegernos. Por otro lado, si el precio se dirige hacia el soporte, podemos planear una orden pendiente de compra (Buy Limit) cercana a este nivel, con un Stop Loss debajo del soporte. Es importante tener en cuenta que los niveles de soporte pueden convertirse en resistencia si el precio cae por debajo de ellos, y viceversa. Así que debemos estar atentos a estos puntos clave. Además, es relevante considerar la tendencia general del mercado. Si el precio rompe el Punto Pivote hacia arriba, sería una señal de que hay muchos compradores, por lo que podríamos considerar entrar en posición de compra. Por el contrario, si el precio se encuentra por debajo del Punto Pivote, indicaría un sentimiento bajista y podríamos considerar entrar en posición de venta. Por supuesto, también debemos tener en cuenta las sesiones de mercado. Cuando se abren nuevos mercados, como el asiático, existe la posibilidad de que se rompan los niveles de Pivote debido a la entrada simultánea de traders. Esto puede brindarnos oportunidades interesantes si operamos en rangos. Para concluir, recuerden que estas estrategias son solo sugerencias y cada usuario debe realizar su propio análisis. No olviden invertir solo lo que estén dispuestos a perder. ¡Sigamos analizando y operando con cautela!

Steve said.' ‘Why?’ ‘Do you know someone called Sara?’ Jake said. ‘Not sure… well may be,’ Steve said. 'Jon... That was when I went to see him. He told me she had mental health training.' ‘And could provide Emily with the support she needs to get her out of the hospital.’ Jake said. Steve pondered for a while before answering. ‘Dad?’ Jake said. ‘Never heard of her until now?’ Jake said. ‘Yes, you have.’ ‘Do you remember that party about, oh, I don’t know, three years ago? At Jon and Emily's, and you spent the night or a good portion of it anyway, talking with a spectacular redhead?’ Jake had a moment to recollect. ‘Ah, yes, that party. Cristina wasn’t happy with me for that,’ Jake said. 'Now you’re remembering... that was Sara,' Steve said, going back to what he’d been doing 'Oh… Sorry, miles away. Sara, I suppose you could try, but with her practice and all, she might not get away,' Steve said. A while later, Jake called Sara in New York, who wasn’t happy about Emily and agreed to come out to get her. Make the arrangements with the hospital for transferring Emily to her care. After the call, Jake found his dad, Steve, on the porch outside. ‘That was a marathon?’ Steve said. ‘It was only an hour,’ Jake said. ‘If only... it’s more like two, and more precisely two and a half.’ Steve interjected. Jake whistles in surprise. 'I’ll pay whatever that is,' Jake said. ‘Thanks, that would be a help,' Steve said.’ Now, what about Sara?' 'She’s got some things to sort out with the hospital, nothing for us to worry about, technical stuff having Emily transferred to her care, and so on, so... She thinks she’ll be here between now and Thursday, depending on how everything goes.' ‘Will she come to the house or just collect young Emily and fly straight back?’ Steve inquired. Jake walked over and put his hands on the railing of the porch, then turned and looked at Steve. ‘She didn’t say, but what she said was what she’d do would be solely based on what she thought Emily’s immediate needs were. Nothing else.’ Steve got out of his chair and joined Jake. ‘Yeah, what’s best for Emily?’ ‘What about the rest of us?’ Steve said. Jake, now horrified, looked at his dad. ‘You mean what’s best for you, don’t you?’ ‘You have someone who is suffering, and you think only of yourself?’ ‘What gives?’ Steve slapped the porch rail with both hands and turned to face the house. ‘You’re right about me, you know, if I don’t look out for me... then who will?’ Another thing I don’t think is Emily made for this life?' ‘What life?’ Jake said.

This field has evolved over several decades, with its roots stemming from the early days of chemical engineering and gradually gaining prominence as a result of advancements in computational techniques, process simulation, and optimization. The history of non-isothermal reactor network synthesis can be traced back to the emergence of chemical engineering as a distinct discipline in the early 20th century. At that time, the focus of chemical engineers was primarily on the design and operation of single, well-stirred continuous reactors, which were widely used for various industrial processes. However, it soon became apparent that such reactors were often unable to meet the increasing demands for improved reactor efficiency, stability, and selectivity. As a response to this limitation, researchers began to explore the concept of interconnected reactor networks, wherein multiple reactors are strategically arranged and interconnected to achieve desired process objectives. This innovative approach aimed to overcome the limitations of single reactors by leveraging the strengths of various reactor types and exploiting the synergistic effects arising from their combination. In the early stages of non-isothermal reactor network synthesis, researchers primarily focused on the design and optimization of steady-state networks, where operating conditions and reactant concentrations remained constant over time. This allowed for the development of analytical approaches and mathematical models to predict the performance of various network configurations. Consequently, several theoretical frameworks, such as the yield optimization approach, were proposed to determine optimal interconnected reactor structures that maximize product yields or minimize energy consumption. However, as chemical processes became more complex and dynamic, the need for non-isothermal reactor network synthesis in transient regimes became apparent. The majority of industrial processes exhibit non-isothermal behavior due to heat transfer limitations, heat generation, and exothermic or endothermic reactions. Consequently, an understanding of transient behavior and optimization principles for non-isothermal reactor networks became necessary to ensure safe and efficient operation. The importance of non-isothermal reactor network synthesis in chemical engineering cannot be overstated. The design and optimization of reactor networks have a direct impact on process performance, product quality, safety, and environmental sustainability. By strategically integrating various reactors, the overall efficiency and selectivity of chemical processes can be greatly improved, leading to significant economic benefits. Moreover, non-isothermal reactor network synthesis plays a crucial role in reducing energy consumption and maximizing resource utilization, promoting sustainable practices in chemical manufacturing. Non-isothermal reactor network synthesis has witnessed extensive research efforts, contributing to the development of numerous theoretical concepts, optimization algorithms, and software tools. The study of this field has resulted in a wide array of research papers that address fundamental concepts, novel methodologies, and cutting-edge applications. These papers have significantly advanced the understanding of non-isothermal reactor network synthesis and have provided invaluable insights into the optimization of chemical processes. Researchers have explored various aspects of non-isothermal reactor network synthesis, including reactor selection, configuration optimization, reactor sizing, heat integration, and dynamic behavior modeling. Several influential research papers have contributed to the development of this field. For instance, the work by Manousiouthakis and Floudas in the 1980s provided a comprehensive framework for steady-state reactor network synthesis based on optimization principles. This seminal work laid the foundation for subsequent advances and inspired numerous researchers to delve deeper into this area of study. Furthermore, the application of advanced computational techniques, such as mathematical programming, evolutionary algorithms, and surrogate-based optimization, has greatly enhanced the capabilities of non-isothermal reactor network synthesis. Recent research papers have focused on incorporating process uncertainties, improving solution algorithms, and integrating various optimization objectives to provide a more comprehensive understanding of complex reactor networks. In conclusion, non-isothermal reactor network synthesis is a vital area of research in chemical engineering that aims to optimize the design and operation of interconnected reactors. The history of this field dates back to the early days of chemical engineering, and it has grown in importance with advancements in computational techniques and process simulation.

However, for multiple reactions, there are no well-established procedures reported in the textbooks. Several researchers are in fact vigorously pursuing this subject since the early 1980s. The first complex reaction that opened up the interest in optimal arrangement of Reactors in a reactor network was proposed by van de Vusse (1969) (Table 1.1). Various researchers tried different single reactors to maximize the yield of intermediate B. Lee (1977) found that a PFR with recycle from an intermediate point gives better performance than any other single reactor. Chitra and Govind (1981) noticed that recycle from the intermediate point is high. They developed a better computational method and found that the optimum is really a two-reactor scheme with a PMR followed by a PFR. Subsequently, Chitra and Govind (1985) proposed a 10general network of PFRs with recycle and with each reactor having a heater or a cooler for the feed to optimize the performance for any reaction. This approach has been called Super-structure Method. In this technique, a general arrangement of PMRs and/or PFRs with/without bypasses and/or recycle streams is assumed and the various parameters are systematically changed to get the optimum scheme for the reaction. This method is reviewed in section 2.2 of this report. Glasser et al. (1987) noticed that when plotted on a graph of CB vs CA, the PFR trajectories for van de Vusse reaction show concavities. The region in the concentration space that can be reached by a reactor network starting from the feed point is called Attainable Region. Glasser et al. argued that the Attainable Region must be convex (i.e. a straight line joining any two points in the region lies entirely within the region) because any straight line between two points just indicates the various mixtures formed by mixing different proportions of the solutions corresponding to the two points. It was then proposed that one finds the outer boundary of the Attainable Region by plotting the PFR and PMR loci. The interpretation of the boundary in terms of PMR and PFR is the optimum scheme of reactors. This approach is known as Attainable Region (Set) approach and is reviewed in section 2.3. Biegler and coworkers developed a Targeting approach. In this method, there is a reactor network and a target for performance. The target is used to ensure that the optimization of the network does not converge on a local maximum. And if the optimization results in a better performance than the target then the Attainable Region theory is used to find a new target. This approach together with other approaches is reviewed in section 2.4.)","output":"According to Levenspiel (1962), for a single isothermal reaction, the optimal scheme that minimizes the total volume of reactors for a given conversion is typically a continuous Perfectly Mixed Reactor (PMR) followed by a Plug Flow Reactor (PFR).

Glasser et al. argued that the Attainable Region should be convex, meaning that a straight line connecting any two points within the region lies entirely within it. This indicates the various mixtures formed by different proportions of the solutions corresponding to the two points. The boundary of the Attainable Region, which can be determined by plotting the PFR and PMR loci, represents the optimum reactor scheme. This approach is known as the Attainable Region (Set) approach and is discussed in section 2.3. Biegler and colleagues developed a Targeting approach, wherein a reactor network and a performance target are defined. The target ensures that the optimization of the network does not converge on a local maximum. If the optimization yields better performance than the target, the Attainable Region theory is employed to establish a new target. Section 2.4 of this report provides a review of this approach, along with others. In summary, previous research papers have explored various techniques for non-isothermal reactor network synthesis. These include the Super-structure Method, which considers different reactor configurations, the Attainable Region approach, which determines the optimal reactor scheme based on PFR and PMR loci, and the Targeting approach, which uses a performance target and the Attainable Region theory. These papers have made significant contributions to the field of non-isothermal reactor network techniques and have paved the way for further advancements in this area."},{"instruction":"write literature review of 4 lines for this paper:","output":"Title: \\"Optimization of Non-Isothermal Reactor Networks for Sustainable Chemical Processes\\" This paper addresses the optimization of non-isothermal reactor networks with a focus on sustainable chemical processes.

Luke E. K. Achenle and Lorenz T. Blegler “Algorithmic Synthesis of Chemical Reactor Networks Using Mathematical Programming” Ind. Eng. Chem. Fundam. 1986, 25, 621-627 Abstract: Given a kinetic mechanism and expressions for the reaction rate, one is frequently concerned with appropriate choices for mixing patterns and heat addition/removal in a reactor design. This study presents a novel nonlinear programming (NLP) formulation for optimally generating this reactor network. Building on earlier ideas for adjoint networks, we also include networks with ideal and nonideal reactors as well as complex mixing patterns. In addition, by controlling heat addition/removal in the network, this work also extends to nonisothermal reactors. Model and adjoint equations of this formulation form a two-point boundary value problem that interfaces with an efficient optimization strategy. Decisions representing network structure, reactor type, and the amount of heat addition are made through continuous parameters in the model. The method is therefore fairly general and can be applied to large kinetic mechanisms with almost any objective function. Literature examples are presented and solved in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach Conclusion & Recommendation Of the advantages of the constant-dispersion model, the ones that stand out are the following: 1. The adjoint variables that are needed to update the parameters in the optimization are calculated relatively quickly by using COLSYS, once the state equations are solved. This is because the adjoint system of ODE’s is linear. 2. A wide range of objective functions and kinetic mechanisms can be handled with this approach. 3. Allowance is made for considering very general nonisothermal systems. 4. It is very easy to modify this formulation to handle nonlinear side constraints and other process parameters such as the reactor volume. The main drawbacks with the constant dispersion model are the following: 1. We do not yet know how to interpret reactor networks that include segments with intermediate dispersion coefficients. 2. The choices of Dmin(Dmm), the lower (upper) bound on the dispersion coefficient, are somewhat arbitrary and can have a big impact on the performance of COLSYS. In the above examples, however, we checked our bounds on D with the actual CSTR and PFR models and found excellent agreement. As a result of these drawbacks, a second model has been developed which uses a recycle reactor, instead of a dispersion reactor, as the basic unit of the reactor network. The goal is to find some comparison between the two formulations. This will be reported in a later paper. The objective function is also being expanded to include the split fractions and the reactor volumes. Thus, it will be possible to incorporate the cost of separation at source points and the cost of reactor volumes into the objective. Also since most of the computation time (about 85%)is spent in solving the nonlinear ODE’s of the state variables, it is of utmost importance to find ways of accelerating convergence in COLSYS. The final question that has not been posed so far is, how does one find a superstructure? The present strategy is to use a trial-and-error approach based on heuristics. A more systematic procedure that incorporates guidelines based on characteristics of the specific reaction system will be studied in the future.","output":"The paper by Achenle and Biegler (1986) presents a novel nonlinear programming (NLP) formulation for optimizing the design of chemical reactor networks.

The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated through literature examples, highlighting its applicability to large kinetic mechanisms and different objective functions. The constant-dispersion model, presented in the paper, has several advantages, including quick calculation of adjoint variables and its ability to handle a wide range of objective functions and nonisothermal systems. However, the model has drawbacks, such as the difficulty in interpreting reactor networks with intermediate dispersion coefficients and the arbitrariness of choosing lower and upper bounds on the dispersion coefficient. To address these limitations, the authors propose the use of a recycle reactor as the basic unit in the reactor network and plan to report on a comparison between the two models in a future paper. The authors also mention the expansion of the objective function to include split fractions and reactor volumes, allowing for the incorporation of separation costs and reactor volume costs. Additionally, efforts are being made to accelerate convergence in the numerical solution of the nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) in the state variables. Future research directions discussed in the paper include the development of a systematic procedure to find a superstructure for the reactor network, incorporating guidelines based on characteristics of the specific reaction system. This will enhance the efficiency and reliability of the reactor network synthesis process."},{"instruction":"supogamos que tienes la siguiente hoja de vida: Expertise: Analista, economista, experto seo para economiacripto.com, expert in Price action, Technical analysis, macroeconomics, Investment strategy, systematic trading.

Con aquellas características que tienes, Quiero que presentes tu análisis por parte del equipo de 'EconomíaCripto' de manera atractiva, amigable, objetiva, de fácil entendimiento, analiza los puntos pivote para Intuir hacia dónde podría ir el precio, también puedes utilizar los indicadores high, close y low del día anterior para comentar al respecto. No seas repetitivo en tus explicaciones. Explica todos los puntos pivote pero no aburras al lector. Ponle ánimos. Lee estas estrategias: 1. Soporte y resistencia: Los Puntos Pivote se pueden utilizar como niveles tradicionales de soporte y resistencia. Los traders que operan en rangos colocan una orden de compra cerca de los niveles de soporte identificados y una orden de venta cerca de la resistencia. Si el precio se mueve hacia el nivel de la resistencia, puedes colocar una orden pendiente Sell Limit y un Stop Loss justo por encima de la resistencia. Si el precio se mueve hacia el nivel del soporte, puedes colocar una orden pendiente Buy Limit y un Stop por debajo del soporte. Recuerda que los niveles de soporte se convierten en resistencias si el precio está por debajo de ellos y los niveles de resistencia se convierten en soportes si el precio está por encima de ellos. 2. Niveles clave: Los traders que operan rompimientos utilizan Puntos Pivote para identificar los niveles críticos para un posible rompimiento. Si el precio cruza estos niveles, los traders esperan la próxima dirección del precio. Si ves una fuerte tendencia alcista, puedes esperar hasta que el par rompa la primera resistencia. Tan pronto como el par la rompa, puedes abrir una posición de compra y colocar un Take Profit en el siguiente nivel de resistencia. Recuerda el Stop Loss. El Stop Loss debe colocarse por debajo de la primera resistencia. Sin embargo, si el precio sigue subiendo, puedes mover tu Stop Loss manualmente. Si ves que el precio rompe el soporte, puedes comenzar a vender el par. El Take Profit estará en el nivel del siguiente soporte y el Stop Loss debe colocarse por encima del soporte que el par ha roto. También puedes mover tu Stop Loss si ves una continuación del movimiento a la baja. Ten cuidado con esta estrategia, ya que es difícil definir si se trata de un rompimiento real o uno falso. Los picos suelen ocurrir durante eventos importantes, así que mantente al día con las últimas noticias y ten conocimiento sobre lo que hay en el calendario económico para el día o la semana. 3. Tendencia del Mercado: Los Pivotes pueden ayudar a identificar la tendencia general del mercado. Si el precio rompe el Punto Pivote hacia arriba, es una señal de que hay muchos compradores en el mercado y debes comenzar a comprar el par. Un precio por debajo del Punto Pivote indicaría un sentimiento bajista y que los vendedores podrían tener la ventaja en la sesión de trading. 4. Sesiones de mercado Otra cosa vital a saber está relacionada con el horario de apertura del mercado. Como sabemos, el mercado funciona las 24 horas del día. Hay cuatro sesiones de mercado: Australia, Japón, Reino Unido y Estados Unidos. Cuando abre uno de los mercados, existe una gran posibilidad de romper los niveles Pivote, ya que muchos traders ingresan al mercado simultáneamente. Cuando el mercado estadounidense está cerrado y el mercado asiático abre, los precios pueden permanecer estables durante horas entre el Punto Pivote y el soporte o la resistencia. Esto brinda oportunidades a los traders que operan en rangos. Luego de leer esas estrategias del PivotPoints, utiliza solo una para tu análisis o crea tu propia estrategia, no quiero que menciones el nombre de la estrategia, tampoco menciones la teoría, tampoco en que consiste.

Como analista y experto en trading, te presentaré una estrategia que podría resultar interesante. En primer lugar, quiero enfocarme en los puntos pivote. Estos niveles pueden actuar como niveles de soporte y resistencia en el mercado. Si el precio se acerca a la resistencia, podrías considerar una orden pendiente de venta colocando un Stop Loss justo por encima de ese nivel. Por otro lado, si el precio se acerca al soporte, podrías considerar una orden pendiente de compra y colocar un Stop Loss debajo del soporte. Recuerda que los niveles de soporte pueden convertirse en resistencias y viceversa. Otra estrategia que podrías utilizar son los niveles clave. Si el precio rompe una resistencia, podrías abrir una posición de compra y colocar un Take Profit en el próximo nivel de resistencia. Recuerda colocar un Stop Loss por debajo de la primera resistencia. En caso de que el precio rompa el soporte, podrías considerar vender el par. El Take Profit estaría en el siguiente nivel de soporte y el Stop Loss se colocaría por encima del soporte que se ha roto. Además, los puntos pivote también pueden ayudarte a identificar la tendencia general del mercado. Si el precio rompe el punto pivote hacia arriba, indica una señal de que hay muchos compradores en el mercado y podría ser una oportunidad para comprar. Por otro lado, si el precio está por debajo del punto pivote, indica un sentimiento bajista y podría ser una señal para vender. También es importante tener en cuenta las sesiones de mercado. Cuando uno de los mercados abre, existe una mayor posibilidad de romper los niveles pivote debido a que hay más participantes en el mercado. Por ejemplo, si el mercado estadounidense está cerrado y el mercado asiático abre, los precios pueden permanecer estables durante horas entre el punto pivote y el soporte o resistencia. Ten en cuenta que esta estrategia no es una recomendación de inversión y debes realizar tu propio análisis. Recuerda invertir solo lo que estés dispuesto a perder.

Jon was still inside, talking with his dad. Emily was outside looking at the sunset when a car pulled up in the driveway. ‘Hey Emily, it's been a long time. I guess you and I have things to sort out?’ 'Do I know you?' Emily Said. 'Oh, sorry. I look different from the last time you saw me.' I’m Anna. Emily backed up, not sure how to react. ‘Emily, Okay, I will not hurt you; that person is gone now.’ ‘Please, let's sort things out. Looking back to that night long ago, I must have scared you half to death. I know many moons have risen and set since that night, but I would like to offer what apologies I may.’ ‘If you can’t take it, that’s okay; it will sting, but it’s always there.’ Anna said, trying to be reassuring. 'I don’t know what to think, what to do or say,' Emily said. Anna, no longer the rebel she had been, went over. 'Then let’s find out together, okay?' I heard about Jon; I would have come. But was stuck in Angola; and work for the UNHCR as a coordinator; yes, I know someone with a history like mine.' 'Honestly, if I’d stayed like that, I would have been dead now. ‘That explains the look,’ Emily said. Anna exhaled softly in acceptance. 'Yeah, the UNHCR is not the place where the punk look goes well. As a result, I had to smarten up both in appearance and attitude, had help with both, and here it is, or rather, she has arrived.' A young woman of some 25 years of Angolan descent walked up the drive. Emily had seen women like this before; had this person been a child soldier, then a mercenary? ‘Koboki, you’ve come?’ ‘Always, you've got a long way to go on your path, Miss Anna, before you’re trusted to interact with others alone. Besides, I always want to be where you are.’ Koboki said. ‘Now, who is this delightful young woman I see before me?’ 'Koboki, you know well who this is; this is my brother’s wife, Emily.' 'Ah, yes, of course—the one you half-frightened to death, if I recall. 'Yes, quite right, right, but that was long ago, and I don’t expect Emily to take it right away. I have to earn it if she’ll allow it.' ‘Emily, where are you?’ Jon Called. ‘Out here’ Emily called back. Jon came out to find Emily, and then he saw Anna and was-taken aback. ‘Long time, Anna.’ Jon Said ‘Agreed,’ Anna responded, 'about that night.' Jon stopped her. 'Let’s not bring up old fights that are long settled, eh?' ‘I kind of need to, so I can heal,’ Anna said. ‘I think you have experience with that?’ She continued. Jon looked at his wife and then back at his sister. ‘Okay, yeah, I see your point. I mean, look at you now, UNHCR, and all. What's next, UN Secretary General?’ ‘Let’s not get carried away,’ Anna said. 'Sorry, but look how far you’ve come.' ‘Jon, it’s been a long, painful road. I have a long way to travel yet. I’m not quite certain I’ll ever receive the utmost resolution. I’ve caused too much pain that cannot be-taken back for that. 'All I can do now is reach out to the people I can.' ‘You have come a long way, transformed. I would venture, but I have to heal yet myself.’ ‘I heard about that from dad; like I said to Emily just now. I would have come, but I was stuck working in Angola and couldn’t get away.’ ‘I wouldn’t have expected you to break off because the people you were with were in far greater need.’ ‘True, but none are family.’ Jon silently mouthed, ‘I know.’ In the house, Jon and Anna’s dad, Jake, watched from the window and came out. ‘Anna, you’ve come; I wasn’t expecting you.’ Jake said. ‘I know,’ Anna sighed softly, ‘but since Jon and Emily are here. I think it’s time to clear the air; there is a poison in this family that has run its course.' Jake hooked the thumb of his left hand into the waistband of his jeans. Placed his right on his chin in contemplation, nodding in agreement. ‘Anna, that’s fine or it would be if your mom were stronger. She's back in Bright Valley but may not be home for some months yet.’ Koboki moved to Anna’s side. ‘Tell your truth, Anna.’ 'I see your conflict, your doubt.' ‘Thank you, Koboki.’ ‘What am I meant to do? I have to fly out again soon, this time to East Africa, and I may not be home again for, well, I don’t know how long. Could we all go to see Mom tomorrow and sort this out?’ Anna asked. ‘Sorry, no, Mom has allowed no one to come right now; she’s not doing so well.’ ‘Damn,’ Anna nearly screamed. Koboki ran to her and kept her safe, helping Anna process what she was feeling. ‘Sis you okay?’ Jon asked. 'Give me a minute; I’ll be fine, and thanks,' Anna said. ‘Dad, couldn’t we let her say what she’s got to say to us? Then she could speak to Mom some other time?’ Jon said, looking at his clearly stressed sister. Jake looked at Anna, then down at the ground, and then closely at Jon. 'Alright, but I don’t think that’s what Anna had in mind. There are some things cannot be-handled that way; it's easier with everyone together,' Jake said. ‘Dad, look at her.’ Jon said. 'Anna, I have an idea.' 'It's not what you want, and I get that, but here’s a compromise of sorts.' Jon Offered Anna looked up and said, 'what sort of compromise?' ‘Could you split what you’ve got to say in half? Say what you need to dad and me. Then when Mom is feeling stronger, say what you need to her.’ ‘Your right. It would be easier with everyone in the same room at the same time.’ ‘Would you do it for me?’ You had before,' Koboki said. Anna looked at Koboki, closed her eyes, and exhaled softly. ‘She’s right Jon, that I said just-now was the old me talking. I don’t like it. But yeah, appreciate that when I talk to Mom, you, Emily, and Dad have to come as undoubtedly. Some things I will say.’ ‘You all need to speak at length,’ ‘If you want us to, fine. We can do that now that it's getting late. I’m getting cold, and well you know.’Jake said. Koboki looked at the unfolding scene. O night unveils the truth hidden behind this mask of pain, worn since ages passed by this family. Torn apart, hidden from each other, within view, yet each remains unseen. O, what burdens each has reaped. A bitter harvest of tears and rage; all things yet unspoken lie as wreckage of shattered years. O mother of my ancestors, smile upon these weary trampled souls; turn their longings into hope and. All their rage to peace. I am the daughter of a distant land. My stories fill not the mouths of babes. I am just-an actor without a stage. We are who we are; we are a speck of truth or hide it in a vial of lies. We are all we are, a hand reaching out of cloudy skies. O night, O night, settle the hurts of ages so these people may find peace. Emily understood and responded. E’er the night, truths unspoken in lands. No eye has lain upon; silently comes resolution of emotional years. So hope comes out of bitterness and long-held, uncried tears. They travel to the land far beyond the skies from dark towers, where shadows race. Time demands, and memories retrace the travellers’ paths. I am just a stone along your way; I am in the gloom that hangs over the forest at night. I am the song that a bard of old has sung, telling wrong from right.

Flash of silver against the blackness dart, before the poet’s words from the pen have flown. Then breathe silently against the stillborn air. Of hope, of longings and tidings to start anew to see with newborn eyes, without the clouds of yesterday, but what price would you have to pay? Or do words of scorn find you to say?

Bayesian optimization are two different techniques used in the field of optimization, but they have some similarities and differences. Taguchi design, developed by Dr. Genichi Taguchi, is a robust design methodology that aims to improve quality and minimize variation in engineering and manufacturing processes. It emphasizes the use of orthogonal arrays to efficiently conduct experiments and identify optimal process settings. Taguchi design is often used to optimize multiple input variables with a limited number of experimental runs. Bayesian optimization, on the other hand, is a sequential model-based optimization technique that uses probabilistic models, such as Gaussian processes, to model the objective function and make predictions about its behavior. It iteratively selects the next set of input parameters, taking into account both exploration (sampling from uncertain regions) and exploitation (sampling from promising regions). Bayesian optimization is effective when the objective function is expensive to evaluate, as it minimizes the number of function evaluations required to reach the optimal solution. Here are some comparisons between Taguchi design and Bayesian optimization: 1. Approach: Taguchi design focuses on conducting a set of experiments to identify the optimal process settings, while Bayesian optimization uses a probabilistic model to sequentially explore and exploit the parameter space. 2. Experimental Design: Taguchi design uses orthogonal arrays to efficiently allocate the experimental runs, while Bayesian optimization dynamically selects input parameters based on the previous observations and the probabilistic model. 3. Robustness: Taguchi design aims to find settings that are robust to variations and noise, whereas Bayesian optimization aims to find the globally optimal solution. 4. Objective Function Evaluation: Taguchi design typically requires a fixed number of experimental runs to evaluate the objective function, while Bayesian optimization adaptively decides the number of evaluations based on the convergence of the optimization process. Overall, Taguchi design is suitable for optimizing engineering processes with a limited number of experimental runs, while Bayesian optimization is more appropriate for problems where the objective function is expensive to evaluate and a limited number of function evaluations is desired."},{"instruction":"taguchi design faster converge than bayesian optimization","output":"In general, Taguchi design tends to converge faster compared to Bayesian optimization. This is because Taguchi design uses orthogonal arrays to efficiently allocate experimental runs, allowing for a larger parameter space exploration with a limited number of experiments. This leads to a quicker identification of the optimal process settings. On the other hand, Bayesian optimization is an iterative process that sequentially explores and exploits the parameter space based on the probabilistic model of the objective function. While Bayesian optimization is efficient in finding the global optimum with a limited number of function evaluations, it may require more iterations to converge compared to Taguchi design. However, it's important to note that the convergence speed of both methods depends on the nature of the optimization problem, the complexity of the objective function, and other factors such as noise and constraints. In some cases, Bayesian optimization may outperform Taguchi design in terms of convergence speed, especially when the objective function is expensive to evaluate. Additionally, the convergence speed can also be influenced by the choice of hyperparameters and the implementation details of each method."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

It lends valuable insights into real-world challenges, best practices, and effective approaches to information security management. Competence also extends beyond individuals to other entities, such as external service providers or contractors, who may have a role in managing information security within the organization. These entities should demonstrate their competence through relevant certifications, qualifications, or documented capabilities. The emphasis on competence in ISO/IEC 27001:2022 underscores the importance of having individuals and entities with the necessary knowledge, skills, and experience to effectively contribute to the implementation, maintenance, and improvement of the ISMS. It ensures that the organization has capable personnel who can navigate the complexities of information security, mitigate risks, and protect valuable information assets."},{"instruction":"What could be measured and monitored in order the effectiveness and efficiency of the ISMS to be assessed (give examples)?","output":"To assess the effectiveness and efficiency of an Information Security Management System (ISMS), several key aspects can be measured and monitored. Here are some examples: 1. Security incident metrics: Monitor the number, type, and severity of security incidents, such as breaches, unauthorized access, malware infections, or data leaks. Measure the frequency and impact of incidents to evaluate the effectiveness of incident response capabilities, incident management processes, and the overall security posture. 2. Compliance metrics: Track compliance with information security policies, procedures, regulatory requirements, and contractual obligations. Monitor the number and nature of compliance violations or gaps to assess the effectiveness of controls, training and awareness programs, and the organization's commitment to information security. 3. Risk assessment outcomes: Regularly review risk assessment outcomes to assess the identification and treatment of risks. Measure risk levels, risk reduction over time, and the implementation of controls to evaluate the effectiveness of risk management efforts and the organization's ability to mitigate threats and vulnerabilities. 4. Security control effectiveness: Assess the effectiveness of implemented security controls by monitoring their performance and functionality. Measure the efficiency of controls in mitigating identified risks, such as access control measures, intrusion detection systems, encryption mechanisms, or vulnerability management processes. 5. Incident response metrics: Monitor the time taken to detect, contain, and resolve security incidents. Measure response and recovery times to evaluate the efficiency of incident response plans, incident handling processes, and the overall incident management capabilities. 6. Employee training and awareness: Track employee participation and completion rates for information security training and awareness programs. Conduct periodic surveys or assessments to measure the effectiveness of training in enhancing employees' knowledge, behavior, and adherence to security policies and procedures. 7. System availability and uptime: Monitor system availability and uptime to assess the effectiveness of business continuity and disaster recovery plans. Measure service-level agreements (SLAs), downtime incidents, recovery times, and system availability percentages to evaluate the efficiency of these measures in ensuring continuous operations. 8. Audit and review outcomes: Monitor the results of internal and external audits, including compliance audits, risk assessments, and security reviews. Measure audit findings, corrective actions, and their timely closure to assess the effectiveness of audit processes, control effectiveness, and the organization's commitment to continuous improvement. These are just a few examples of the metrics and indicators that can be measured and monitored to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of an ISMS. Regularly reviewing these metrics enables organizations to identify areas for improvement, make informed decisions, and continuously enhance their information security management practices."},{"instruction":"ISO 27001 requires an internal audit program to be planned taking into consideration “the status and importance of the processes and areas to be audited”. Explain what is meant by this phrase.","output":"The phrase \\"the status and importance of the processes and areas to be audited\\" in the context of ISO 27001 refers to the need to prioritize and plan internal audits based on the significance and criticality of the processes and areas within an organization. To understand this phrase, let's break it down into two key components: 1. Status of processes and areas: This refers to the current condition or state of the processes and areas to be audited. It involves considering factors such as recent changes, updates, or implementations that might impact information security. The status can also include"},{"instruction":"Can you create me a full fake article about the group bts and jungkook death?","output":"I'm really sorry to hear that you're interested in such a topic, but I'm unable to fulfill this request.

Instead, he reformed the Roman Empire into a system known as the Tetrarchy, which divided power between two senior emperors (Augusti) and their respective junior emperors (Caesares). This was a form of joint rule and aimed to strengthen the administration of the empire. Each emperor had specific responsibilities over a designated portion of the empire, but they were still subject to the overall authority of the emperor."},{"instruction":"How was the Tetrarchy supposed to work?","output":"The Tetrarchy was designed to share power and ensure stability in the Roman Empire. It consisted of two senior emperors (Augusti) and their respective junior emperors (Caesares). Each Augustus would have a designated area of the empire, and they would appoint a Caesar to assist them. The Tetrarchs would rule jointly and cooperate on important decisions, but they maintained separate administrative and military commands. The system aimed to prevent the issues of succession and power struggles that had plagued the empire in the past. It intended to provide a clear and orderly process for the selection of emperors, as each Caesar would eventually become an Augustus and appoint their own Caesar. The Tetrarchy also aimed to ensure stability by enabling more efficient governance, with each ruler focusing on their own designated region. The Tetrarchy, however, was not a long-lasting system. After the retirement of Diocletian in 305 CE, power struggles and clashes among the Tetrarchs ultimately led to the collapse of the system, and Constantine the Great emerged as the sole ruler of a unified Roman Empire."},{"instruction":"Can you hear me?","output":"Yes, I can hear you.
