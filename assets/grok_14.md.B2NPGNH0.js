Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona decided to find out. The adventurous senator took a vacation from Capitol Hill and went on a fourday Robinson Crusoe style holiday with his two teenage sons to a remote, deserted island in the North Pacific Ocean. The senator and his sons, 15yearold Tanner and 13yearold Dallin, traveled 5,200 miles from Phoenix, Arizona to the island of Biggarenn. They didn't carry any food or water. The island is part of the Marshall Islands. It offered no basic supplies, so the Flakes had to catch and cook their own food and purify their water. Their diet was made up of coconuts, crabs and fish. They caught the crab and fish themselves and cooked the food over an open fire started with a magnifying glass  . The Flakes brought along a lobster trap   in the hope of having some delicious treats, but lost it within the first few hours after it was attacked by a shark. They also carried two pumps to remove salt from ocean water. It took them hours each night to pump for just a few gallons of fresh water. One of the most memorable moments of the trip, the father said, was when he and his 15yearold son were almost caught by sharks after spearing   a fish in the ocean. Still, it was quite an enjoyable holiday for them. \\"For a dad it was a wonderful thing. No video games around, no television, no disturbance, no texting,\\" Flake recalled. Question: What can we learn from the text? Options: A: The Flakes could easily find a fire on the island. B: The Flakes caught lobsters for food on the island. C: The Flakes found basic things that they needed on the island. D: The Flakes took much trouble to get drinkable water on the island.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article: Kevin de Bruyne put the league leaders in front with a low free-kick under the wall after a Jack Wilshere foul. City were dominant and two clinical counter-attacks led to Kelechi Iheanacho and Raheem Sterling tap-ins. Ilkay Gundogan calmly slotted in a fourth but City had Nolito sent off late on for an attempted head-butt. The Spaniard was involved in a clash with Adam Smith and, while any contact with his head looked slight, referee Jon Moss had little option but to dismiss the winger. Relive Manchester City's win over Bournemouth Follow action and reaction to Saturday's games City's passing and movement was a joy to watch and the influential De Bruyne was at the heart of their play. The Belgian midfielder, who scored in the win over against Manchester United last week, played behind main striker Iheanacho and caused Bournemouth all sorts of problems as he was involved in all his side's goals before going off to a standing ovation. De Bruyne's absence for two months last season was a huge setback for City as they dropped from second to fourth in the Premier League, and from three points behind leaders Leicester to 15. The 25-year-old's intelligence, running with the ball and vision made him a constant threat and his link-up play with Sterling, Nolito and Iheanacho left Bournemouth bemused. \\"The performance from Kevin was terrific, amazing,\\" said City boss Pep Guardiola. \\"He is on another level. He is a fantastic player and helps us a lot.\\" Sterling did score a hat-trick against the Cherries at the Etihad last season but, for most of the campaign, was a subdued presence following his £49m move from Liverpool. However, the 21-year-old appears to be back to his livewire best as he closely pushed De Bruyne in the man of the match stakes. The dribbling skills and pace that make him such a threat were impressively on show against Bournemouth and he has clearly benefited from the arrival of Guardiola. The City boss phoned Sterling during the summer before officially taking over to tell the winger he was a big part of his plans, and the Spaniard looks to have restored his confidence. Apart from his goal, and his assist for Iheanacho, Sterling also went close when he dispossessed Charlie Daniels on the right flank, producing a mesmerising run across the Cherries box - past a host of defenders - before seeing his shot hit the post. Overall, Sterling has now had a hand in eight goals in his seven appearances for Manchester City this season, scoring three and assisting five. Like his team, Wilshere looked out of his depth on a chastening afternoon for both as he made his first start of the season following his loan move from Arsenal. Bournemouth boss Eddie Howe replaced striker Callum Wilson, who scored the winner against West Brom last week, with the England man to reinforce his midfield, but the move did not pay off. Wilshere clumsily shoved Nolito off the ball to concede the free-kick from which City scored their opener and the 24-year-old struggled to have an impact on the game. The visitors were also guilty of giving the ball away too cheaply and, although Josh King's pace did cause City some moments of concern, they rarely had the ball long enough to use that as a weapon. Bournemouth, who saw Wilson's shot hit the crossbar, had 35.7% possession in the match. \\"It was difficult for Jack in the first half, because he's at his best when he has the ball, and we didn't have too much of it,\\" said Howe. Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola: \\"Our high pressing was not perfect today - we had problems with controlling the Bournemouth build-up, but we created a lot of counter-attacks. On the sending off of Nolito: \\"The referee took a decision and we have to accept that.\\" Media playback is not supported on this device Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe: \\"It was a tough day. Manchester City were excellent. The nature of the first two goals against us was disappointing. \\"They're a very impressive team. When you play against the best, your learning is accelerated.

Article: Getting enough sleep on a regular basis is one important way to protect the health of your heart. Poor sleep is associated with a range of cardiovascular  problems, including high blood pressure, heart attack, and heart failure. Both men and women are at increased risk for these conditions. But we continue to learn that when it comes to health problems associated with sleep, the particular risks to men and women are not always the same. A new study suggests that for women who already have heart disease, poor sleep may be particularly dangerous to their heart health. Research indicates that poor-quality sleep--and waking too early in particular--is associated with increased inflammation  among women with heart disease. There was no similar association found for men, suggesting that women with heart disease and sleep problems may be at particular risk for inflammation that can be damaging to the heart. Researchers at the University of California, San Francisco investigated the relationship between sleep quality and inflammation linked to coronary  heart disease. They also sought information about how an association between sleep and inflammation might differ between men and women. Their investigation included 980 men and women at first, and 626 completed the 5-year study. All of those included were suffering for coronary heart disease. The average age of men in the study was 66. Women were slightly younger, with an average age of 64. Researchers measured sleep quality by asking participants to rate their sleep over the previous month. They also asked for reports of some of the most common sleep problems, including difficulty falling asleep, difficulty staying asleep, waking frequently throughout the night, and waking too early in the morning. After 5 years, researchers repeated tests for inflammation and once again sought reports on sleep quality and sleep problems. When they analyzed data for both men and women together, researchers found no links between inflammations and sleep quality. However, when they...

Article: When was the last time your family sat down together to have a dinner? The speed at which we live today no longer allows for slow eating habits. Most people work long hours. There is lots of fast food and eating out is now on the increase. Often, food is eaten in front of the television in silence, or a child eats alone in front of the computer. When I was a child, every evening around the same time, one of the children would be asked to set the table, and then we'd go and wash our hands: before the meal. This was the time of day when we would talk about our day at school. But now things have changed a lot. A family environment plays an important role for children in learning to communicate with others and understanding table manners, such as waiting for others to finish before leaving the table and not speaking with a mouth full of food. Parents' likes and dislikes of a certain food will also influence a child's own likes and dislikes. Studies have shown that children who often eat with their families have better results at school than children who eat with their families less than twice a week. Regular meal times give children the chance to discuss their problems with family members. They can also learn to respect others around the table. Talking to your children over dinner is the best way of having their-trust. Children learn good eating habits from their parents at a very young age. Family meals are important.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. The £10m device was lifted into place at the new Imaging Centre of Excellence (ICE) at the city's Queen Elizabeth University Hospital (QEUH). A giant crane eased the 18-tonne scanner down an alleyway with inches to spare on each side, then through a hole in the wall of the new building. Once it is installed and calibrated it will be used to research - and help treat - a variety of conditions such as stroke, vascular dementia, Alzheimer's disease and epilepsy. In its current condition it looks like a space capsule - a huge, upended metal doughnut with a hole where the patient will go. And like many a space shot it is a thing of superlatives. There is enough wire wrapped around its huge magnets to stretch from London to Brussels. When it is operating, those magnets - but not the patient - will be cooled to minus 269 Celsius. That is the temperature of deep space. So this particular corner of Glasgow will become one of the coldest places in the universe. The unit of strength of a magnetic field is a Tesla (T), named after the Serbian-American pioneer Nikola Tesla. The magnetic fields of the MRI scanners currently in use in Scotland range from around 1.5T to 3T. The new scanner's field strength will be 7T. Or to put it another way, 140,000 times stronger than the magnetic field of planet Earth itself. The head of Glasgow University's College of Medical, Veterinary and Life Sciences, Prof Dame Anna Dominiczak, sees it as an endorsement of the pioneering work already done there. \\"Glasgow is a centre of excellence for chronic disease research and management, and also for clinical trials,\\" she says. \\"So as a leader in this area we think we are the best to get a 7 Tesla scanner.\\" With that field strength will come more detail than existing scanners. Much more. It has been likened to going from an ordinary TV picture to HD. That added detail will mean far greater opportunities to research and teach - and to treat patients from the QEUH campus with new precision medicine techniques. MRI scanners may seem new-fangled to many of us. If so, we are just showing our age. Glaswegians have been getting scanned for more than 30 years now. If we ourselves haven't been scanned, chances are we know someone who has. But do we know what's going on in there? Happily the university's professor of clinical imaging, Keith Muir, can explain. \\"Essentially we're using a very strong magnetic field which is going to line up all the water in your head in one direction,\\" he says. \\"And then by applying clever radio pulses it's going to spin them round in various ways that can be detected as very small radio signals which are used through vast computing power to reconstruct a detailed picture of the bit we're imaging.\\" As with many big ticket science projects, collaboration and co-funding are key. The university is taking the lead, in partnership with NHS Greater Glasgow & Clyde. The ICE which now houses the scanner is costing £32m, with money coming from the UK government's Medical Research Council, the European Regional Development Fund, The Sackler Trust and the Dr Mortimer and Theresa Sackler Foundation. The scanner's proper name is the Siemens Magnetom Terra. It will take months to set up but once the electrical and civil engineering are over, the science can begin.

Once the machine is set up, doctors will use it to study and treat different illnesses – such as strokes, Alzheimer's disease, and epilepsy – more precisely than ever before. That's because the machine can take really detailed pictures of what's going on in people's bodies. The MRI scanner might look like a space capsule right now, but that's because it's so big and heavy. There's also a lot of wire—enough to stretch from London to Brussels!

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given the question: Given the background: As new seafloor forms and spreads apart from the mid-ocean ridge it slowly cools over time. Older seafloor is, therefore, colder than new seafloor, and older oceanic basins deeper than new oceanic basins due to isostasy. If the diameter of the earth remains relatively constant despite the production of new crust, a mechanism must exist by which crust is also destroyed. The destruction of oceanic crust occurs at subduction zones where oceanic crust is forced under either continental crust or oceanic crust. Today, the Atlantic basin is actively spreading at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Only a small portion of the oceanic crust produced in the Atlantic is subducted. However, the plates making up the Pacific Ocean are experiencing subduction along many of their boundaries which causes the volcanic activity in what has been termed the Ring of Fire of the Pacific Ocean. The Pacific is also home to one of the world's most active spreading centers (the East Pacific Rise) with spreading rates of up to 13  cm/yr. The Mid-Atlantic Ridge is a \\"textbook\\" slow-spreading center, while the East Pacific Rise is used as an example of fast spreading. Spreading centers at slow and intermediate rates exhibit a rift valley while at fast rates an axial high is found within the crustal accretion zone. The differences in spreading rates affect not only the geometries of the ridges but also the geochemistry of the basalts that are produced.Since the new oceanic basins are shallower than the old oceanic basins, the total capacity of the world's ocean basins decreases during times of active sea floor spreading. During the opening of the Atlantic Ocean, sea level was so high that a Western Interior Seaway formed across North America from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean.  and the situation: Barry and Will are two geologists. Barry is specialized in subduction zones and new seafloor. Will is specialized in montology.  Answer the following question: Which person learned less about the Mid-Atlantic Ridge? The answer is:","output":"Will learned less about the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. As a geologist specialized in montology (study of mountains), his expertise is focused on the formation, structure, and evolution of mountains, rather than on seafloor spreading and subduction zones. Barry, on the other hand, is specialized in subduction zones and new seafloor, which makes him more knowledgeable about the processes related to the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, including seafloor spreading, crustal formation, and other geological and geochemical phenomena associated with the ridge."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Trump has already been out on the campaign trail testing themes for his expected re-election bid. \\"Our new slogan for 2020. Do you know what it is? Keep America great!\\" Trump told cheering supporters at a recent rally in Elkhart, Indiana. But Trump also made it clear he is concerned about this year's congressional midterm elections, in which opposition Democrats are favored to make gains.  \\"And all of the great momentum that we are having as a country on jobs, on safety, on security, on our military — it is all at stake in November,\\" Trump warned at the Indiana rally.  2020 is expected to produce a bumper crop of Democratic presidential contenders who will vie for their party's nomination. Those in the group range from the well-known like former Vice President Joe Biden and 2016 contender Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont to a younger, less recognizable contingent that includes California Senator Kamala Harris and New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand. Several potential Democratic presidential contenders spoke about the party's future at a recent conference in Washington hosted by the Center for American Progress, a Democratic-leaning public policy institute in Washington. Among the speakers was Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, who said Democrats face an uphill battle to win back control of Congress this year because of long-standing Republican advantages in winning a majority in the House of Representatives. \\"We can't climb that hill by ignoring the millions of Americans who are angry and scared about the damage this president and this Republican Party have done to our democracy,\\" Warren told the conference to a round of applause. \\"We can't ignore it and we shouldn't want to ignore it.\\" Question: Where did Trump state \\"Our new slogan for 2020. Do you know what it is? Keep America great!\\"? Options: - The White House - not enough information - Washington, DC - Elkhart, Indiana A:","output":"Trump stated \\"Our new slogan for 2020.

Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","output":"To determine if the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence, let's examine both sentences closely and analyze their meanings. Sentence 1: And do you agree with him that it was worth having made the start, even if the end was likely to be bad? This sentence is asking if you agree with a person's belief that initiating something (the start) was worthwhile, even if it is anticipated to yield an undesirable outcome (the end likely to be bad). Sentence 2: Do you agree that it's going to succeed? This sentence is asking if you agree with the proposition that something will be successful. Step 1: Identify the propositions presented in both sentences. - Proposition 1: It was worth having made the start (even if the end was likely to be bad) - Proposition 2: It's going to succeed Step 2: Compare the propositions. - Proposition 1 implies that there is value in starting an action despite potential negative consequences. - Proposition 2 suggests that the action will be successful. Step 3: Determine if the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence. - The first sentence does not imply that it will be successful. Instead, it focuses on the value of beginning the action, even if the outcome is likely negative. The second sentence is about agreeing on the success of the action.

Is the premise \\"Children are performing a routine on stage.\\" true if \\"Children swimming in a pool\\"?","output":"To assess the truth of the premise \\"Children are performing a routine on stage\\" when given the situation \\"Children swimming in a pool,\\" we must first break down and analyze each statement to determine if they are compatible. 1. \\"Children are performing a routine on stage.\\" This statement implies that children are involved in some form of organized and planned performance, usually consisting of dancing, acting, singing, or a combination of these activities. This is taking place on a stage which is a raised platform specifically designed for performances. 2. \\"Children swimming in a pool.\\" In this situation, children are engaged in a water-based activity, which takes place in a swimming pool. Swimming is a physical activity typically focused on enjoyment, exercise, or learning specific swimming techniques. Comparing the two statements, \\"Children are performing a routine on stage\\" and \\"Children swimming in a pool,\\" it is evident that they describe two distinct scenarios with varying locations and activities. As such, we cannot claim that the premise \\"Children are performing a routine on stage\\" is true based solely on information about children swimming in a pool. To say the premise is true, we would require additional information indicating that these children are indeed performing a routine on a stage. For example, it could be possible that the children are participating in synchronized swimming—an organized routine performed in a pool. In this case, we may consider the pool as a stage for this specific type of performance, thus making the premise true.

Obama: Qaddafi Needs To Leave Now Speaking out against Muammar al-Qaddafi for the first time, President Obama said on Saturday the Libyan leader needs to \\"leave now,\\" having lost the legitimacy to rule. In a White House statement on Obama's telephone call with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, Obama took his most direct position yet on the escalating violence in Libya. \\"The president stated that when a leader's only means of staying in power is to use mass violence against his own people, he has lost the legitimacy to rule and needs to do what is right for his country by leaving now,\\" it said. Obama's stance comes after he signed an executive order Friday freezing assets held by Qaddafi and four of his children in the United States. The Treasury Department said the sanctions against Qaddafi, three of his sons and a daughter also apply to the Libyan government. Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton announced further sanctions Saturday, revoking visas for senior Libyan officials and their immediate family members. She said future applications from those blacklisted for travel to the United States would be rejected. Qaddafi \\"should go without further bloodshed and violence,\\" Clinton said in a separate statement. Obama has been conferring with world leaders about the unrest in Libya. The administration is hoping that the world speaks with a single voice against Qaddafi's violent crackdown on protesters, and Obama is sending Clinton to Geneva on Sunday to coordinate with foreign policy chiefs from several countries. The U.N. Security Council met urgently Saturday and voted unanimously to impose new sanctions against Libya. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon wants immediate action to protect Libyan civilians. The U.N. chief was due in Washington on Monday for talks with Obama at the White House. The administration had been facing increasing pressure to more forcefully condemn Qaddafi and explicitly call for his ouster, as French President Nicolas Sarkozy has done. Witnesses in Libya said Qaddafi is arming civilian supporters to set up checkpoints and roving patrols in Tripoli, the capital. The U.S. held back, but its tone shifted sharply on Friday after Americans in Libya were evacuated to safety by ferry and a chartered airplane. Shortly after, Obama signed an executive order outlining financial penalties designed to pressure Qaddafi's government into halting the violence. The order said that the instability in Libya constituted an \\"unusual and extraordinary threat\\" to U.S. national security and foreign policy. A nonviolent revolt against Qaddafi's government began Feb. 15 amid a wave of uprisings in the Arab world. Most of Libya's eastern half is under the control of rebels. Witnesses say Qaddafi's government has responded by shooting at protesters in numerous cities. The Associated Press contributed to this report. What was this article about?","output":"This article is about President Obama saying that the Libyan leader, Muammar al-Qaddafi, needs to leave his position as leader because he is using violence against his own people.

Answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What was the first name of Sir Terence Aubrey Murray's wife?  The area now called Yarralumla is part of two original land grants, which were granted to free settlers for the establishment of farms. In 1828 Henry Donnison, a Sydney merchant who had arrived with his wife and family on the brig Ellen on 29–30 July 1828, was granted an allotment on the western side of Stirling Ridge. A second grant was made to William Klensendorlffe (a German who had served in the British Navy and arrived free in the Colony in 1818), who had bought the land from John Stephen, on 7 March 1839. Donnison's land was named Yarralumla in a survey of the area conducted in 1834. Yarralumla was a name for the area used by the local people, apparently meaning \\"echo\\". An area to the west of what is now the suburb was the Yarrolumla parish.The prominent New South Wales parliamentarian Sir Terence Aubrey Murray (1810–1873) purchased Yarralumla in 1837. He lived there with his wife Mary Murray (née Gibbes, 1817–1858), the second daughter of the Collector of Customs for NSW, Colonel John George Nathaniel Gibbes (1787–1873), MLC. In 1859, Murray sold Yarralumla to his brother-in-law, Augustus Onslow Manby Gibbes (1828–1897). Later that same year, Augustus' parents came to live with him at Yarralumla homestead. Augustus Gibbes improved the estate and acquired additional land by purchase and lease. However, In 1881, he sold Yarralumla for 40,000 pounds to Frederick Campbell, a descendant of Robert Campbell, in order to travel overseas. Frederick Campbell erected a new, three-storey, brick house on the site of the former Yarralumla homestead at the beginning of the 1890s. Campbell's house would later form the basis of what is now the Governor-General of Australia's official Canberra residence, known colloquially as \\"Yarralumla\\" or \\"Government House\\". Campbell also built a large wooden woolshed nearby in 1904.

The athlete spent time each day during his training sessions consciously working on his mindset, reminding himself that his skills and abilities mattered far more than the specific helmet he wore. He also reminded himself that all his rivals were in the same situation, giving him no relative disadvantage. Slowly but surely, his anxiety about the change in rules began to fade away. Step 2: Focus on improving physical performance Justification: As his mindset improves, now is the time to ensure his training and physical preparedness is at its peak. The athlete began to train more vigorously, pushing himself to improve his speed, endurance, and agility. The thought of succeeding at the final competition without his personal helmet energized him and acted as a driving force to perfect his skills. He sought advice from his coach, analyzed his past performances, and made necessary adjustments to his training regimen. Step 3: Familiarize himself with the new helmet Justification: This will help him feel more comfortable and adapt to the change, ultimately minimizing its impact on his performance.

Each day during practice, he wore the new helmet, ensuring that by the time the competition arrived, it would feel like a natural extension of his body. Step 4: The final competition Justification: With the right mindset, improved skills, and familiarization with the new helmet, the athlete is now prepared to give his all during the final competition. On the day of the final competition, the athlete donned the provided helmet with confidence, knowing that he had done everything in his power to prepare for this moment. As he stepped out onto the field, any lingering concerns about the helmet had vanished. His focus was entirely on the task ahead of him, and he knew he was ready to give it his best. With each moment of the intense competition, the athlete showcased his incredible skill and determination, proving that the absence of his personalized helmet did not affect his performance. He tackled challenges fearlessly, pushed through fatigue and pain, all while wearing the helmet he had grown accustomed to. In the end, his efforts paid off – he emerged victorious, securing the championship title. Both his personal growth and adaptation to the new rules had helped shape the athlete he had become. As he stood on the podium with his gold medal, he knew that the journey had been well worth it and that he never needed his old helmet to be the best – it was always within him."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. By. Daily Mail Reporter. UPDATED:. 09:11 EST, 5 April 2012. A state investigation has found no. evidence of child abuse by a Kennedy heir who tried to take his newborn. son from a maternity ward, a family lawyer said today. Attorney Robert Gottlieb said Douglas. Kennedy, son of the late Senator Robert F Kennedy, received a letter from. New York's child protection agency declaring that a report of child. abuse had been determined to be unfounded. On January 7, he tried to take the. newborn boy from the maternity ward at Northern Westchester Hospital in. Mount Kisco, more than 30 miles from Manhattan. Nurses objected, and the. hospital reported the incident to the state. Charges: Douglas Kennedy, pictured with wife Molly and their son Bo, or 'Boru', was charged over the fracas. The Office of Children and Family Services investigated after Kennedy was charged with child endangerment in February. Susan Steele, an agency spokeswoman, said today by email that confidentiality laws prohibit her from commenting. Gottlieb said the agency's. investigation is separate from the criminal prosecution and doesn't. negate the endangerment charge against Kennedy, but he hopes prosecutors. will take it into consideration. 'It is our fervent hope that the. Westchester district attorney will continue to evaluate this case, and. we remain hopeful that the DA will ultimately dismiss that charge,' he. said. Hospital: Douglas Kennedy is shown in security footage trying to take his newborn son for a walk outside. 'Attack': A figure shown falling over in the corridor is said to be a nurse kicked in the crotch by Mr Kennedy. Gottlieb said the probe covered the hospital encounter and a home visit. 'They investigated everything,' he said. He said the agency's finding was 'the first glimmer of reason that has surfaced in this case since it erupted in the press.' The finding has nothing to do with charges of physical harassment against Kennedy stemming from the same encounter. One nurse says Kennedy twisted her arm as she tried to keep him from leaving with the baby, and another says he kicked her. Anna Margaret Lane and Cari Maleman. Luciano told MSNBC they were involved in a vicious scuffle with the 44-year-old after he tried to get in a lift with his son. Scene: The altercation happened at the Northern Westchester Hospital in suburban New York on January 7. Kennedy, 44, has said he was. protecting the child as the nurses tried to grab him. ‘We kept saying to him: “We need to. step out of the elevator, we need to get the baby to your room”,’ Ms. Luciano said, adding that Mr Kennedy replied: ‘I don't have to listen to. you. It's my child.’ Mr Kennedy claims that as he was. leaning against a door to back out of the maternity ward, a nurse came. toward him, he lifted his left knee and it came into contact with the. nurse to protect his son. That. nurse, Ms Luciano, fell backwards and Ms Lane then accused Kennedy of. twisting her arm. But Mr Kennedy denies this. He returned the baby to. the maternity ward rather than go outside. ‘I. still have pain in my arm,’ Ms Lane told MSNBC. Ms Luciano added: ‘I. wanted to make sure the baby was safe and secure and he brought his leg. up and kicked me. I went flying through the air.’ Fox. News reporter Mr Kennedy, who is married to Molly, is the son of late. politician Robert ‘RFK’ Kennedy - brother of former president John ‘JFK’ Kennedy. RFK was fatally shot in 1968. ‘It is sickening to think that our. simple desire to take our son outside for fresh air has been warped into. a charge of child endangerment,’ Douglas and Ethel Kennedy said in a. statement. Lucian Chalfen, spokesman for the. district attorney, wouldn't comment. Douglas Kennedy, a reporter for Fox. News, is due in Mount Kisco Court on April 12. Mr Kennedy is the. 10th child of Ethel and Robert F. Kennedy, a U.S. senator, Attorney General and presidential. candidate assassinated in June 1968 in Los Angeles, California - five. years after the death of his brother JFK. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"A man named Douglas Kennedy, whose dad was a famous person named Robert F Kennedy, got into some trouble when he tried to take his newborn baby out of the hospital for a walk. The nurses at the hospital didn't want him to leave with the baby, and they said he hurt them when they tried to stop him. Douglas is in trouble with the law for what happened, but a separate investigation said he did not abuse the baby. Now, his lawyer hopes that this finding will help him with his other legal troubles. People are still talking about what happened and trying to figure out what's right and wrong in this case."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who used instruments of the continuo group as independent parts? , can you please find it?   Bach's early cantatas are Choralkonzerte (chorale concertos) in the style of the 17th century, different from the recitative and aria cantata format associated with Neumeister that Bach started to use for church cantatas in 1714. Wolff points out the relation of Bach's early cantatas to works by Dieterich Buxtehude, with whom Bach had studied in Lübeck. Christ lag in Todes Banden shows similarities to a composition of Johann Pachelbel based on the same Easter chorale. Although there is no evidence that Bach and Pachelbel met, Bach grew up in Thuringia while Pachelbel was based in the same region, and Bach's elder brother and teacher Johann Christoph Bach studied with Pachelbel in Erfurt. Another of Pachelbel's works appears to be referenced in the early Bach cantata, Nach dir, Herr, verlanget mich, BWV 150, and there has been recent speculation that Bach wanted to pay tribute to Pachelbel after his death in 1706.The texts for the early cantatas were drawn mostly from biblical passages and hymns. Features characteristic of his later cantatas, such as recitatives and arias on contemporary poetry, were not yet present, although Bach may have heard them in oratorios by Buxtehude, or even earlier. Instead, these early cantatas include 17th-century elements such as motets and chorale concertos. They often begin with an instrumental sinfonia or sonata (sonatina). The following table lists the seven extant works composed by Bach until 1708, when he moved on to the Weimar court. Bach uses the limited types of instruments at his disposal for unusual combinations, such as two recorders and two viole da gamba in the funeral cantata Gottes Zeit ist die allerbeste Zeit, also known as Actus Tragicus. He uses instruments of the continuo group as independent parts, such as a cello in Nach dir, Herr, verlanget mich and a bassoon in Der Herr denket an uns. The cantata for the inauguration of a town council is richly scored for trumpets, woodwinds and strings. Wolff notes: The overall degree of mastery by which these early...

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. When can a person's death not be wanted by the person? Choose the most suitable option to answer the above question. Options：  A. cyanide  B. love  C. burial  D. suicide  E. murder The answer to this question is:","output":"E. murder A person's death may not be wanted by the person themselves in the case of murder. Murder is the unlawful killing of another human being with malicious intent or premeditation. In this scenario, the victim has no control over their own death, and it is not something they would typically desire or choose for themselves. The act of murder is a heinous and immoral action which often brings immense grief, pain, and loss to the victim's loved ones. Society views murder as a reprehensible criminal act, and laws exist to deter and punish the perpetrators. To further understand the given options, let's break them down: A. Cyanide: Cyanide is a highly toxic chemical compound that can cause death if ingested or inhaled in large enough quantities. While it is true that a person would not want exposure to such a dangerous substance, this particular option does not specifically indicate that their death would not be wanted by the person themselves. B. Love: Love is an intense and heartfelt emotion that we typically associate with positive feelings, such as happiness, devotion, and companionship. Although love can sometimes lead to tragic circumstances, the emotion itself does not pertain to an unwanted, untimely death. C. Burial: Burial is a traditional method of disposing of a person's remains after their death. While the process of burial relates to death, it does not imply that the person's death was unwanted or forced upon them. D. Suicide: Suicide is the act of intentionally causing one's own death. Even though it is a tragic and distressing event, it is a deliberate choice made by the individual, which suggests that the person's death is not entirely \\"unwanted\\" by them in this particular moment. However, this does not mean that the action of suicide is justifiable or encouraged. E. Murder: As mentioned earlier, murder is the unlawful killing of a person without their consent, which makes it the most suitable option for answering the question. In the case of murder, the victim's death is unwanted and forced upon them, evoking feelings of anger, sadness, and injustice amongst their loved ones and the wider community."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Although some lipids in the diet are essential, excess dietary lipids can be harmful. Because lipids are very high in energy, eating too many may lead to unhealthy weight gain. A high-fat diet may also increase lipid levels in the blood. This, in turn, can increase the risk for health problems such as cardiovascular disease. The dietary lipids of most concern are saturated fatty acids, trans fats, and cholesterol. For example, cholesterol is the lipid mainly responsible for narrowing arteries and causing the disease atherosclerosis.  Ronaldo and Jeff are two college roommates that have similar body structure and similar physical activity levels. Ronaldo is a nutrition enthusiast and eats a diet with appropriately low amounts of fat and cholesterol. Jeff, on the other hand, doesn't really care about nutrition at all. He eats whatever he wants, whenever he wants, and as a result he consumes a diet with an inappropriately high amount of fat and cholesterol.  Who is less likely to gain unhealthy amounts of weight? Answer:","output":"Ronaldo is less likely to gain unhealthy amounts of weight compared to Jeff. This is because Ronaldo is paying close attention to his nutrition and consuming a diet with appropriately low amounts of fat and cholesterol, while Jeff consumes a diet with an inappropriately high amount of fat and cholesterol. Lipids, also known as fats, play a critical role in maintaining the overall health of the body. They supply energy, support cell growth, protect organs, and help in the absorption of certain vitamins. However, as mentioned in the question prompt, consuming excessive amounts of dietary lipids can lead to undesirable health outcomes, including unhealthy weight gain. The fact that Ronaldo is a nutrition enthusiast means that he is likely maintaining a balanced diet, with a proper proportion of macronutrients (carbohydrates, proteins, and fats) and micronutrients (vitamins and minerals). As a result, he is consuming sufficient energy to support his daily activities without leading to an energy surplus in his body. This energy balance reduces the chances of significant weight gain due to the accumulation of excess body fat. On the other hand, Jeff's diet, which is high in fat and cholesterol, is associated with a higher calorie intake. Given that lipids are the most calorie-dense macronutrient, providing 9 calories per gram compared to 4 calories per gram for carbohydrates and proteins, Jeff's dietary choices make it more likely for him to consume excessive amounts of energy. If he is unable to burn these excess calories through physical activity, his body will store the extra energy as fat, leading to unhealthy weight gain over time. Furthermore, Jeff's high intake of saturated fatty acids, trans fats, and cholesterol can contribute to an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases, such as atherosclerosis, directly linked to the narrowing of arteries due to cholesterol deposits. Additionally, the two roommates have a similar body structure and physical activity levels, implying that their energy requirements are relatively similar. Since Ronaldo's diet is more focused on providing the right balance of nutrients without excess, it is safe to conclude that Ronaldo is less likely to gain unhealthy amounts of weight compared to Jeff."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Cheryl talks her friend Kathy into going with her and they skip class to go see the film.

Several of those speaking condemned the media for ignoring the stories of the victims and praised Trump and Vice President Mike Pence for their attention to border security. Crime assertion Trump, in his remarks, also suggested those illegally in the United States commit more crimes on a statistical basis than citizens or resident aliens. However, studies have shown that undocumented immigrants are less likely to commit a crime in the U.S. than native-born citizens, including one published by the libertarian CATO Institute this year. Following intense domestic and international condemnation, Trump on Wednesday signed an order ending his administration's practice of separation of children from their families while parents were being prosecuted for crossing the border illegally.

Chapter IX of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran sets forth the qualifications for presidential candidates and procedures for election, as well as the President's powers and responsibilities as \\"functions of the executive\\". These include signing treaties and other agreements with foreign countries and international organizations; administering national planning, budget, and state employment affairs; and appointing ministers subject to the approval of Parliament. However, in reality the president mainly gets the blame for failures than actually making the decisions. The current long-time Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei, who has been ruling for nearly three decades, has been issuing decrees and making the final decisions on economy, environment, foreign policy, national planning such as population growth, and everything else in Iran. Khamenei also makes the final decisions on the amount of transparency in elections in Iran, and has fired and reinstated Presidential cabinet appointments.   - Rafsanjan (also Romanized as Rafsanjn and Rafsinjn; also known as Bahrmbd) is a city in and the capital of Rafsanjan County, Kerman Province, Iran.

It is the world's second-largest religion and the fastest-growing major religion in the world, with over 1.7 billion followers or 23% of the global population, known as Muslims. Islam is an Abrahamic monotheistic religion that upholds that God is one and incomparable and that the purpose of existence is to worship God. Muslims consider Muhammad to be the last prophet of God.  - The Indian Ocean is the third largest of the world's oceanic divisions, covering (approximately 20% of the water on the Earth's surface). It is bounded by Asia on the north, on the west by Africa, on the east by Australia, and on the south by the Southern Ocean or, depending on definition, by Antarctica. It is named after the country of India. The Indian Ocean is known as \\"Ratnkara\\", \\"\\"the mine of gems\\"\\" in ancient Sanskrit literature, and as \\"Hind Mahsgar\\", \\"\\"the great Indian sea\\"\\", in Hindi.  - Tehran ( \\"Tehrn\\") is the capital of Iran and Tehran Province. With a population of around 9 million in the city and 16 million in the wider metropolitan area, Tehran is the most populous city of Iran, the 2nd-most populous city in Western Asia and the 3rd-largest metropolitan area in the Middle East. It is ranked 29th in the world by the population of its metropolitan area.  - Sayyed Ali Hosseini Khamenei (; 19 April 1939) is the second and current Supreme Leader of Iran and a Muslim cleric. Ali Khamenei succeeded Ruhollah Khomeini, the leader of the Iranian Revolution, after Khomeini's death, being elected as the new Supreme Leader by the Assembly of Experts on 4 June 1989, at age 49. Current Iranian president Hassan Rouhani arranged for Khamenei to get his first major post in the provisional revolutionary government as deputy defense minister. Khamenei also served as the President of Iran from 1981 to 1989. In 2012, 2013, and 2014 \\"Forbes\\" selected him 21st, 23rd, and 19th, respectively, in the list of \\"The World's Most Powerful People\\".  - Azerbaijan, officially the Republic of Azerbaijan, is a country in the South Caucasus region, situated at the crossroads of Southwest Asia and Southeastern Europe. It is bounded by the Caspian Sea to the east, Russia to the north, Georgia to the northwest, Armenia to the west and Iran to the south. The exclave of Nakhchivan is bounded by Armenia to the north and east, Iran to the south and west, while having an 8 km border with Turkey in the north west.  - The Iranian presidential election of 1989 took place on July 28 , 1989 , after the death of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and the selection of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , the previous President of Iran , as the new Supreme Leader of Iran . Out of the seventy - nine candidates registered to run , only two were approved by the Council of Guardians , which resulted in a very predictable win by Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani , the previous Speaker of Majlis .  - Iran (, also , ; ' ), also known as Persia, officially the Islamic Republic of Iran (' ), is a sovereign state in Western Asia. It is bordered to the northwest by Armenia, the \\"de facto\\" Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, and Azerbaijan; to the north by the Caspian Sea; to the northeast by Turkmenistan; to the east by Afghanistan and Pakistan; to the south by the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Oman; and to the west by Turkey and Iraq. Comprising a land area of , it is the second-largest country in the Middle East and the 18th-largest in the world. With 82.8 million inhabitants, Iran is the world's 17th-most-populous country. It is the only country with both a Caspian Sea and an Indian Ocean coastline. The country's central location in Eurasia and Western Asia, and its proximity to the Strait of Hormuz, make it of great geostrategic importance. Tehran is the country's capital and largest city, as well as its leading economic center.  - The Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran was adopted by referendum on 2 and 3 December 1979, and went into force replacing the Constitution of 1905. It was amended on 28 July 1989. The constitution has been called a \\"hybrid\\" of \\"theocratic and democratic elements\\". While articles One and Two vest sovereignty in God, article six \\"mandates popular elections for the presidency and the Majlis, or parliament.\\" However all democratic procedures and rights are subordinate to the Guardian Council and the Supreme Leader, whose powers are spelled out in Chapter Eight (Articles 107-112).  - Head of government is a generic term used for either the highest or second highest official in the executive branch of a sovereign state, a federated state, or a self-governing colony, (commonly referred to as countries, nations or nation-states) who often presides over a cabinet, a group of ministers or secretaries who lead executive departments. The term \\"head of government\\" is often differentiated from the term \\"head of state\\", (e.g. as in article 7 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, article 1 of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Crimes against Internationally Protected Persons, including Diplomatic Agents and the United Nations protocol list), as they may be separate positions, individuals, and/or roles depending on the country.  - Pakistan (or ), officially the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, is a federal parliamentary republic in South Asia on crossroads of Central Asia and Western Asia. It is the sixth-most populous country with a population exceeding 200 million people. It is the 36th largest country in the world in terms of area with an area covering . Pakistan has a coastline along the Arabian Sea and the Gulf of Oman in the south and is bordered by India to the east, Afghanistan to the west, Iran to the southwest and China in the far northeast respectively. It is separated from Tajikistan by Afghanistan's narrow Wakhan Corridor in the north, and also shares a maritime border with Oman.  - An Islamic republic is the name given to several states in countries ruled by Islamic laws, including the Islamic Republics of Pakistan, Iran, Afghanistan, and Mauritania. Pakistan first adopted the title under the constitution of 1956. Mauritania adopted it on 28 November 1958. Iran adopted it after the 1979 Iranian Revolution that overthrew the Pahlavi dynasty. Afghanistan adopted it in 1992 (in 19962001 the Taliban was ruling as an Islamic emirate (monarchy)) upon Jamiat-e Islami seizing capital Kabul from the Communists. Despite the similar name the countries differ greatly in their governments and laws.  - Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani (or Hashemi Bahramani; 25 August 1934  8 January 2017) was an influential Iranian politician, writer and one of the founding fathers of the Islamic Republic who was the fourth President of Iran from 3 August 1989 until 3 August 1997. He was the head of the Assembly of Experts from 2007 until 2011 when he decided not to nominate himself for the post. He was also the chairman of the Expediency Discernment Council.  - The Assembly of Experts (also Assembly of Experts of the Leadership) of the Islamic Republic of Iran, also translated as Council of Experts, is a deliberative body of Iran consisting of eighty eight (88) Mujtahids (Islamic theologians) that is charged with electing and removing the Supreme Leader of Iran and supervising his activities. Members of the assembly are elected from lists of candidates by direct public vote for eight-year terms. The number of members has ranged from 82 elected in 1982 to 88 elected in 2016. Current laws require the assembly to meet for at least two days every six months. The current chairman of the Fifth Assembly is Ahmad Jannati. All candidates to the Assembly of Experts, the President and the Majlis (Parliament), must be approved by the Guardian Council, while half of its members are selected by the Supreme Leader of Iran. Accordingly, the Assembly has never questioned the Supreme Leader. There have been instances when the current Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei publicly criticized members of the Assembly of Experts, resulting in their arrest and dismissal. For example, Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei publicly called then-member of the Assembly of Experts Ahmad Azari Qomi a traitor, resulting in Ahmad Azari Qomi's arrest and eventual dismissal from the Assembly of Experts.  - The Expediency Discernment Council of the System (\\"Majma' Tašxis Malahat Nezâm\\") is an administrative assembly appointed by the Supreme Leader and was created upon the revision to the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran on 6 February 1988. It was originally set up to resolve differences or conflicts between the Majlis and the Guardian Council, but \\"its true power lies more in its advisory role to the Supreme Leader.\\" According to Hooman Majd, the Leader \\"delegated some of his own authority to the council  granting it supervisory powers over all branches of the government\\"  following President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's election in 2005.  - A head of state (or chief of state) is the public persona that officially represents the national unity and legitimacy of a sovereign state. In developing the current Constitution of France (1958), former French president Charles de Gaulle said the head of state should embody \\"the spirit of the nation\\" (\\"\\"). In some countries, typically those with parliamentary governments, the head of state is a ceremonial figurehead that does not actually guide day-to-day government activities and may not even be empowered to exercise any kind of political authority (e.g., Queen Elizabeth II in the United Kingdom). In other countries, the head of state is also the head of government, such as in the U.S., where the president is both a public figurehead and the actual highest ranking political leader who, in practice, oversees the executive branch.  - Iraq (, or ; '; '), officially known as the Republic of Iraq ('; ') is a country in Western Asia, bordered by Turkey to the north, Iran to the east, Kuwait to the southeast, Saudi Arabia to the south, Jordan to the southwest, and Syria to the west. The capital, and largest city, is Baghdad. The main ethnic groups are Arabs and Kurds; others include Assyrians, Turkmen, Shabakis, Yazidis, Armenians, Mandeans, Circassians, and Kawliya. Around 95% of the country's 36 million citizens are Muslims, with Christianity, Yarsan, Yezidism, and Mandeanism also present. The official languages of Iraq are Arabic and Kurdish.

Please answer a question about the following article about Queen (band): In 1963, the teenage Brian May and his father custom-built his signature guitar Red Special, which was purposely designed to feedback. Sonic experimentation figured heavily in Queen's songs. A distinctive characteristic of Queen's music are the vocal harmonies which are usually composed of the voices of May, Mercury, and Taylor best heard on the studio albums A Night at the Opera and A Day at the Races. Some of the ground work for the development of this sound can be attributed to their former producer Roy Thomas Baker, and their engineer Mike Stone. Besides vocal harmonies, Queen were also known for multi-tracking voices to imitate the sound of a large choir through overdubs. For instance, according to Brian May, there are over 180 vocal overdubs in \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\".

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given the question: Question: Why wouldn't someone want to work in an office? Options: - blisters - frustration - being paid - making shareholders richer - making money  Explain why a human would choose \\"frustration\\" to answer the question above: The answer is:","output":"\\"Frustration,\\" because people may experience several types of frustration at the office that could influence their desire not to work in such an environment. Firstly, frustration in an office setting could stem from several sources and may significantly impact an employee's job satisfaction and overall wellbeing. Here are a few reasons why working in an office can lead to frustration. 1. Hierarchical Bureaucracy: Traditionally, offices operate in a hierarchical structure, where decisions flow from the top down. This structure can frustrate employees who feel their voices, ideas, and concerns are not heard, valued, or acted upon. When there is little room for democratic decision-making or freedom of expression, employees may feel frustrated and become disengaged. 2. Lack of Autonomy: Lack of freedom and control over one's work can result in frustration. In an office, you often have to follow strict schedules, protocols, procedures, and may not get to choose the type of projects you work on, or how you want to execute them. 3. Office Politics: For many people, office politics can be draining and frustrating. It can create a negative atmosphere filled with rivalry, gossip, unfair treatment, favoritism, and power battles. It can tip the balance from meritocracy towards who can better play the political game. 4. Communication Problems: Miscommunication or lack of communication can lead to confusion, followed by frustration. In office environments, information may not always be effectively shared, which can lead to misunderstandings and mistakes. 5. Micro-Management: Excessive micro-management often leads to frustrated employees in an office environment. Feeling constantly watched and judged can stifle creativity, initiative, and can increase stress levels. 6. Commuting: The time spent commuting back and forth can add to daily frustrations, especially for those living in large cities where traffic is a significant stressor. 7. Confinement: Being seated at a desk, in a cubicle, or in a small office for long hours can become boring and frustrate workers. It can negatively influence their physical health and motivation.     In contrast, the other options \\"- blisters,\\" \\"being paid,\\" \\"making shareholders richer,\\" and \\"making money\\" are less likely to be chosen as the main reasons someone would not want to work in an office. Blisters are not a common ailment resulting from office work. Meanwhile, \\"being paid\\" and \\"making money\\" are typically considered benefits of working, not drawbacks. Although one could argue that \\"making shareholders richer\\" might cause annoyance if one values a more equitable distribution of wealth, it is not a primary source of frustration directly tied to the physical and mental day-to-day reality of the office environment. In conclusion, frustration is the most fitting answer as it encapsulates a diverse range of common pain points workers experience in office settings."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In this case, \\"UN\\", \\"Carla del Ponte\\", \\"Mladic\\", and \\"Andrija Ilic\\" should not be translated. Step 3: Translating individual words and phrases - I will translate important words and phrases:   - chief prosecutor (başsavcı)   - has insisted that (ısrarla belirtti)   - is in (bulunmaktadır)   - Serbia (Sırbistan) Step 4: Composing the translated sentence - With all those components translated, I can now compose the translated Turkish sentence: \\"UN Başsavcısı Carla del Ponte (orta) ısrarla belirtti ki Mladic Sırbistan'da bulunmaktadır. [Andrija Ilic]\\" Step 5: Checking the translation for accuracy - My final step is to reread the translated sentence in Turkish and ensure that it conveys the same meaning as the original sentence, with all necessary information included. The translation appears accurate, so I will submit it as the final translated sentence."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Some fortunate people can go on a diet, lose the excess fat and then simply get on with their lives. Others get stuck in the eternal cycle of wanting to be thin, dieting, craving, bingeing, regaining the weight and then wanting to be thin again. You want to break free from this exhausting and depressing merry-go-round of losing and regaining weight but you’re not ready to give up doing what you know best. Let’s examine the diet cycle mentality. THERE IS A MAGIC CURE The reason you haven’t lost weight and kept it off is because you haven’t found the right diet that suits you particular physical and emotional needs. You need to eat more carbs, or more fat, you need to cycle your calories or have cleaner re-feeds, and you need a coach for accountability. Once you figure out precisely what the optimum formula is for you and you have an expert to help you then you will lose weight and keep it off. ONE LAST DIET Once you lose the weight, then you will learn how to get in tune with your body’s hunger signals and eat mindfully. You just need to commit totally to this last diet, get to your goal and then you will stop for good. YOU LOVE HEALTH AND FITNESS You really enjoy being in control of your food and planning your training regime. Time spent scouring the latest fitness magazines and entering your weight into a spreadsheet is fun and rewarding. You spend most of your waking hours plotting and planning how you are going to burn that fat! I WANT TO BREAK FREE!! The only way to break free from the diet cycle is to come to the place where you no longer believe the stories you tell yourself. If there was a magic cure that worked for you, you or someone else would have found it by now. Count the number of diet books on your bookshelf, the e-books on your computer and the magazines on the coffee table.  Have any of them given you permanent weight loss? What happens after you break free from the diet cycle?  A. not enough information  B. You burn more fat  C. You no longer believe the unhealthy diet stories and body images you tell yourself  D. You continue to carve to be thin","output":"C. You no longer believe the unhealthy diet stories and body images you tell yourself Breaking free from the diet cycle mentality involves changing your mindset and rejecting the common myths and misconceptions that are often associated with dieting and weight loss. By understanding that there is no \\"magic cure\\" or \\"one last diet\\" that guarantees permanent weight loss, you can start to focus on developing a healthier relationship with food and exercise. This involves listening to your body's hunger signals, eating mindfully, and engaging in physical activities you genuinely enjoy, rather than obsessing over calorie intake and workout routines.  Once you break free from the diet cycle, you will no longer be trapped in the constant loop of losing and regaining weight, and will instead be able to create long-term, sustainable habits that promote a healthier lifestyle. This shift in mindset can help improve your overall mental and emotional well-being, while also contributing to a more stable and positive body image."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Like sentinels, they sprouted in a line from the barn, swerved north of the stream, veered at a right angle for the stump, and followed Justin to where he stood. The cross-beams remained, after which he'd finally be done. He took a white handkerchief from his shirt pocket and wiped his forehead. The task had been lengthened considerably, although Justin refused to admit it, by incessant thinking, an activity which often stopped him with his hammer in mid-air. But now, he would soon be able to think all he wanted from the comfort of his porch as the cattle wandered from shade to shade. After he bought some cattle, he reminded himself. Under the entirely blue vault of sky, Justin felt something pass between himself and the morning sun. His leathered face turned up to see nothing but ubiquitous light, curving toward him in all directions. He arched his aging back, feeling the popping and hating it more than usual, before wiping his neck and replacing the handkerchief. He had that feeling that he'd better drink something and sit down or he'd end up in that damn hospital again. Twice last year, whether he needed it or not, he went in for a check-up, and twice a year, some intern treated him like the village idiot. Truth be told, everyone who knew about him had treated him that way for nearly eleven years, except his niece.

Movie title: We Were Soldiers Context: A French Army unit is on patrol in pre-Vietnam IndoChina in July 1954 during the First Indochina War. The captain of the patrol curses the land when they see nothing. Then, the unit is suddenly ambushed by hundreds of Vietminh soldiers who kill the officers and, although the unit kills many Vietminh, it is eventually overrun. One Vietminh officer, Nguyen Huu An (Duong Don), hypothesizing that if they take no prisoners the French will eventually stop sending troops, orders the execution of all surviving French soldiers.Eleven years later, Lieutenant Colonel Hal Moore (Mel Gibson), a dedicated U.S. soldier, is deeply committed to training his troops, who are preparing to be sent to Vietnam. The night before their departure, the unit's officers hold a party to celebrate. Moore learns from a superior officer that his unit will be known as the 1st Battalion / 7th cavalry regiment. He is disquieted because the 7th Cavalry regiment was the unit commanded by General George Custer in the 19th Century when he and his men were slaughtered at the Battle of the Little Bighorn in 1876. Moore is also dismayed because President Lyndon B. Johnson has decreed that the war would be fought \\"on the cheap,\\" without declaring it a national emergency. As a result, Moore believes he will be deprived of his oldest, best-trained soldiers (a formal declaration of war would have meant mobilization and extension of the terms of enlistment for volunteer soldiers) - about 25% of his battalion - just prior to shipping out for Vietnam. Before leaving for Vietnam, Moore delivers a touching speech to his unit:\\"Look around you, in the 7th Cavalry,we got a Captain from the Ukraine, another from Puerto Rico, we got Japanese, Chinese, Blacks, Hispanics, Cherokee Indian, Jews and Gentiles, all American.

The Saudi Arabian government believes they can and is backing its belief by investing 22 billion into a public transport mega-project in the capital Riyadh. Set to begin construction early next year, a new metro network will encompass over 176 km (110 miles) of train lines and 85 stations, linking the city center to universities, the airport, a newly built financial district and commercial areas. The first trains as slated to run in 2019. During construction, it will be the world's biggest public transport project, employing tens of thousands of people, developers say. According to the High Commission for the Development of Arriyadh, all carriages will be air-conditioned and divided into first, family and single class. Buses and trains take a distant second to personal cars in Riyadh and according to FCC Construction only 2% of commuters in the Saudi Arabian capital take public transport. It's no surprise because gasoline is highly subsidized -- a gallon at the petrol pumps costs around 0.50. According to Bloomberg, the world's largest oil producer ranks only second to Venezuela for the world's cheapest gasoline. According to reports, the Saudi government is weighing up increasingly the cost of fuel to give public transport a boost. Read more: Ramadan's Super Bowl effect.

Cheever, a two-time World Series of Poker Champion. Huck is a regular in Vegas poker rooms but needs 10,000 to get a seat in the World Series of Poker Main Event.

It may sound strange, but an egg can do wonders for your hair. The yolk nourishes your hair by adding moisture so that it doesn't look dull. The white clarifies your hair by helping to remove any buildup. The egg also has protein in it, which strengthens your hair. The result is hair that looks very shiny after just one treatment. Here's how to do it:  Beat one egg in a small bowl. Wet your hair. Pour the egg over your head. Use a wide-tooth comb to comb it to the tips of your hair. Let it sit in your hair for at least 15 minutes. Shampoo your hair as normal. Rinse with cold water for maximum shine. Apple cider vinegar is quickly catching on as an all-natural hair conditioner and gloss booster. It balances your hair's pH level, clarifies your strands and leaves your hair feeling soft. Once your hair dries, it will no longer smell like vinegar. Follow these steps to make an ACV treatment:  Shampoo your hair as usual, but skip the conditioner. Pour a mixture of 1 tablespoon ACV and 1 tablespoon water over your head. Comb it through to your tips. Very long hair may require 2 or 3 tablespoons. Let it sit for five minutes, then rinse your hair with cold water at the end of your shower. Avocado has natural fats that nourish your hair and add shine. Using a ripe avocado will make it easier to spread the mixture into your hair. Try an avocado mask when your hair is dry and in need of a moisturizing boost.  Mash an avocado until smooth. You can also use a blender to process it. Wet your hair. Spread the avocado from your roots to your tips. Let it sit in your hair for at least 15 minutes. Shampoo your hair as normal. Rinse with cold water. Honey attracts moisture and has clarifying properties. This combination makes it perfect for adding shine to dull hair. Raw honey is the most nourishing, but any type of honey works fine. To make a honey mask,  Mix 1/4 cup honey and 1/4 cup warm water. Wet your hair. Comb the mixture into your hair. Let it sit for 15 minutes or more. Shampoo your hair as normal. Rinse with cold water. If your hair isn't shiny because it's dry, dull and frizzy, a deep conditioning treatment should put things right. You can get a store-bought deep conditioner or make your own using coconut or olive oil. Once a week, follow these steps to deep condition your hair:  Wet your hair. Comb 1 to 3 tablespoons of coconut oil or olive oil from your roots to your tips. Cover your hair with a shower cap or plastic wrap. Let it sit for up to 30 minutes. Shampoo your hair. You may need to wash it two or three times to remove the oily residue. Rinse with cold water.","output":"This article highlights various natural treatments, including egg, apple cider vinegar, avocado, honey, and deep conditioning, to enhance hair shine and nourishment."},{"instruction":"Q: In this task, you are given a sentence in the Bulgarian language.

If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\". By the time of the Uruk period (c. 4100–2900 BC calibrated), the volume of trade goods transported along the canals and rivers of southern Mesopotamia facilitated the rise of many large, stratified, temple-centered cities (with populations of over 10,000 people) where centralized administrations employed specialized workers. It is fairly certain that it was during the Uruk period that Sumerian cities began to make use of slave labor captured from the hill country, and there is ample evidence for captured slaves as workers in the earliest texts. Artifacts, and even colonies of this Uruk civilization have been found over a wide area—from the Taurus Mountains in Turkey, to the Mediterranean Sea in the west, and as far east as central Iran.

Born in Carlton, England, on March 8, 1905, Nicholls held the position of goal keeper, renowned for his considerable height of 6 feet 4 inches, which was instrumental in his career on the playing field. His early career is marked with some blanks, but his first recorded professional engagement was with Darlaston, with the number of matches he played there remaining unknown. After this, Nicholls moved on to Northfleet United, where the number of matches he played also goes unreported.  The later parts of his career were more well-documented. In 1936, he joined Tottenham Hotspur, where he played for three years until 1939. During his stint with Tottenham Hotspur, he made an impressive 124 appearances. After his tenure with Tottenham Hotspur, Nicholls switched alliances to Bristol Rovers. With Bristol Rovers, he made 112 appearances, showing a consistent show of skill and resilience that undoubtedly made him a distinguished goalkeeper of his time. Despite his active career in football, Nicholls was not known for scoring goals; he maintained a record of zero goals throughout his professional life. This was likely due to his position on the playing field. Nicholls lived until the age of 68, passing away on June 20, 1973, in Nottingham, England. Throughout his life, he made significant contributions to British football, both through his individual performance and through his participation in some of the most recognized football clubs in the country."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: Abstract: BACKGROUND A major challenge for physicians is to identify patients with acute coronary syndromes who may benefit from treatment with glycoprotein-IIb/IIIa-receptor antagonists. We investigated whether troponin concentrations can be used to stratify patients for benefit from treatment with tirofiban.     METHODS We enrolled 2222 patients of the Platelet Receptor Inhibition in Ischemic Syndrome Management study with coronary artery disease and who had had chest pain in the previous 24 h. All patients received aspirin and were randomly assigned treatment with tirofiban or heparin. We took baseline measurements of troponin I and troponin T. We recorded death, myocardial infarction, or recurrent ischaemia after 48 h infusion treatment and at 7 days and 30 days.     FINDINGS 629 (28.3%) patients had troponin I concentrations higher than the diagnostic threshold of 1.0 microg/L and 644 (29.0%) troponin T concentrations higher than 0.1 microg/L. 30-day event rates (death, myocardial infarction) were 13.0% for troponin-I-positive patients compared with 4.9% for troponin-I-negative patients (p<0.0001), and 13.7% compared wth 3.5% for troponin T (p<0.001). At 30 days, in troponin-I-positive patients, tirofiban had lowered the risk of death (adjusted hazard ratio 0.25 [95% CI 0.09-0.68], p=0.004) and myocardial infarction (0.37 [0.16-0.84], p=0.01). This benefit was seen in medically managed patients (0.30 [0.10-0.84], p=0.004) and those undergoing revascularisation (0.37 [0.15-0.93] p=0.02) after 48 h infusion treatment. By contrast, no treatment effect was seen for troponin-I-negative patients. Similar benefits were seen for troponin-T-positive patients.     INTERPRETATION Troponin I and troponin T reliably identified high-risk patients with acute coronary syndromes, managed medically and by revascularisation, who would benefit from tirofiban..

His primary objective was to move forces successfully into Tunisia, and intending to facilitate that objective, he gave his support to François Darlan as High Commissioner in North Africa, despite Darlan's previous high offices of state in Vichy France and his continued role as commander-in-chief of the French armed forces. The Allied leaders were \\"thunderstruck\\" by this from a political standpoint, though none of them had offered Eisenhower guidance with the problem in the course of planning the operation.

Eisenhower later appointed General Henri Giraud as High Commissioner, who had been installed by the Allies as Darlan's commander-in-chief, and who had refused to postpone the execution. Who initially served as High Commissioner of North Africa? What is the answer?

Darlan was chosen by Eisenhower despite his prior high offices within Vichy France and his concurrent role as the commander-in-chief of the French armed forces.

(August 2014) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) The story follows the escape of two men from an Alaska prison, the efforts of a railroad dispatch office to safely stop the out-of-control train they are on, and the hunt by their warden to recapture them. Oscar \\"Manny\\" Manheim is a ruthless bank robber and hero to the convicts of Stonehaven Maximum Security Prison. After two previous escape attempts, the doors to Manny's cell were welded shut for three years. A court order compels Manny's nemesis, the vindictive and sadistic Associate Warden Ranken, to release him back into the general prison population. Manny intends to break out a third time with his older brother Jonah, but he is forced to set his escape plan into action in the middle of winter after Ranken employs a serial killer to stab him. Jonah stabs his attacker to death in retaliation and in turn is severely beaten by a prison guard, leaving him in a high-security hospital wing. Manny has to leave his brother behind. He recruits Buck McGeehy, who was convicted of statutory rape and who works in the prison's laundry room, to smuggle him out in a trolley. Buck decides to join Manny in the escape, even though Manny wants to go it alone. After a freezing cross-country hike (involving a 300Â ft drop into a river and subsequent swim) the two hop on board a train consisting of four locomotives at a remote Alaskan rail yard. Both men enter the fourth unit and stow away in the toilet compartment. Just as the train starts to move, the elderly engineer suffers a heart attack. In attempting to stop the train and get off, he does not set the throttle to idle, instead engaging the brakes, before collapsing off the still-moving train.

Input: Abstract: Limited neural input results in muscle weakness in neuromuscular disease because of a reduction in the density of muscle innervation, the rate of neuromuscular junction activation or the efficiency of synaptic transmission. We developed a small-molecule fast-skeletal-troponin activator, CK-2017357, as a means to increase muscle strength by amplifying the response of muscle when neural input is otherwise diminished secondary to neuromuscular disease. Binding selectively to the fast-skeletal-troponin complex, CK-2017357 slows the rate of calcium release from troponin C and sensitizes muscle to calcium. As a consequence, the force-calcium relationship of muscle fibers shifts leftwards, as does the force-frequency relationship of a nerve-muscle pair, so that CK-2017357 increases the production of muscle force in situ at sub-maximal nerve stimulation rates. Notably, we show that sensitization of the fast-skeletal-troponin complex to calcium improves muscle force and grip strength immediately after administration of single doses of CK-2017357 in a model of the neuromuscular disease myasthenia gravis. Troponin activation may provide a new therapeutic approach to improve physical activity in diseases where neuromuscular function is compromised..

Don't expect an emotional story of guilt, retribution and despair from \\"Scarface\\". This is a tale of ferocious greed, corruption, and power. The darker side of the fabled \\"American Dream\\". Anybody complaining about the \\"cheesiness\\" of this film is missing the point. The superficial characters, cheesy music, and dated fashions further fuel the criticism of this life of diabolical excess. Nothing in the lives of these characters really matter, not on any human level at least. In fact the film practically borderlines satire, ironic considering all the gangsta rappers that were positively inspired by the lifestyle of Tony Montana. This isn't Brian DePalma's strongest directorial effort, it is occasionally excellent and well-handled (particularly the memorable finale), but frequently sinks to sloppy and misled. Thankfully, it is supported by a very strong script by Oliver Stone (probably good therapy for him, considering the coke habit he was tackling at the time). The themes are consistent, with the focus primarily on the life of Tony Montana, and the evolution of his character as he is consumed by greed and power. The dialogue is also excellent, see-sawing comfortably between humour and drama. There are many stand-out lines, which have since wormed their way into popular culture in one form or another. The cast help make it what it is as well, but this is really Pacino's film. One of his earlier less subtle performances (something much more common from him nowadays), this is a world entirely separate from Michael Corleone and Frank Serpico. Yet he is as watchable here as ever, in very entertaining (and intentionally over-the-top) form. It is hard to imagine another Tony Montana after seeing this film, in possibly one of the most mimicked performances ever. Pfeiffer stood out as dull and uncomfortable on first viewing, but I've come to realize how she plays out the part of the bored little wife. Not an exceptional effort, but unfairly misjudged. The supporting players are very good too, particularly Paul Shenar as the suave Alejandro Sosa. Powerful, occasionally humorous, sometimes shocking, and continually controversial. \\"Scarface\\" is one of the films of the eighties (whatever that might mean to you).

Q:A friend asked me to answer this question: What was developed by the federal government as a segregated community?, using the article: The Clinton Engineer Works (CEW) was the production installation of the Manhattan Project that during World War II produced the enriched uranium used in the 1945 bombing of Hiroshima, as well as the first examples of reactor-produced plutonium. It consisted of production facilities arranged at three major sites, various utilities including a power plant, and the town of Oak Ridge. It was in East Tennessee, about 18 miles (29 km) west of Knoxville, and was named after the town of Clinton, eight miles (13 km) to the north. The production facilities were mainly in Roane County, and the northern part of the site was in Anderson County. The Manhattan District Engineer, Kenneth Nichols, moved the Manhattan District headquarters from Manhattan to Oak Ridge in August 1943. During the war, Clinton's advanced research was managed for the government by the University of Chicago. Construction workers were housed in a community known as Happy Valley. Built by the Army Corps of Engineers in 1943, this temporary community housed 15,000 people. The township of Oak Ridge was established to house the production staff. The operating force peaked at 50,000 workers just after the end of the war. The construction labor force peaked at 75,000 and the combined employment peak was 80,000.

Context: The first reinforcement to the Teutonic forces arrived in early 1261, but was wiped out on January 21, 1261 by Herkus Monte in the Battle of Pokarwis. In January 1262 reinforcements arrived from the Rhineland, led by Wilhelm VII, Duke of Jülich, who was obliged by Pope Alexander IV to fulfil his crusader duties in Prussia. This army broke the Siege of Königsberg but as soon as the army returned home, the Sambians resumed the siege and were reinforced by Herkus Monte and his Natangians. Herkus was later injured and the Natangians retreated, leaving the Sambians unable to stop supplies reaching the castle and the siege eventually failed. Prussians were more successful capturing castles deeper into the Prussian territory , and the Knights were left only with strongholds in Balga, Elbing, Culm, Thorn, and Königsberg. Most castles fell in 1262-1263, and Bartenstein fell in 1264. The Prussians destroyed captured forts instead of using them for their own defence, so the end of successful sieges meant that large Prussian forces did not have to stay near their home and were then free to operate in other parts of Prussia, raiding the Culmerland and Kuyavia. A recovered Herkus Monte raided Culmerland with a large force and took many prisoners in 1263. On his way back to Natangia, Herkus and his men were confronted by a contingent of their enemies. In the Battle of Löbau that ensued, Prussians killed forty knights, including the Master and the Marshal. The Prussians also received help from Lithuanians and Sudovians. In summer of 1262 Treniota and Shvarn attacked Masovia, killing Duke Siemowit I, and raided Culmerland, provoking Pogesanians to join the uprising. However, assassination of Mindaugas and subsequent dynastic fights prevented Lithuanians from further campaigns. Skalmantas, leader of Sudovians, raided Culm  in 1263 and in 1265. Question: Who raided Cumberland and Kuyavia? Answer:","output":"Herkus Monte, a Prussian leader, raided Culmerland (not Cumberland) and Kuyavia with a large force in 1263.

The answer to this question is:","output":"The solid body electric guitar that the Gibson Robot Guitar was based on was introduced in the early 1950s. To provide a comprehensive understanding of the origins and development of both the solid body electric guitar and the Gibson Robot Guitar, let's explore the historical context and innovations that led to these instruments. The solid body electric guitar can be largely attributed to inventor and musician, Les Paul. In the late 1940s, Les Paul experimented with a solid body design built from a wooden plank with strings and a rudimentary pickup. This creation, often referred to as the \\"Log,\\" laid the foundation for the solid body electric guitar. The fundamental principle of the solid body was to diminish the effects of resonance, which would reduce feedback and improve the guitar's overall performance. After a few years of designing and refining the concept, the Gibson Guitar Corporation, an iconic American guitar manufacturer, approached Les Paul to collaborate on producing a line of solid body electric guitars. In 1952, the Gibson Les Paul Model was introduced, which had a single-cutaway mahogany body, a carved maple top, and two P-90 pickups. It is considered one of the first solid body electric guitars that gained mainstream popularity. The Gibson Les Paul marked the beginning of the evolution of the solid body electric guitar. Other models, such as the Fender Telecaster (1950) and the Fender Stratocaster (1954), soon followed, further expanding the realm of electric guitars and transforming the music industry. Fast forward to 2007, the Gibson Robot Guitar was developed as an adaptation of the classic Gibson Les Paul. This innovation brought in cutting-edge technology to the already well-established solid body electric guitar. The Gibson Robot Guitar incorporated next-generation features, such as automatic tuning and intonation adjustment, bringing a new level of precision and ease of use to guitar players. In conclusion, the solid body electric guitar was introduced in the early 1950s, with the Gibson Les Paul Model being one of the key pioneers which eventually led to the development of the Gibson Robot Guitar. This impressive fusion of traditional solid body electric guitar design and modern technological advancements revolutionized the way musicians interact with their instruments and establish new standards for performance and convenience."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

He convinces Drake to waive the credit check in exchange for a list of personal references and an upfront payment of the first six months' rent, to be paid by wire transfer. Before any of this money is paid, however, Hayes arrives unannounced one morning and shuts himself into the apartment. As days pass, Drake and Patty grow increasingly impatient when Hayes' wire transfer fails to materialize. From inside the apartment, sounds of loud hammering and drilling are heard at all hours of the day and night, however the door is seldom answered. When Drake finally makes an attempt to enter Hayes' apartment, he finds that the locks have been changed. Drake attempts to put an end to the constant noise and drive out Hayes by cutting the electricity and heat to the apartment, but Hayes summons the police, who side with Hayes and warn Drake that his actions are unlawful and could result in a civil suit. Drake and Patty hire a lawyer, Stephanie MacDonald (Laurie Metcalf). However, the case to evict Hayes is thwarted by Drake's earlier attempt to disconnect the utilities. Hayes, safe from eviction for the time being, deliberately infests the house with cockroaches, which prompts the Watanabes to move out and... My question: What was the expensive car Hayes drive?

Campaigners set up camp at Upton, near Chester, in April 2014 to prevent testing by energy company IGas. In November, they were served with a court order compelling them to leave the site. Cheshire Police said two men had been arrested for \\"obstructing police\\" and another for \\"obstructing the highway\\". A man and woman were arrested for obstructing a high court officer, while another man was arrested for \\"failing to comply with a Section 35 notice\\", a spokeswoman said. Another man was arrested for police assault, another for aggravated trespass. She added that more than 20 dispersal notices had been issued. The BBC's Cheshire political reporter Phil McCann said about 30 protesters had been at the camp but all protesters had been evicted. Supporters had entered an adjacent field but bailiffs ushered them out and police escorted them away. Camp resident Phil Whyte, who was there since the day it was set up, said he had left of his own accord, because he was \\"cold, tired and worried about my cat\\". Bailiffs, supported by police from Cheshire and North Wales, arrived at the site at about 10:00 GMT to begin the eviction process. A woman was treated at the scene by paramedics at 12:28 GMT and declined to be taken to hospital, according to a spokesperson for the North West Ambulance Service. For the first two hours, there was a stand-off between the bailiffs, police and protesters - then we saw the first arrest as a man was carried horizontally through a field. After seven hours of action the camp was quiet by 17:00 GMT, when the last of the protesters was taken down. He was arrested, but many others left of their own free will. It's clear the campers didn't manage to resist for as long as they may have hoped, but their 20-month stay is meant to serve as a serious deterrent to any companies wanted to frack. A Cheshire Police spokeswoman said the force expected a \\"protracted\\" operation and closed Duttons Lane, which leads to the camp. She added that officers were \\"monitoring the situation and ensuring public safety\\". Since being served the eviction notice, the protesters constructed an elaborate series of fortifications, including a network of tunnels, walls and a moat to try to prevent their removal. Frack Free Dee Coalition said protesters would take \\"peaceful direct action\\" and would do \\"everything we can to defend ourselves\\". Member Anna Davies said her group's position had not changed. \\"We are resisting - we will resist,\\" she said. An IGas spokesman said the company \\"respect the right to peaceful protest, [but] these protesters are trespassing as determined by the High Court\\". The planning permission for IGas to run tests at the site runs out on 28 May. This article was about:","output":"In a place called Upton, near Chester, some people called campaigners set up a camp in 2014 to stop a company called IGas from testing the land for energy. The campaigners didn't want the company to do something called fracking, which they believe is not good for the environment. In November, the people in the camp were told by a court that they had to leave. Recently, the police came to the camp to help make sure everyone left. Some people didn't want to go and they were arrested, while others left by themselves. The police also gave out notices telling people they needed to go. By the end of the day, all the people had left the camp. Even though the camp is now empty, the campaigners hope that their long stay will make other companies think twice before they want to do fracking. The IGas company still has permission to test the land, but only until May 28th."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Answer:","output":"The former professional footballer you are referring to is David Beckham, for whom the Spanish Tax Decree, also known as \\"Beckham Tax Law\\" or \\"Beckham Law,\\" was nicknamed. The law, officially called Royal Decree 687/2005, was established in Spain in 2005 as a tax incentive for foreign workers temporarily residing in Spain. It allowed them to pay taxes at a lower rate than Spanish residents, providing a significant benefit for high-income individuals such as professional footballers. David Beckham is an iconic English footballer who played as a midfielder for clubs like Manchester United, Real Madrid, LA Galaxy, and Paris Saint-Germain, as well as for the England national team. He is known for his exceptional free-kick skills, accurate crosses, and bending shots. Beckham joined the Spanish football club Real Madrid from Manchester United in 2003, and this Spanish tax law was introduced in 2005. His name became associated with the tax law since he was one of the first signatories of the deal and received significant media attention for taking advantage of it. This linked the tax law to Beckham in the public's mind and it eventually became popularly known as the \\"Beckham Law.\\" David Beckham retired from professional football in 2013. His last club was Paris Saint-Germain, where he played for a brief period from January to May 2013. He announced his retirement on May 16, 2013, and played his last professional game on May 18th of the same year.

Answer:","output":"Arenaria and Sciadopitys verticillata are not part of the same family. In order to understand their taxonomic differences, it is essential to delve deeper into their classifications. Arenaria, commonly known as sandworts, is a genus of flowering plants belonging to the Caryophyllaceae family. This family falls under the order Caryophyllales. The Caryophyllaceae family comprises herbaceous plants characterized by opposite, simple leaves and small, usually white or pink flowers that form a cyme or solitary inflorescence. The genus Arenaria encompasses roughly 90 to 100 species and is mostly native to temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. Some well-known species in this genus include Arenaria montana, Arenaria serpyllifolia, and Arenaria rubra. On the other hand, Sciadopitys verticillata, commonly known as the Japanese umbrella pine or kōyamaki, is the only species in the genus Sciadopitys, which belongs to the family Sciadopityaceae. This family is under the order Pinales, which is a group of gymnosperms. The Sciadopityaceae family is characterized by distinctive whorls of evergreen, needle-like foliage. The Japanese umbrella pine is endemic to Japan, where it grows in moist, cool regions at higher elevations. It has unique characteristics, such as growing bifacially flattened shoots with leaves arranged in an umbrella-like pattern, which is the reason behind its common name. As previously mentioned, Arenaria belongs to the Caryophyllaceae family within the order Caryophyllales, while Sciadopitys verticillata is in the family Sciadopityaceae under the order Pinales. These two families belong to two different orders, and the plants themselves exhibit significantly different characteristics. For example, the Caryophyllaceae family (Arenaria) consists of herbaceous, flowering plants that typically produce small flowers. These plants are mostly found in the temperate zones of the Northern Hemisphere. In contrast, the Sciadopityaceae family (Sciadopitys verticillata) has gymnosperm characteristics with evergreen foliage and is native to Japan. In summary, Arenaria and Sciadopitys verticillata are not part of the same family. They belong to the families Caryophyllaceae and Sciadopityaceae, respectively, which are classified under distinct orders and possess various features that differentiate them from each other."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Ray pretended to consult his admission log, just as he always did. The nightly hospital call meant one of three things: the chemical dependency floor was full (highly unlikely), the individual in question had fallen under the hospital's \\"one treatment episode every three months\\" sanction (also known as the Black List, and only moderately unlikely), or the prospective client had no insurance (in Ray's experience, very likely). The folks at the hospital knew, as did Ray, that federal law prohibited him from turning away individuals requesting detoxification services if he had an open bed. The hospital was generous enough to spring for a cab voucher for the intoxicate. In Ray's experience as well, overnight admissions were less interested in detox than in free food, a free bed and complimentary meds. For his two hour paperwork investment and aggravation, he would receive the benefit of knowing the client slept until noon then slipped out the side door and into another binge. Any bills for service generated for the brief stay would return in a week or so stamped \\"No Such Address\\" or simply \\"Return to Sender\\". On average, the clients of addictions services managed to muster a raging 25% of them who would ever pay a dime toward their bill. The night shift admission payment percentages were a quarter of that quarter in good years. Thus, the frequent calls from the hospital. They had little better luck in getting good addresses (or even with those, a client who stayed sober long enough to give a shit). No one relished treating the uninsured and uninsurable. It was fiscal suicide. The hospital was perfectly willing to let the local experts in deadbeats handle the workload. Tonight, Ray could tell them no.

Movie title: Pleasantville Context: David (Tobey Maguire) and Jennifer (Reese Witherspoon) are twins and attend the same high school. Jennifer is concerned mainly with her appearance, relationships and popularity, while David watches a lot of television, has few friends, and is socially awkward. Their mother (Jane Kaczmarek) leaves Jennifer and David alone at home while she heads out of town for a rendezvous with her younger boyfriend. The twins begin to fight over the use of the downstairs TV; Jennifer wants to watch an MTV concert with her date, Mark Davis, while David hopes to watch a marathon of his favorite show, Pleasantville.Pleasantville is a black-and-white '50s sitcom, a cross between Leave It to Beaver and Father Knows Best that centers around the idyllic Parker family George (William H. Macy), his wife Betty (Joan Allen), and their two children, Bud and Mary Sue. David is an expert on every episode and wants to watch the marathon so he can win a 1,000 trivia contest. During the fight between David and Jennifer, the remote control breaks and the TV cannot be turned on manually. A mysterious TV repairman (Don Knotts) shows up uninvited, and quizzes David on Pleasantville before giving him a strange-looking, retro-styled remote control. The repairman leaves, and David and Jennifer promptly resume fighting. However, through some mechanism of the remote control, they are transported into the television, ending up in the Parkers' black and white Pleasantville living room. David tries to reason with the repairman (who communicates with him through the Parkers' TV set) but succeeds only in chasing him away. David and Jennifer must now pretend they are, respectively, Bud and Mary Sue Parker.Jennifer is dismayed to be stranded, but she and David begin exposing the town to issues such as sex, personal freedoms, styles of art, and literature.

Q:\\"That's Glenn Miller,\\" my father said. \\"But it can't be.\\" He had the back of the hospital bed cranked upright, the lower lid of his left eye creeping up in a warning signal I'd learned to recognize as a child. My older sister Ann had settled deep in the recliner, and she glared at me too, blaming me for winding him up. The jam box sat on the rolling tray table and my father was working the remote as he talked, backing up my newly burned CD and letting it spin forward to play a few seconds of low fidelity trombone solo. \\"You know the tune, of course,\\" he said. \\"'King Porter Stomp.'\\" Those childhood years of listening to him play Glenn Miller on the console phonograph were finally paying off. \\"He muffed the notes the same way on the Victor version.\\" \\"So why can't it be Miller?\\" I asked. \\"He wouldn't have played with a rabble like that.\\" The backup musicians teetered on the edge of chaos, playing with an abandon somewhere between Dixieland and bebop. \\"They sound drunk.\\" My father had a major emotional investment in Miller. He and my mother had danced to the Miller band at Glen Island Casino on Long Island Sound in the summer of 1942, when they were both sixteen. That signature sound of clarinet and four saxes was forever tied up for him with first love and the early, idealistic months of the war. But there was a better reason why it couldn't have been Miller playing that solo. If the date on the original recording was correct, he was supposed to have died three days earlier.

Answer:","output":"Karel Kachyňa was the director who was more politically motivated. Karel Kachyňa (1924-2004) was a Czech film director from the former Czechoslovakia. He was well-known for his works that often touched on political and social issues in his home country. His films often depicted the impact of social and political changes on ordinary people's lives. Some of his most renowned films include \\"A Report on the Party and Guests\\" (1966), \\"The Ear\\" (1970), and \\"The Little Shepherd Boy from the Valley\\" (1984). These films made pointed commentary on the political repression and totalitarianism in the Eastern Bloc countries during the mid- to late twentieth century. On the other hand, Richard Pearce is an American director and cinematographer who has directed films, TV episodes, and documentaries. Born in 1943, he is known for making narrative-driven movies that explore family-related issues, musical history, and human relationships. Some of his works include \\"Country\\" (1984), \\"The Long Walk Home\\" (1990), and \\"Leap of Faith\\" (1992). While his works may contain social and political elements, Pearce's focus does not revolve solely around political motivation as Karel Kachyňa's does."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: Which process involves solvent separation on a solid medium?   Choices:  - substration  - resonance  - affinity  - chromatography  A: A:","output":"The process that involves solvent separation on a solid medium is chromatography. Chromatography is an analytical technique widely used in scientific research, forensics, biotechnology, and other industries to separate mixtures of substances based on their different properties, such as polarity or molecular weight. The term \\"chromatography\\" derives from the Greek words \\"chroma\\" (meaning \\"color\\") and \\"graphein\\" (meaning \\"to write\\"), as the first chromatographic separations were based on color bands formed by colored compounds on solid support. In chromatography, the mixture to be separated is dissolved in a suitable solvent, called the mobile phase, while a stationary phase made of a solid or viscous liquid immobilized on a solid medium is used for the separation itself. The separation occurs when there are differences in the affinity between different components in the mixture for the stationary phase and the mobile phase. Compounds with greater affinity for the stationary phase will be retained longer, and thus move more slowly through the medium. In contrast, compounds with a higher affinity for the mobile phase will travel more quickly and thus separate from other components. There are various types of chromatographic techniques, each employing different stationary and mobile phases, as well as separation methods: 1. Thin-layer chromatography (TLC): Involves the use of a solid stationary phase (usually a thin layer of silica gel, alumina, or cellulose) coated on a glass, plastic, or aluminum plate, and a liquid mobile phase. 2. Column chromatography: The stationary phase is typically a solid support (e.g., silica or alumina) packed within a glass or plastic column, and the mobile phase is a liquid that flows through the column. 3. Gas chromatography (GC): The stationary phase is a polymer or a solid that is coated on the inner walls of a narrow-capillary column or supported on a solid-support material, and the mobile phase is a carrier gas (such as helium or nitrogen) that flows through the column. 4. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC): Similar to column chromatography but with the use of high pressure to force the mobile phase (a liquid) through a column packed with small particles of the stationary phase, which allows the separation of compounds with higher resolution and speed. 5. Ion-exchange chromatography: A type of column chromatography that separates ions based on their charge and affinity for the ion-exchange resin (stationary phase) that has charged functional groups. 6. Size-exclusion chromatography (SEC): Also known as gel filtration, this type of column chromatography separates molecules based on their size and shape, using a porous stationary phase that allows smaller molecules to enter pores and larger molecules to be excluded from the pores. 7. Affinity chromatography: A selective type of column chromatography that exploits the specific interactions between molecules and a ligand immobilized on the stationary phase (e.g., antibody-antigen, enzyme-substrate, or receptor-ligand interactions) for the separation and purification of target molecules. In summary, the process involving solvent separation on a solid medium is chromatography, an analytical technique employed in various scientific fields to separate and analyze different components in complex mixtures. Several chromatographic methods exist, each tailored to specific types of compounds and separation needs."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q:What is the final step of the following process: -  Living organisms in the sea die - The matter forms on the sea floor - Layers of sediment form above the matter compressing it - After many years the matter is compressed and heated A:","output":"The final step in this process is the formation of fossil fuels, specifically oil or natural gas, as a result of the accumulation, compression, and transformation of organic matter from dead sea organisms.  To elaborate, the entire process can be broken down into the following steps: 1. Death and accumulation of sea organisms: The process starts with the natural death of marine organisms such as plankton, algae, and other small sea creatures. These organisms get deposited on the seafloor after their death and accumulate over time. 2. Sedimentation: As more and more organic matter accumulates on the seafloor, layers of sediment (such as sand, silt, and clay) begin to form above it. This sedimentation process can occur over a long period, encompassing millions of years. 3. Compression: As layers of sediment continue to accumulate, the weight of the overlying material increases. This increase in weight, along with the natural geological processes occurring deep within the Earth, causes the organic matter and sediment layers to experience immense pressure, leading to their compression. 4. Heat and transformation: The immense pressure and the natural heat produced by the Earth's interior result in a gradual rise in temperature within these deeply buried layers. This increase in temperature, combined with the pressure, causes the organic matter to undergo a series of chemical reactions. These reactions break down the complex organic molecules into simpler compounds, such as hydrocarbons. 5. Formation of fossil fuels: The final step of this process is the formation of fossil fuels, specifically oil and natural gas, which are both primarily composed of hydrocarbons. Over time, these hydrocarbons migrate to different regions, creating reservoirs of fossil fuels. The type of fossil fuel formed – whether oil or natural gas – depends on the specific conditions (temperature, pressure, and composition of the organic matter) during the compression and transformation processes. In summary, the final step of the process involving the death and deposition of sea organisms, sedimentation, compression, and heating is the formation of fossil fuels, specifically oil or natural gas. These fossil fuels constitute a significant source of energy and have played a crucial role in the growth and development of human civilization throughout history. However, the extraction and burning of these finite resources contribute to environmental concerns, such as air pollution and climate change, necessitating a transition to more sustainable energy sources."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Since the 1920s jazz age, jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression. It emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African American and European American musical parentage with a performance orientation. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime, as well as European military band music. Although the foundation of jazz is deeply rooted within the Black experience of the United States, different cultures have contributed their own experience and styles to the art form as well. Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as \\"one of America's original art forms\\".  - William \\"Bill\\" Kreutzmann, Jr. (born May 7, 1946) is an American drummer.

RatDog's repertoire consisted of more than 150 songs.  - Digital Audio Tape (DAT or R-DAT) is a signal recording and playback medium developed by Sony and introduced in 1987. In appearance it is similar to a Compact Cassette, using 3.81 mm / 0.15\\" (commonly referred to as 4 mm) magnetic tape enclosed in a protective shell, but is roughly half the size at 73 mm × 54 mm × 10.5 mm. As the name suggests, the recording is digital rather than analog. DAT has the ability to record at higher, equal or lower sampling rates than a CD (48, 44.1 or 32 kHz sampling rate respectively) at 16 bits quantization. If a digital source is copied then the DAT will produce an exact clone, unlike other digital media such as Digital Compact Cassette or non-Hi-MD MiniDisc, both of which use a lossy data reduction system.  - Ween is an American alternative rock band formed in New Hope, Pennsylvania, in 1984 by childhood friends Aaron Freeman and Mickey Melchiondo, better known by their respective stage names, Gene Ween and Dean Ween. After meeting in a middle-school typing class, the two began playing music and immediately chose the name Ween as well as their Ramones-inspired pseudonyms. Ween performed as a duo backed by a Digital Audio Tape for the band's first ten years of existence before expanding to a four- (and later five-) piece act. The band's highest charting single is \\"Push th' Little Daisies\\", which was a hit in the United States and Australia.  - Concord (;) is the largest city in Contra Costa County, California.

The city is a major regional suburban East Bay center within the San Francisco Bay Area, and is east of San Francisco.  - The guitar is a musical instrument classified as a string instrument with anywhere from four to 18 strings, usually having six. The sound is projected either acoustically, using a hollow wooden or plastic and wood box (for an acoustic guitar), or through electrical amplifier and a speaker (for an electric guitar). It is typically played by strumming or plucking the strings with the fingers, thumb and/or fingernails of the right hand or with a pick while fretting (or pressing against the frets) the strings with the fingers of the left hand. The guitar is a type of chordophone, traditionally constructed from wood and strung with either gut, nylon or steel strings and distinguished from other chordophones by its construction and tuning. The modern guitar was preceded by the gittern, the vihuela, the four-course Renaissance guitar, and the five-course baroque guitar, all of which contributed to the development of the modern six-string instrument.  - The City of New York, often called New York City or simply New York, is the most populous city in the United States. With an estimated 2015 population of 8,550,405 distributed over a land area of just , New York City is also the most densely populated major city in the United States. Located at the southern tip of the state of New York, the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area, one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world. A global power city, New York City exerts a significant impact upon commerce, finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education, and entertainment, its fast pace defining the term \\"New York minute\\". Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an important center for international diplomacy and has been described as the cultural and financial capital of the world.  - Reggae is a music genre that originated in Jamaica in the late 1960s. The term also denotes the modern popular music of Jamaica and its diaspora. A 1968 single by Toots and the Maytals \\"Do the Reggay\\" was the first popular song to use the word \\"reggae,\\" effectively naming the genre and introducing it to a global audience. While sometimes used in a broad sense to refer to most types of popular Jamaican dance music, the term \\"reggae\\" more properly denotes a particular music style that was strongly influenced by traditional mento as well as American jazz and rhythm and blues, especially the New Orleans R&B practiced by Fats Domino and Allen Toussaint, and evolved out of the earlier genres ska and rocksteady. Reggae usually relates news, social gossip, and political comment. Reggae spread into a commercialized jazz field, being known first as Rudie Blues, then Ska, later Blue Beat, and Rock Steady. It is instantly recognizable from the counterpoint between the bass and drum downbeat, and the offbeat rhythm section. The immediate origins of reggae were in ska and rock steady; from the latter, reggae took over the use of the bass as a percussion instrument.

Paragraph: Hundreds of thousands of years before China was to become the world's longest-running civilization, the prologue was enacted by means of the flicker of a carefully tended fire. Peking Man, a forebear of Homo sapiens, achieved a mastery of fire. We might call it the first Chinese invention. Not that he devised flint and steel, matches, or any other way of creating fire. Peking Man simply learned how to capture flame, perhaps from a forest fire, and keep it alight. He thus enjoyed two revolutionary luxuries: light and heat. Technologically and sociologically, it was a phenomenal breakthrough: with fire, communities could live year 'round in one cave, in which cooking and even smelting could be pursued. And so, by 600,000 b.c., about 50 km (31 miles) southwest of present-day Beijing, the ancestors of mankind were ready to settle down. Several hundred thousand years later, when Marco Polo reached the capital of China, he was astonished by a further development in fire technology. The Chinese, he announced, used black stones dug out of mountains as fuel. Europeans did not yet have a word for \\"coal,\\" nor had they discovered a use for it. The First Dynasty The confluence of mythology and history in China took place around 4,000 years ago during what is referred to as the Xia (Hsia) Dynasty. This was still the Stone Age, but the people are thought to have made silk from thread produced by the worms they cultivated on the leaves of their mulberry trees. And written language (which evolved as early as 4,500 to 5,000 years ago) was already in use, originally by oracles and then by official scribes — China's first scholars. During the second of the quasi-legendary dynasties, the Shang (from about the 16th to 11th centuries b.c.), the Chinese developed an interest in art. Careful geometric designs as well as dragon and bird motifs adorned bowls and implements. And with the arrival of the Bronze Age, the Chinese created bronze vessels of such beauty and originality that, until modern times, archaeologists refused to believe they were cast 3,000 years ago. The Shang Dynasty gave rise to the concept of one Chinese nation under one government.  Question: \\"Which Chinese dynasty is associated with careful geometric designs as well as dragon and bird motifs?\\" Answer: \\"Shang\\" Based on the paragraph, is this answer correct","output":"Yes, the answer \\"Shang\\" is correct based on the paragraph. It is mentioned that during the second of the quasi-legendary dynasties, the Shang (from about the 16th to 11th centuries b.c.), the Chinese developed an interest in art.

Your job is follow the instructions as faithfully as you can. While answering think step-by-step and justify your answer. In this task you are expected to provide an SQL statement from an english description of what that SQL statement does. The description may include multiple steps but you should only ouput one SQL statement that accomplishes every step. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \\"SELECT\\" statement. Next, you use a \\"FROM\\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \\"AS\\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \\"AS\\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \\"JOIN\\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \\"ON\\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \\"WHERE\\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \\"GROUP BY\\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \\"HAVING\\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \\"ORDER BY\\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \\"DESC\\" statement will sort in descending order and the \\"ASC\\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \\"LIMIT\\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \\"*\\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1.

Worldwide, a girl born in 2012 can expect to live to 73 and a boy can expect to live to 68, according to a new report from the World Health Organisation. This is six years longer than the average global life expectancy for a child born in 1990. Across the globe, life expectancies are increasing with the highest male life expectancy being in Iceland - 81 - and the highest female life expectancy being in Japan - 87. At the top end of the scale, Japanese women have the highest female life expectancy in the world at 87, and Iceland has the highest male life expectancy – 81. The next highest female life expectancies were in Spain (85), Switzerland (85), Singapore (85) and Italy (also 85). After Iceland, the highest male life expectancies were found in Switzerland (80), Australia (80), Israel (80), and Singapore (also 80). In the UK, life expectancy for a boy born in 2012 is 79 and for a girl it is 83. In the U.S. a boy born in 2012 can expect to live to 76 and a girl can expect to reach 81. If all high-income countries are taken together, the average male life expectancy is now 76. This is 16 years more than for a boy born in a low-income country, where life expectancy is now 60. Globally, the leading causes of lost years of life due to premature death are heart disease, lower respiratory infections - such as pneumonia - and strokes. Worldwide, a girl born in 2012 can expect to live to 73 and a boy can expect to live to 68 but life expectancies in low-income countries remain much lower than those in high-income countries. For a girl born in 2012 in a high-income country, life expectancy is 82. For a girl born in a low-income country, the figure is just 63. ‘In high-income countries, much of the gain in life expectancy is due to success in tackling non-communicable diseases [i.e. chronic diseases such as heart disease and diabetes],’ said Dr Ties Boerma, Director of the Department of Health Statistics and Information Systems at WHO. ‘Fewer men and women are dying before they get to their 60th birthday from heart disease and stroke. ‘Richer countries have become better at monitoring and managing high blood pressure for example.’ Declining tobacco use is also a key factor in helping people live longer in several countries. However, the ‘World Health Statistics 2014’ report shows that the greatest progress was made in low-income countries where average life expectancy increased by nine years between 1990 and 2012. In many low-income countries female life expectancy is still held back by high rates of death during childbirth. And the greatest increases in life expectancy were in Liberia (from 42 years in 1990 to 62 years in 2012), Ethiopia (from 45 to 64 years), the Maldives (58 to 77 years), Cambodia (54 to 72 years), Timor-Leste (50 to 66 years) and Rwanda (48 to 65 years). ‘An important reason why global life expectancy has improved so much is that fewer children are dying before their fifth birthday,’ says Dr Margaret Chan, WHO Director-General. ‘But there is still a major rich-poor divide - people in high-income countries continue to have a much better chance of living longer than people in low-income countries.’ The figures also revealed that across the world women live longer than men. In high-income countries they live for an average of six years longer, and in low-income countries they live for an average of three years longer. At the bottom end of the scale, life expectancy for both men and women is still less than 55 years in nine sub-Saharan African countries – Angola, Central African Republic, Chad, Côte d’Ivoire, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Lesotho, Mozambique, Nigeria and Sierra Leone. One of the reasons that life expectancies have increased in low-income countries is that infant mortality rates fell significantly between 1990 and 2012. The WHO figures also revealed that the top three causes of years of life lost due to premature death are coronary heart disease, lower respiratory infections – such as pneumonia – and strokes. However, globally, the greatest causes of death vary. In 22 African countries 70 per cent or more of the years of life lost due to premature death are caused by infectious diseases. In contrast, in 47 mostly high-income countries, non-communicable diseases and injuries cause more than 90 per cent of years lost. These are diseases that cannot be passed between people, such as cancer and heart disease. More than 100 countries are transitioning rapidly towards a greater proportion of deaths from non-communicable diseases and injuries. Most deaths in children under the age of five occur as a result of premature birth. The second highest cause of infant mortality is pneumonia. What are highlight points for this article?","output":"This article focuses on the improvements in life expectancy across the globe, with Iceland and Japan boasting the oldest citizens. The World Health Organisation reports that a girl born in 2012 can expect to live to 73, and a boy can expect to live to 68, six years longer than the global life expectancy for a child born in 1990. The highest male life expectancy exists in Iceland (81) and the highest female life expectancy in Japan (87). The article also mentions that life expectancies in low-income countries remain much lower than high-income ones, and progress made in tackling non-communicable diseases, such as heart disease and diabetes, contribute to these gains in life expectancy. Notably, declining tobacco use is a key factor in helping people live longer in several countries. Lastly, this report states that women live longer than men on average across the world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: You are given a new situation: James' father unfortunately had Huntington's disease. This is a disease that can be passed down from generation to generation. His mother Got cancer at one point but it has been treated and has been eliminated.  and a hint : Once again, a mutation is the change in the DNA or RNA sequence. In multicellular organisms, mutations can be subdivided into germline mutations and somatic mutations. Germline mutations occur in the DNA of sex cells, or gametes, and are therefore potentially very serious. These mutations can be passed to the next generation. If the zygote contains the mutation, every cell in the resulting organism will have that mutation. If the mutation results in a disease phenotype, the mutation causes what is called a hereditary disease. Somatic mutations , which occur in somatic, or body, cells, cannot be passed to the next generation (offspring). Mutations present in a somatic cell of an organism will be present (by DNA replication and mitosis) in all descendants of that cell. If the mutation is present in a gene that is not used in that cell type, the mutation may have no effect. On the other hand, the mutation may lead to a serious medical condition such as cancer.  Please answer this question : Given Huntington;s disease can be passed down, is it a mutation in phenotype or body cells? A:","output":"Given that Huntington's disease can be passed down from generation to generation, it is a result of a germline mutation, which occurs in the DNA of sex cells, or gametes. These mutations can be passed to the next generation and affect the entire organism, making it a hereditary disease.

Which is this about? The patent office sided with the Public Patent Foundation, which argued that several examples of so-called  quot;prior art quot; were in existence when Microsoft sought to patent FAT.","output":"This case is about a patent dispute between the Public Patent Foundation (PUBPAT) and Microsoft Corporation regarding the File Allocation Table (FAT) technology, which is a widely-used file system developed by Microsoft. The crux of the argument revolved around the question of whether Microsoft rightfully held an enforceable patent on certain aspects of the FAT file system or if these aspects were already in existence when Microsoft applied for the patent. Background: The File Allocation Table (FAT) is a file system that was initially developed in the 1970s and has subsequently evolved over the years. It is particularly popular for its simplicity and compatibility across a wide range of devices, including personal computers, cameras, and other consumer electronics. Microsoft held several patents for the FAT file system, and one of the most notable among them was the US Patent No. 5,579,517, which covered long-filename (LFN) technology. Dispute: In 2003, PUBPAT filed a request with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) to re-examine the validity of Microsoft's patent on the FAT file system. PUBPAT claimed that the patent in question should not have been granted since there were several instances of \\"prior art\\" in existence at the time Microsoft sought the patent. In the context of intellectual property law, \\"prior art\\" refers to any evidence that demonstrates an invention was already known or publicly disclosed before a patent application was filed. If the presence of prior art can be established, it can be used to invalidate the patent in question. PUBPAT provided numerous examples of documents and technologies dating back to the 1970s and 1980s, asserting that these were evidence of prior art that anticipated the methods and techniques covered by Microsoft's patent. They argued that Microsoft's patent was neither novel nor non-obvious, two essential criteria that must be met for the grant of a patent. Outcome: After re-examining the patent and considering the evidence presented by PUBPAT, the USPTO sided with PUBPAT and invalidated Microsoft's patent. Accepting PUBPAT's arguments that the prior art established sufficient grounds to demonstrate a lack of novelty in Microsoft's technology, the patent office ruled that Microsoft's patent claims were unenforceable. Impact: The decision by the USPTO in this case had several implications. First, it removed legal barriers for developers and manufacturers to implement FAT file system technology freely on their devices without the fear of patent infringement lawsuits. This allowed for greater innovation and competition among device manufacturers, ultimately benefiting consumers. Second, the case illustrated the importance of ensuring that the patent system only protects truly innovative and novel inventions. When a vital technology like the FAT file system is patented and protected, it can stifle innovation and competition in the industry. By challenging and ultimately invalidating Microsoft's patent, PUBPAT showed that the patent system can be used to foster innovation by ensuring that only deserving inventions receive patent protection. Lastly, the case also demonstrated how critical prior art searches and analysis are, both for companies seeking to enforce their patents and organizations like PUBPAT seeking to challenge them. When well-documented prior art can be identified, it can play a significant role in shaping the outcome of a patent dispute and enhance the overall credibility of the intellectual property system."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:What is the first name of the person who army disbanded on December 20?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Stephen F. Austin was commander of the existing unpaid volunteer Texian army, and at his urging the Consultation of 1835 convened in San Felipe de Austin on November 3 of that year. Their creation of a provisional government based on the 1824 constitution established the General Council as a legislative body with each municipality allotted one representative. Henry Smith was elected governor without any clearly defined powers of the position. Sam Houston was in attendance as the elected representative from Nacogdoches, and also served as commander of the Nacogdoches militia.  Edward Burleson replaced Austin as commander of the volunteer army on December 1. On December 10, the General Council called new elections to choose delegates to determine the fate of the region. The Consultation approved the creation of the Provisional Army of Texas, a paid force of 2,500 troops. Houston was named commander-in-chief of the new army and issued a recruitment Proclamation on December 12. The volunteer army under Burleson disbanded on December 20.Harrisburg was designated the seat of a deeply divided provisional government on December 30. Most of the General Council wanted to remain part of Mexico, but with the restoration of the 1824 constitution.  Governor Smith supported the opposing faction who advocated for complete independence. Smith dissolved the General Council on January 10, 1836, but it was unclear if he had the power to do that. He was impeached on January 11.

But they are closely related in a geographic sense and often confused due to their interwoven nomenclature. Santa Ana is a city in Orange County, California. The mailing address for John Wayne Airport is in Santa Ana, hence the IATA airport code SNA. However, the actual physical location of the airport is encompassed by several cities. The entrance is off MacArthur Blvd in Irvine, another city which borders John Wayne Airport to the north and east.

What is the matching principle? What are some examples? What is Matching Principle? What are some examples of it? Please tell me if those questions are the same. Options: 1). no 2). yes","output":"The Matching Principle is an essential concept in accounting that guides the recognition of revenues and expenses for financial reporting purposes. It is based on the accrual accounting method, and it states that expenses should be reported in the same accounting period as the revenues those expenses helped generate. The principle helps ensure that the financial statements provide a more accurate and consistent representation of a company's financial performance during a specific period. By matching expenses with corresponding revenues, the matching principle helps maintain the integrity and comparability of financial statements. There are several examples of the matching principle in practice. Some of the most common include: 1. Cost of Goods Sold (COGS): When a business sells a product, the cost related to producing or acquiring that product must be recorded in the same accounting period as the revenue from the sale. For example, if a company sells a car for 50,000 and the cost to manufacture that car was 40,000, the company recognizes revenue of 50,000 and COGS of 40,000 in the same period, resulting in a gross profit of 10,000. 2. Depreciation and Amortization: Companies typically purchase fixed assets like buildings, machinery, and equipment for use in their operations over a long period. To spread the cost of those assets over their useful life, businesses use depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is used for tangible assets (e.g., buildings, machinery), while amortization is for intangible assets (e.g., patents, copyrights). By allocating a portion of the asset's cost to each period, the matching principle ensures that the expense is recognized in correlation with the revenue generated from the use of that asset. 3. Prepaid Expenses: Some expenses are paid in advance, such as insurance premiums, rent, or subscriptions. These expenses are initially recorded as assets and then gradually expensed over the usage period. For instance, suppose a company pays a 12,000 annual insurance premium in advance. In that case, it will recognize a 1,000 expense each month for 12 months, matching the expense recognition with the passage of time and the benefit received from the insurance coverage. 4. Salaries and Wages: Employees' salaries and wages are expenses that need to be matched with the period in which they were earned. For example, if employees are paid bi-weekly, a company must allocate half of the monthly salary expense to each of the two payment periods. This ensures that the expense matches the period during which labor was provided to generate revenue. 5. Deferred Revenues: When a business receives payment in advance for products or services, it records the payment as a liability called deferred revenue or unearned revenue. As the product is delivered or the service is provided over time, the business recognizes the revenue, matching it to the expense incurred in delivering the service or product, like labor and materials consumed. Regarding your second question, the two sentences are essentially asking the same thing. Both are inquiring about the meaning of the matching principle and requesting examples of its application. Thus, the answer to your question would be option 2: yes, both sentences are essentially the same."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Frustration was a daily part of Robert's life and not Lawrences, since","output":"Robert was a detail-oriented, perfectionist project manager at a prestigious architectural firm, while Lawrence was a carefree, go-with-the-flow artist who had built a name for himself in the world of abstract art. The two had been friends since their college days and happened to share an apartment in the creative district of the city. Robert's frustrations often sprang from the demands of his profession; the tight deadlines, the need for precision, and his unwavering commitment to his job. He would wake up each morning, prepared for the challenges ahead, filled with a volatile combination of excitement and dread. By contrast, Lawrence's days were filled with the freedom to express himself, the liberty to experiment, and the option to take time off without the fear of repercussions. One evening, while sharing a bottle of wine, Robert opened up about his anxieties and the incessant discontent he felt each time he couldn't meet his impeccably high standards. Lawrence listened patiently, waiting for Robert to finish, and said, \\"Life is a canvas, Robert, and you have the power to paint it with the colors of happiness, vibrancy, and peace. It's okay to take a step back and appreciate what you've created.\\" But Robert found it difficult to embrace this philosophy. He believed that success required unwavering commitment, and that letting go, even for a moment, could jeopardize his career. Unable to compromise on his beliefs, Robert allowed the frustration to fester. One day, while presenting his designs to a high-profile client, Robert cracked under the immense pressure. His hands shook and his voice wavered. He struggled to explain the intricate details of the project, and ultimately, lost the account. On the way out, the client, almost in pity, suggested that Robert should take a break and recharge before resuming his work. Crushed and heartbroken, he returned home and informed Lawrence about the incident. The artist could see the toll it had taken on his friend and decided to intervene. He knew that Robert had talent, determination, and the passion for creating incredible designs; but he was allowing stress and frustration to govern his entire existence. Over the next few weeks, Lawrence convinced Robert to undertake a transformative journey. He insisted that Robert optimize his environment at home to create a space for relaxation and creativity, as well as meditation and reflection. They explored various forms of exercise, including yoga and tai chi, to help Robert manage his stress and find a sense of balance. Lawrence also introduced him to the world of abstract art, letting his friend see the beauty in imperfection and the importance of artistic expression. Robert started dedicating time to understanding the emotional aspect of design, broadening his artistic horizons. As weeks turned into months, Robert's demeanor slowly shifted. The once-frustrated man began to find serenity in the small moments of life. He discovered that taking breaks, observing his thoughts, and combating negative self-talk could help him cope with stress more effectively. Lawrence continued to be a supportive influence in Robert's life, patiently guiding him and celebrating his transitions. Ultimately, Robert found his true passion in a more unconventional branch of architecture, fusing together the world of emotions, art, and design. Both their careers soared as their lives found equilibrium. The once-turbulent waters of their existence began to calm, the storms of frustration receding. They discovered and embraced that life is a never-ending, intricate dance between the structured world of work and the unstructured world of expression and self-growth. Robert's transformation became a testament to the fact that embracing vulnerability and seeking balance can set one free from the confines of frustration, paving the way for peace, tranquility, and personal fulfillment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Vietnam War came to an end on April 30, 1975, marked by the fall of Saigon, South Vietnam's capital, to North Vietnamese forces. This conflict followed the First Indochina War and was fought between North Vietnam, supported by its communist allies, and the government of South Vietnam, supported by the United States and other anti-communist countries. The conclusive event was preceded by a series of key events that led to the conclusion of the war.  1. The Paris Peace Accords (January 27, 1973): The United States, South Vietnam, North Vietnam, and the National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam reached a ceasefire agreement to stop hostilities in Vietnam. U.S. military involvement gradually decreased, and eventually, all U.S. troops were withdrawn in March 1973. This left the South Vietnamese Army to defend itself without the direct support of the U.S. military. 2. The Easter Offensive (1972): North Vietnam launched a major offensive against South Vietnam in 1972. Despite initial setbacks, the South Vietnamese army, with U.S. air support, managed to halt the North's invasion. However, the offensive weakened the South Vietnamese Army's capabilities and depleted its resources. 3. Fall of Da Nang (March 1975): The capture of the strategic city of Da Nang by the North Vietnamese Army struck a major blow to South Vietnam's ability to resist, as it prompted a series of military setbacks that eventually led to the fall of Saigon. 4. Fall of Saigon (April 30, 1975): North Vietnamese forces captured the South Vietnamese capital, Saigon, which marked the end of the Vietnam War. The President of South Vietnam, Duong Van Minh, announced an unconditional surrender to the North Vietnamese forces. Saigon was later renamed Ho Chi Minh City in honor of the communist leader. The fall of Saigon marked the reunification of Vietnam under communist rule, which remains in place to this day.

Mutagenic chemicals Given the two facts provided, the answer to the question – \\"what may change the structure of a nucleotide?\\" – is mutagenic chemicals. To properly understand how mutagenic chemicals can change the structure of nucleotides, let’s first explore what nucleotides and mutations are and then discuss the role of mutagenic chemicals in this process. A nucleotide is the basic building block of nucleic acids, which make up the genetic material in living organisms – DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) and RNA (ribonucleic acid). These molecules are composed of three components: a sugar (deoxyribose in DNA or ribose in RNA), a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base. There are four different nitrogenous bases in DNA: adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G), and thymine (T). In RNA, uracil (U) replaces thymine. The specific sequence of these bases in DNA and RNA forms the genetic code that dictates cell functions and the characteristics of the organism. Now let’s explore mutations. A mutation is an alteration in the sequence of nucleotides that occurs spontaneously or as a result of exposure to certain environmental factors (such as mutagenic chemicals). Mutations can be of two types: 1. Chromosomal mutations: These affect the structure of the chromosome itself, changing the arrangement and organization of genes within the chromosomes. Examples include deletions, duplications, inversions, and translocations. 2. Point mutations: These involve a change in a single nucleotide. Examples include substitutions, insertions, and deletions of individual bases. Mutagenic chemicals (Fact 2) are substances that increase the rate of genetic mutations by altering the structure and functionality of nucleotides present in the DNA and RNA molecules. These chemicals can interact with the genetic material either directly or indirectly, causing changes in the nitrogenous bases and the DNA or RNA backbone. The mechanisms by which mutagenic chemicals cause these changes include: 1. Chemical modification of the bases: Mutagenic chemicals can form covalent bonds with the nitrogenous bases, resulting in altered structure and function. For example, alkylating agents can add an alkyl group to the nitrogenous bases, altering the pairing properties and leading to mistakes during DNA replication. 2. Base damage: Some mutagenic chemicals can cause oxidative damage to the nitrogenous bases, for example, through oxidation reactions (Choice 1). These reactions can lead to the formation of unstable and reactive molecules called free radicals, which can, in turn, damage the DNA base pairs. 3. Intercalation: Mutagenic chemicals can insert themselves between adjacent base pairs, causing distortions in DNA or RNA structure. This can lead to problems in processes such as DNA replication, transcription, and translation, potentially causing frameshift mutations. 4. Crosslinking: Certain mutagenic chemicals can form covalent bonds between adjacent bases on the same or opposite DNA strands, leading to the formation of crosslinks that impede replication and transcription processes. In conclusion, the correct answer to the question – \\"what may change the structure of a nucleotide?\\" – is mutagenic chemicals (Choice 5). These chemicals play a significant role in inducing genetic mutations by either altering the structure of entire chromosomes or changing single nucleotides within the DNA and RNA molecules."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

When it comes to evolutionary debates, this one is a major dogfight.      Since the time of Charles Darwin, scientists have argued over the origin of domesticated dogs, speculating wildly about how, when and where a toothy, flesh-eating beast was first transformed into man’s best friend.      Some experts believe humans were naturally drawn to small, furry wolf pups, and seized them as novelties. Others suggest they were raised for slaughter by early agrarian societies.      Yet another theory holds that early proto-dogs were enlisted as helpers by roving bands of hunters, long before humankind ever experimented with agricultural livestock.      “The experts get quite exercised about who’s right and who’s wrong,” said James Serpell, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine. “Whether that’s just scientific hubris, I don’t know.”      But the epic argument over what sparked the Big Bark may finally be drawing to a close. As researchers avail themselves of faster and cheaper DNA sequencing technology, experts are zeroing in on the time and place where dogs were welcomed into human society.      PHOTOS: How wolves became dogs      In research published Thursday in the journal Science, evolutionary biologists analyzed the mitochondrial genomes of 18 ancient dogs and wolves. Then they compared them to an array of modern counterparts, and even a few coyotes.      The authors concluded that dog domestication most likely occurred in Ice Age Europe, between 18,800 and 32,100 years ago -- much earlier, and much farther north, than previously believed.      Dogs, the authors argued, evolved from a now extinct species of European wolf that followed bands of nomadic or semi-nomadic humans who were hunting woolly mammoths and other large prey.      Initially, the wolves sought out the carcasses and scraps of meat left behind by man, the authors suggest. Over time, these hang-around wolves began to fill a special role in human hunter-gatherer society, researchers say.      “The initial interactions were probably at arm’s length, as these were large, aggressive carnivores,” said senior study author Robert Wayne, an evolutionary biology professor at UCLA. “Eventually though, wolves entered the human niche. ... Maybe they even assisted humans in locating prey, or deterred other carnivores from interfering with the hunting activities of humans.”      From Europe, domesticated dogs spread across the Old World, and then to the Americas. However, the robust European wolf that got the fetch ball rolling left no other living descendants besides dogs.      “Wolves living on the planet today are not the closest group to the ancestor of dogs,” Wayne said.      Until recently, many archaeologists and biologists believed that dogs were first domesticated no more than 13,000 years ago, either in East Asia or the Middle East. A burial site in Israel contained the 12,000-year-old remains of an elderly man cradling a puppy. Archaeologists pointed to this find, as well as others, as evidence of a special, ancient bond between dogs and humans.      Yet tracing the exact path of dog evolution has been extremely difficult. Ancient dog remains are hard to distinguish from wolf remains, and frequent interbreeding between dogs and wolves further complicate matters. Add to that mankind’s zealous breeding of the animals to enhance specific traits and behaviors and the genetic waters become very clouded.      In fact, Darwin himself believed that the dizzying variety of existing dog breeds argued strongly that dogs must have had more than one wild ancestor. Genetic researchers today say this is most likely not the case, and that domesticated dogs evolved from one ancestor, in one region.      “On some levels, understanding the geographic origins of dogs is definitely more difficult than studying humans,” said Greger Larson, a bioarchaelogist at the University of Durham in England.      Larson, who was not involved in the Science paper, said Wayne and his colleagues had “significantly advanced” the debate over domestication.“I really like this paper,” Larson said. “Dogs have always been hard to pin down, and there have always been crazy ideas about the process and the location. But the emergence of genetic methods ... has elevated the level of discourse.”      There are those, however, who argue that Wayne and his colleagues are barking up the wrong genetic tree.      Peter Savolainen, an associate professor of evolutionary genetics at Sweden’s Royal Institute of Technology, argues that evidence shows dogs were first domesticated in China, probably as a source of food.      Savolainen points out that Wayne and his colleagues published an earlier paper citing the Middle East as the origin of domestic dogs, but have abandoned that view.      “They don’t comment on that in this paper and they should,” Savolainen said.      He pointed out too that the paper lacks animal samples from the Middle East or China.      “The only thing you’re looking at is European and Russian samples,” he said. “What can you tell really about anything? If you only have European samples, obviously you will find that Europe is the origin.”      Wayne said he and his colleagues did not include samples from those areas because they were too recent, only about 7,000 or 8,000 years old. “That’s well after dogs were domesticated, so we’re kind of limited in that sense,” he said.      As for the turnabout on the Middle East hypothesis, Wayne said it was based on new genetic evidence and the realization that domesticated dogs interbreed with local wolf populations, confusing the genetic signal.      “Initially, we didn’t appreciate how important that early admixture was,” Wayne said.      Study authors said they hope to confirm their findings with additional testing of genetic material. This new DNA will be taken from the nucleus of ancient cells, which contain abundantly more information than DNA taken from cell mitochondria.      In the meantime, experts are left to ponder this latest development, as well as the reason why scientists have argued so heatedly about the origin of dogs.      “You might as well ask why,” Serpell said with a laugh. “People make up tremendously elaborate stories about the origin of our own species based on a few fossil remains here and there, or DNA from this individual or that individual. I guess we’re doing the same thing now to our dogs. ”      ALSO:      What is your dog really saying with a tail wag?

This wolf species was particularly large. Credit: Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences Wolves likely were domesticated by European hunter–gatherers more than 18,000 years ago and gradually evolved into dogs that became household pets, UCLA life scientists report.      \\"We found that instead of recent wolves being closest to domestic dogs, ancient European wolves were directly related to them,\\" said Robert Wayne, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology in UCLA's College of Letters and Science and senior author of the research. \\"This brings the genetic record into agreement with the archaeological record. Europe is where the oldest dogs are found.\\"      The UCLA researchers' genetic analysis is published Nov. 15 in the journal Science and featured on the journal's cover.      In related research last May, Wayne and his colleagues reported at the Biology of Genomes meeting in New York the results of their comparison of the complete nuclear genomes of three recent wolf breeds (from the Middle East, East Asia and Europe), two ancient dog breeds and the boxer dog breed.      \\"We analyzed those six genomes with cutting-edge approaches and found that none of those wolf populations seemed to be closest to domestic dogs,\\" Wayne said. \\"We thought one of them would be, because they represent wolves from the three possible centers of dog domestication, but none was. All the wolves formed their own group, and all the dogs formed another group.\\"      The UCLA biologists also hypothesized at that conference that a now-extinct population of wolves was more directly related to dogs.      For the current study in Science, the researchers studied 10 ancient \\"wolf-like\\" animals and eight \\"dog-like\\" animals, mostly from Europe. These animals were all more than 1,000 years old, most were thousands of years old, and two were more than 30,000 years old.      The biologists studied the mitochondrial DNA of the animals, which is abundant in ancient remains. (Mitochondria are tiny sub-cellular structures with their own small genome.) By comparing this ancient mitochondrial DNA with the modern mitochondrial genomes of 77 domestic dogs, 49 wolves and four coyotes, the researchers determined that the domestic dogs were genetically grouped with ancient wolves or dogs from Europe—not with wolves found anywhere else in the world or even with modern European wolves. Dogs, they concluded, derived from ancient wolves that inhabited Europe and are now extinct.      Wayne said that that the domestication of predatory wolves likely occurred among ancient hunter–gatherer groups rather than as part of humans' development of sedentary, agricultural-based communities.      \\"The wolf is the first domesticated species and the only large carnivore humans ever domesticated,\\" Wayne said. \\"This always seemed odd to me. Other wild species were domesticated in association with the development of agriculture and then needed to exist in close proximity to humans. This would be a difficult position for a large, aggressive predator. But if domestication occurred in association with hunter–gatherers, one can imagine wolves first taking advantage of the carcasses that humans left behind—a natural role for any large carnivore—and then over time moving more closely into the human niche through a co-evolutionary process.\\"      The idea of wolves following hunter–gatherers also helps to explain the eventual genetic divergence that led to the appearance of dogs, he said. Wolves following the migratory patterns of these early human groups would have given up their territoriality and would have been less likely to reproduce with resident territorial wolves. Wayne noted that a group of modern wolves illustrates this process.      The Basenji represents one of the most divergent dog lineages in existence today. Genetic analyses of modern and ancient canids, including some of the oldest known dog remains, place the origin of modern dogs in Europe between 18,800 and 32,100 years ago. Credit: Science      \\"We have an analog of this process today, in the only migratory population of wolves known existing in the tundra and boreal forest of North America,\\" he said. \\"This population follows the barren-ground caribou during their thousand-kilometer migration. When these wolves return from the tundra to the boreal forest during the winter, they do not reproduce with resident wolves there that never migrate. We feel this is a model for domestication and the reproductive divergence of the earliest dogs from wild wolves.      \\"We know also that there were distinct wolf populations existing ten of thousands of years ago,\\" Wayne added. \\"One such wolf, which we call the megafaunal wolf, preyed on large game such as horses, bison and perhaps very young mammoths. Isotope data show that they ate these species, and the dog may have been derived from a wolf similar to these ancient wolves in the late Pleistocene of Europe.\\"      In research published in the journal nature in 2010, Wayne and colleagues reported that dogs seem to share more genetic similarity with living Middle Eastern gray wolves than with any other wolf population, which suggested a Middle East origin for modern dogs. The new genetic data have convinced him otherwise.      \\"When we previously found some similarity between Middle Eastern wolves and domestic dogs, that similarity, we are now able to show, likely was the result of interbreeding between dog and wolves during dog history. It does not necessarily suggest an origin in the Middle East,\\" Wayne said. \\"This alternative hypothesis, in retrospect, is one that we should have considered more closely. As hunter–gatherers moved around the globe, their dogs trailing behind probably interbred with wolves.\\"      Wayne considers the new genetic data \\"persuasive\\" but said they need to be confirmed with an analysis of genetic sequences from the nucleus of the cell (roughly 2 billion base pairs)—a significantly larger sample than that found in mitochondrial DNA (approximately 20,000 base pairs). This is challenging because the nuclear DNA of ancient remains tends to become degraded.      While Wayne plans to pursue this follow-up research, he said he does not expect a nuclear genome analysis to change the central finding. However, he said, it will fill in more of the details.      \\"This is not the end-story in the debate about dog domestication, but I think it is a powerful argument opposing other hypotheses of origin,\\" he said.      There is a scientific debate over when dogs were domesticated and whether it was linked with the development of agriculture fewer than 10,000 years ago, or whether it occurred much earlier. In the new Science research, Wayne and his colleagues estimate that dogs were domesticated between 18,000 and 32,000 years ago.

Thalmann et al. Science, 2013.       ||||| Image caption Some dog-looking remains are more than 30,000 years old      The results of a DNA study suggest that dogs were domesticated in Europe.      No-one doubts that \\"man's best friend\\" is an evolutionary off-shoot of the grey wolf, but scientists have long argued over the precise timing and location for their emergence.      The new research, based on a genetic analysis of ancient and modern dog and wolf samples, points to a European origin at least 18,000 years ago.      Olaf Thalmann and colleagues report the investigation in Science magazine.      It adds a further layer of complexity to the story.      Earlier DNA studies have suggested the modern pooch - in all its shapes and sizes - could track its beginnings back to wolves that attached themselves to human societies in the Middle East or perhaps in East Asia as recently as 15,000 years ago.      The problem with these claims is that palaeontologists have found fossils of distinctly dog-looking animals that are 30,000 years old or more.      Dr Thalmann, from Finland's University of Turku, and his team, have had another go at trying to sort through the conflicting DNA evidence.      They compared genetic sequences from a wide range of ancient animals - both dogs and wolves - with material taken from living canines - again, from both dogs and wolves.      This analysis reveals modern dogs to be most closely related to ancient European wolves or dogs - not to any of the wolf groups from outside Europe, nor even to modern European wolves (suggesting the link is with old European wolves that are now extinct). And because the dog remains used in the research are dated to be more than 18,000 years old, it indicates a timing for domestication that is much older than some researchers have previously argued.      If correct, it means dogs started to diverge from wolf populations when humans had yet to settle into fixed, agricultural communities and were still hunting and gathering.      Image caption The story of how dogs came to be so closely associated with humans is open to debate      It is possible there were wolves that would follow these hunters, may be at a distance at first, living off the scraps and discards from the humans' big-game kills such as mammoth, before eventually being incorporated into the human groups as they became less wary.      \\"You can see how wolves benefitted from living near humans because they got these carcases, but humans too would have benefitted,\\" said Dr Thalmann.      \\"You have to remember that 18,800-32,000 years ago, Europe had much bigger predators than even wolves, such as bears and hyenas. And you can imagine that having wolves living close to you might be a very useful alarm system,\\" he told BBC News. \\"It's a plausible scenario for the origin of the domestication of dogs.\\"      The latest study is unlikely to be the last word on the subject, however.      Using DNA - and the subtle changes it undergoes over time - to examine animal origins and relationships is a very powerful tool, but far from fool-proof.      One of the problems scientists have is that dog populations have become very mixed over time, as a result of being moved around by their human owners. This complicates the genetic signal.      The difficulty is further amplified by the fact that some dogs have at times also clearly back-bred with wild wolves. Teasing all this apart is very difficult.      A resolution will require more sampling and more analysis, particularly of the core, or nuclear, DNA of ancient animals.      This and many of the previous studies have relied on so-called mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), a small sub-packet of genetic material in cells that, although incredibly useful, does not represent the fullest information possible.      The larger nuclear DNA material could provide the more compelling answers but it is far harder to retrieve, especially in very old bones or fossils.

Based on the surrounding area or any uncovered materials, I will make an educated guess on the specific material. Step 6: Predict what happens next After considering the man's actions and the overall context, the next most likely step is that the man will start installing the chosen material (tiles, linoleum, or carpet) onto the adhesive-covered floor. He will likely ensure proper alignment and placement of the material, as well as use a specific tool or technique for the chosen material to ensure a secure bond. So, the man will begin installing the chosen material onto the adhesive-covered floor while ensuring proper alignment and adhesion."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

When the brakes fail while coming down a steep highway, he steers his way through a small town and is lucky to just dent the pickup of Jeff Cunningham.  Jeff demands Mike's employer pay for the damage, but the man refuses. Mike pays him himself. Later, the police find Mike in a bar and arrest him for reckless driving and having an expired license.  A total stranger, barmaid Paula Craig, pays his 50 fine. When Mike gets drunk, Paula quits her job and finds him a hotel room.

But I can use this background: A comet tail—and coma—are features visible in comets when they are illuminated by the Sun and may become visible from Earth when a comet passes through the inner Solar System. As a comet approaches the inner Solar System, solar radiation causes the volatile materials within the comet to vaporize and stream out of the nucleus, carrying dust away with them. Separate tails are formed of dust and gases, becoming visible through different phenomena; the dust reflects sunlight directly and the gases glow from ionisation.

What is an answer for this question: Which comet's dust would reflect sunlight, comet A or comet C? A:","output":"Comet A's dust would reflect sunlight.

In general he worked fluently, seldom revising, although Le roi de Lahore, his nearest approach to a traditional grand opera, took him several years to complete to his own satisfaction. It was finished in 1877 and was one of the first new works to be staged at the Palais Garnier, opened two years previously. The opera, with a story taken from the Mahabharata, was an immense success and was quickly taken up by the opera houses of eight Italian cities. It was also performed at the Hungarian State Opera House, the Bavarian State Opera, the Semperoper, Dresden, the Teatro Real in Madrid, and the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, in London. After the first Covent Garden performance, The Times summed the piece up in a way that was frequently to be applied to the composer's operas: \\"M. Massenet's opera, although not a work of genius proper, is one of more than common merit, and contains all the elements of at least temporary success.\\"This period was an early high point in Massenet's career.

In the same year he was elected to the Institut de France, a prestigious honour, rare for a man in his thirties. Camille Saint-Saëns, whom Massenet beat in the election for the vacancy, was resentful at being passed over for a younger composer.

U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis on Saturday slammed China's militarization of disputed South China Sea islands, insisting that weapons systems recently deployed in the area were meant to intimidate and coerce Beijing's neighbors. The comments came during a speech at the Shangri-La Dialogue, an annual Asian defense forum in Singapore. In the speech, Mattis laid out the broader U.S. strategy for a \\"free and open\\" Indo-Pacific region. \\"China's policy in the South China Sea stands in stark contrast to the openness our strategy promotes. It calls into question China's broader goals,\\" Mattis said. Specifically, the Pentagon chief mentioned China's deployment of anti-ship and surface-to-air missiles, electronic jammers, and the landing of a bomber aircraft at the Paracel Islands off the coast of Vietnam. \\"Despite China's claim to the contrary, the placement of these weapon systems is tied directly to military use for the purposes of intimidation and coercion,\\" Mattis added. Though much of the world is focused on an upcoming summit between North Korea and the United States, this year's Shangri-La Dialogue has focused primarily on the region's long-term future and how to deal with a more assertive China. Beijing has begun projecting power beyond its borders, most notably through the construction and militarization of islands in disputed areas of the South China Sea. China claims nearly the entire South China Sea, despite overlapping claims by countries including Vietnam, the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia and Taiwan. Last week, the United States disinvited China from the Rim of the Pacific exercise (RIMPAC), a major international maritime exercise to be held later this year, citing Beijing's behavior in the South China Sea. Mattis on Saturday referred to that disinvitation as an \\"initial response\\" to China, but he did not outline any additional steps that might be taken. \\"The U.S. will continue to pursue a constructive, results-oriented relationship with China, cooperating when possible and competing vigorously where...

China could also face further consequences such as exclusion from more international activities, similar to the disinvitation from the RIMPAC exercise. However, it is also possible that China might attempt to negotiate or engage in more discussions about its actions, particularly in response to increased pressure from the U.S. and other countries.

(CNN) -- Beyond skateboards, Silicon Valley and hippies, California has a trendsetting streak of a different kind. The state has been first to pass major public health initiatives that have spread throughout the country. California was first to require smog checks for clean air, pass anti-tobacco initiatives and bike helmets laws. While these laws were met with skepticism and ridicule, they've often become standard practice in other states. The Golden State was first to ban smoking in workplaces, bars and restaurants in 1998. Now similar rules exist throughout the country. Some advocates tout the state as a forward-thinking vanguard in which its health and safety laws are routinely emulated by other states. \\"There have been progressive legislations in tobacco, environment and obesity prevention,\\" said Mark Horton, a lecturer at the University of California Berkeley School of Public Health. \\"In some respect, the rest of the country looks to California as a laboratory for moving forward with those various types of initiatives.\\" But some critics liken the Golden State to a nanny state. California has 151,002 health and safety laws. \\"It never ends,\\" said Laer Pearce, who works in public affairs in Orange County. \\"Every year, several hundred bills come through and dozens of them tell us how to live our lives.\\" Starting in January, 760 new California laws went into effect -- for example, the importing of shark fins is prohibited, student athletes are required to have medical clearance after suffering a head injury, teens are banned from using tanning booths and the sale of caffeinated beer is forbidden. There's a perception that California has \\"more folks who are health-oriented and more health-minded,\\" said Horton, former director of the California Department of Public Health. It's not just workout fanatics hanging out at Muscle Beach, Sierra Club members hiking mountains or the uber-health-conscious touting organic foods. Californians in general tend to have healthier habits, ranking 10th for physical activity, fourth for healthy blood pressure and fifth for a diet high in fruits and vegetables compared with other states, according to America's Health Rankings.

Sure its a one of the most stylish films, but when it comes to content, even the masses will reject this one. Why? The films script is as amateur as a 2 year old baby. Script is king, without a good script even the greatest director of all-time cannot do anything. Tashan is produced by the most successful production banner 'Yash Raj Films' and Mega Stars appearing in it. But nothing on earth can save you if you script is bland. Thumbs down!  Performances: Anil Kapoor, is a veteran actor. But how could he okay a role like this? Akshay Kumar is great actor, in fact he's the sole saving grace. Kareena Kapoor has never looked so hot. She looks stunning and leaves you, all stand up. Saif Ali Khan doesn't get his due in here. Sanjay Mishra, Manoj Phawa and Yashpal Sharma are wasted. 'Tashan' is a boring film.

Hannibal escapes and sets out to rescue Templeton \\"Faceman\\" Peck (Bradley Cooper), who is held captive at Tuco's ranch. Hannibal saves Face after enlisting fellow Ranger B.A. Baracus (Quinton Jackson), driving to the rescue in BA's modified GMC Vandura van.[9] Pursued by Tuco, they stop at a nearby Army Hospital to recruit the services of eccentric pilot Howling Mad Murdock (Sharlto Copley). They flee in a medical helicopter, chased by Tuco, in a dogfight that leaves BA with a fear of flying. The battle ends when they lure Tuco's helicopter into American airspace, where it is shot down by a USAF F-22 Raptor for trespassing. Eight years later in Iraq, Hannibal is contacted by CIA Special Activities Division operative Lynch (Patrick Wilson), who assigns them a black ops mission to recover U.S. Treasury plates and over 1 billion in cash from Iraqi insurgents slated to move it out of Baghdad in an armored convoy. Hannibal's commanding officer, General Morrison (Gerald McRaney), consents to the operation but Face's former girlfriend, Defense Criminal Investigative Service Capt. Charissa Sosa (Jessica Biel), tries to discourage the team against getting the plates. The mission is successful; when the team returns to base, however, the money and Morrison's vehicle are destroyed by Brock Pike (Brian Bloom) and his men from the private security firm Black Forest. Without Morrison (the only proof that they were authorized to act), Hannibal, Face, Murdock, and BA are court martialed and they are sentenced to ten years in separate prisons and dishonorably discharged. Sosa also ended up court-martialed and is demoted to lieutenant.

Let's break the translation down into its parts: 1. \\"Älkäämme tehkö\\" means \\"Let us not make\\". It is the negative form of the verb, combined with the plural pronoun, \\"us\\". 2. \\"strategista virhettä\\" translates to \\"strategic mistake\\", thus keeping the same meaning from the original statement. 3. \\"haluamalla jo\\" means \\"already wanting\\", which expresses a degree of abruptness. 4. \\"ikään kuin\\" functions as \\"as it were\\" in Finnish, which is a phrase that has the same figurative meaning as in English. 5. \\"neuvotella pois\\" is the expression for \\"negotiate away\\" and works well, maintaining its intended meaning. 6. \\"joitakin neuvottelukohtia\\" corresponds to \\"some of the negotiating points\\"; the Finnish term for \\"negotiating points\\" is \\"neuvottelukohtia\\", and \\"joitakin\\" means \\"some of\\". 7. \\"joita tarvitsemme\\" comes from \\"joita\\" meaning \\"which\\" and \\"tarvitsemme\\" meaning \\"we need\\". 8. \\"tulevaa WTO-kierrosta varten\\" is the Finnish equivalent of \\"for the forthcoming WTO round\\", where \\"tulevaa\\" implies the upcoming nature of the round, \\"WTO-kierrosta\\" refers to the round of talks within the World Trade Organization (WTO), and \\"varten\\" serves as \\"for\\" in this context. Overall, the Finnish translation accurately conveys the intended meaning and retains the essence of the original English sentence."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write some highlights for the following article: Working as a guidance counselor five years ago in Palm Beach County, Estella Pyfrom noticed that fewer students had access to a computer after school. The sluggish economy forced many families to prioritize their money and use it for more pressing needs. \\"They needed food. They needed to pay their mortgage or their rent,\\" said Pyfrom, a former teacher. \\"Some of them lost their cars. So I knew it was a serious problem.\\" Without a computer at home, or reliable transportation to get to a computer, Pyfrom feared that many of these students would get left behind. So she bought a bus, filled it with computers and brought technology to the kids. Her mobile computer lab, Estella's Brilliant Bus, has provided free, computer-based tutoring for thousands of students since 2011. \\"If people don't have some knowledge of technology, they're going to be limited,\\" said Pyfrom, who retired in 2009 and used money from her savings to buy the bus. \\"It's absolutely essential that they get involved technologically.\\" Pyfrom is determined to help poor children get the same educational opportunities as other children. According to the Institute of the Study of Labor, students who lack access to a home computer are less likely to graduate high school. \\"The digital divide is absolutely real,\\" said Pyfrom, 76. \\"And it didn't just become a reality. It's been there for years, and it's getting bigger and more important.\\" Pyfrom's custom-designed bus is outfitted with 17 computer stations that are connected to high-speed Internet via satellite. Emblazoned on its side are the words \\"Have Knowledge, Will Travel\\" and \\"We bring learning to you.\\" The bus travels to schools, shelters and community centers throughout the county. \\"We serve children starting with age 3 all the way through senior citizens, based on what the needs are,\\" Pyfrom said. \\"We are bringing the learning and the technology to the neighborhoods. They all can benefit from that.\\" Pyfrom and her army of volunteers hold regular classes and tutoring sessions about four days a week. They offer lessons in computer and Internet basics as well as reading, math or science classes that supplement what children are learning in school. Sometimes, the bus simply serves as an open computer lab. The rules on the bus are few and simple. Among them, gum and Facebook are not allowed. Pyfrom takes a no-nonsense approach to her mobile classroom. \\"Excuses don't get the job done,\\" she said. \\"You do whatever it takes to make things happen. That's the only thing that works.\\" The computers are loaded with educational software, providing interactive exercises that reinforce state-mandated curricula. Children receive their own account login and password, allowing them to continue their work from anywhere they can access the Internet. Users can only advance to the next level in a subject once they reach 90% proficiency in the current one, and the software allows Pyfrom to track their progress. For older students, the bus brings GED and college preparatory assistance, anti-bullying and peer mediation classes, and student leadership training. Pyfrom and her team provide about 8,000 hours of instruction to at least 500 children a year. She hopes the extra time will help bring students up to their grade level in reading, vocabulary, math, science and life skills. Freddy and Brianna Rodriguez are two students benefiting from Pyfrom's bus. Adopted from foster care, the siblings struggled with their grades when they entered junior high school. \\"If I didn't have the bus to come to, it'd be hard to get to a computer,\\" said Brianna, 13. \\"My grades have gotten better. The one-on-one time, it helped me.\\" In working with the students, Pyfrom found that many parents didn't know how to use a computer. Now her bus helps them, too. \\"They're learning right along with the kids,\\" Pyfrom said. \\"They don't feel threatened, because what I say to them is, 'If your 4-year-old can use a computer and click a mouse, so can you.' \\" On the bus, adults can receive online banking tutorials, resume assistance and help searching for jobs and affordable housing. Pyfrom's efforts to help low-income families haven't stopped with her bus. She also partnered with a community nonprofit to help provide meals to 3,000 residents each month. Through that work, she's identified other ways her bus can help struggling neighbors build up technological proficiency necessary in the marketplace. \\"We want to do what we can do in (each) neighborhood to make things better for all,\\" Pyfrom said. \\"We run into people who really want to better their lifestyles and are without help. We can help them make a big difference in their neighborhoods.\\" To keep up the momentum of her efforts, Pyfrom has continued to pour her savings into maintaining and modifying her bus, so far spending about 1 million, she says. An easy retirement is not something she aspires to. \\"I'm not tired yet. And I don't think I'm going to get tired,\\" she said. \\"I'm constantly charged up. I look at the faces of the children and I get energized.\\" Pyfrom is determined to see her services expand throughout the state, even the country. She estimates she has enough savings to keep her bus running for another two years, but she hopes to find financial support before she runs out of money. \\"I don't think about what I'm not able to do or not going to be able to do,\\" she said. \\"I plan for the things that I think I'm going to do, need to do and want to do. And I think most of them are going to happen. \\"We've got to keep rolling. We're going to keep taking the service to the neighborhoods, and we are going to keep making a difference.\\" Want to get involved?

Frank is a peculiar old man with a taste for adventure and a mysterious past. He announces plans to visit the family, much to their surprise, but they decide to welcome him with open arms. Upon arrival, Frank shares thrilling stories from his past travels, and the family grows fond of him. ACT 2: A Shocking Twist A few days into his visit, Frank is found dead in his room. Autopsy reveals that he died from natural causes due to his frail health and old age. The news spreads, and a formal funeral is planned for two days later. As they prepare for the funeral, they receive an unexpected call from an unknown individual who claims to be an old friend of Frank searching for a missing artifact that the late uncle had possession of. Sensing the potential dangers involving the mysterious artifact, the family decides they must find the object before the unknown caller does. With only two days until Frank's funeral, the family decides to hide his dead body within their house, dealing with the unpleasant results of decomposition. Between all four members of the family, they take turns keeping watch over the body, ensuring its safety from prying eyes and the intruder hunting the artifact.  ACT 3: Unraveling the Mystery As the family digs deeper into Uncle Frank's past, they discover that he was once a highly sought after thief during his youth, known for his remarkable ability to steal rare and valuable items for an underground criminal network.

Meanwhile, sketchy figures begin lurking throughout their town, believed to be associates of the mysterious caller. As the family frantically searches through Frank's personal belongings, they uncover a trail that eventually leads them to the artifact. However, they also recognize that the power contained within the artifact is too dangerous to be left in any one person's hands. ACT 4: A Final Showdown During the funeral service, with Frank's body finally laid to rest, the unknown caller makes a sudden appearance, demanding the family hand over the artifact. In a climactic showdown, the Bensons stand up against the antagonist and his cronies, surprising themselves with acts of courage and quick thinking.

I cannot, in good faith, recommend this movie to anyone, and here are my reasons why. ​ First and foremost, let's discuss the film's plot (Step 1: Address the plot). Rather than captivating me with a fascinating story, \\"Lethargic Labyrinth\\" managed to deliver the dullest narrative I have had the misfortune of experiencing. The protagonist aimlessly roams through the labyrinth with no clear objective beyond simple survival, which not only became monotonous but also lacked any emotional depth or development (Step 2: Explain the lack of depth and development). The climax, if it could even be called that, fell flat and failed to satisfy the audience's expectations. ​ The acting, unfortunately, was not any better (Step 3: Address the acting). The lead actor's performance came across as uninspired, and the supporting cast did little more than follow suit. The actors seemed like they were simply going through the motions, and not once did I feel any connection to the characters they were portraying. This lack of chemistry significantly hindered my ability to become invested in their struggles or triumphs. ​ Step 4: Discuss the film's visuals and effects. One would think that a movie set in a labyrinthine environment could at least offer some visually striking scenes; in this case, however, the special effects felt outdated and failed to add any excitement to the proceedings. With an uneventful backdrop, low-quality CGI, and an overall lack of innovation, the film's technical aspects proved to be another disappointing factor. ​ Lastly, a functional script might have saved \\"Lethargic Labyrinth,\\" but the film suffered from subpar dialogue throughout (Step 5: Address the dialogue). Characters consistently engaged in irrelevant conversations, adding nothing to the plot or their development. The script seemed more fitting for a substandard soap opera than a high-budget, eagerly anticipated film. ​ In conclusion, though I wished to enjoy the cinematic journey promised by \\"Lethargic Labyrinth,\\" it left me with a sense of disappointment I cannot ignore. With its lackluster plot, uninspired acting, outdated visuals, and cringe-worthy dialogue, this film is hardly one to spend any time or money on. It saddens me to say this, but my only recommendation would be to give this movie a hard pass (Step 6: Summarize and give the overall recommendation)."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:This article: York-born William Etty (1787–1849) had originally been an apprentice printer in Hull, but on completing his apprenticeship at the age of 18 moved to London to become an artist. Strongly influenced by the works of Titian and Rubens, he became famous for painting nude figures in biblical, literary and mythological settings. While many of his peers greatly admired him and elected him a full Royal Academician in 1828, others condemned the content of his work as indecent.Throughout his early career Etty was highly regarded by wealthy lawyer Thomas Myers, who had been educated at Eton College and thus had a good knowledge of classical mythology. From 1832 onwards Myers regularly wrote to Etty to suggest potential subjects for paintings. Myers was convinced that there was a significant market for very large paintings, and encouraged Etty to make such works. In 1834, he suggested the theme of Ulysses (\\"Odysseus\\" in the original Greek) encountering the Sirens, a scene from the Odyssey in which a ship's crew sails past the island home of the Sirens. The Sirens were famous for the beauty of their singing, which would lure sailors to their deaths. Ulysses wanted to hear their song, so had his crew lash him to the ship's mast under strict orders not to untie him, after which they blocked their ears until they were safely out of range of the island.The topic of Ulysses encountering the Sirens was well suited to Etty's taste; as he wrote at the time, \\"My aim in all my great pictures has been to paint some great moral on the heart ... the importance of resisting SENSUAL DELIGHTS\\". In his depiction of the scene, he probably worked from Alexander Pope's translation, \\"Their song is death, and makes destruction please. / Unblest the man whom music wins to stay / Nigh the curs'd shore, and listen to the lay ... In verdant meads they sport, and wide around / Lie human bones that whiten all the ground. / The ground polluted floats with human gore / And human carnage taints the dreadful shore.\\" contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who was strongly influenced by the works of Titian and Rubens?, what is it ?

As a teenager, and a top member of his high school's wrestling team, he proves himself physically fit and athletic, as well as an academically exceptional student. When local Marine recruiting NCOs visit his school and give Ron and his fellow seniors an impassioned lecture about the Corps, Ron decides to enlist. He misses his prom, because he is unable to get a date with his love interest, Donna. He confronts her at the prom and has a dance with her on his last night before leaving.The story then jumps to Kovic's second Vietnam tour in 1968. Now a Marine sergeant and on patrol, his unit massacres a village of Vietnamese citizens, believing them to be enemy combatants. During the retreat, Kovic becomes disoriented and accidentally shoots one of the new arrivals to his platoon, a younger Marine private first class, Wilson, who ends up in the line of fire between sides. Despite the frantic efforts of the Navy Corpsman present who try to save him, Wilson dies from his wounds. Overwhelmed by guilt, Kovic appeals to his executive officer (XO), who merely tells him to forget the incident. The meeting has a negative effect on Ron, who is crushed at being brushed off by his XO.The platoon goes out on another hazardous patrol on January 20.

Possible answers:  *None of the above choices .;  *The boss ca n't get his cell phone fixed .;  *The boss ca n't stop the narrator from fighting .;  *The boss ca n't find anyone .;","output":"The source of management's anger in this situation stems from the fact that the boss cannot find anyone at the office and nobody is answering the phone. This lack of responsiveness and seemingly absent staff is likely causing the boss to wonder what is happening at the workplace, potentially suspecting that the employees are not fulfilling their duties or are engaged in unprofessional behavior. This can lead to a significant disruption in the smooth functioning of the office, as well as result in a loss of productivity and efficiency. The boss's anger is aggravated by the fact that he had to resort to calling a coworker on her cellphone, which might not be the standard means of communication within the office context. This indicates to the boss that the situation at the office is far from what is expected, contributing to his frustration. The options provided may not encapsulate the exact reason for the boss's anger, but the closest one would be \\"The boss can't find anyone.\\" While this is not entirely accurate, as the boss did manage to reach a coworker eventually, it does touch upon the core issue of the boss's frustration, which is their inability to locate the employees or get a response when calling the office. A more accurate option would be: \\"The boss is angry because no one is answering the office phone and the employees are seemingly unaccounted for.\\" This option highlights the main concerns the boss has, which include the lack of communication, the possible absence of employees, and the potential negative implications this could have on the office's productivity and efficiency."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Despite objections from Manchester United, Neville's plans were approved in 2012. In 2013, Giggs and Neville launched a hospitality company named GG Hospitality, with plans to build football-themed hotels and cafes around the United Kingdom, initially in Manchester and London. The first operation was a football-themed restaurant named Cafe Football in Stratford, London, which opened in November 2013, with Hotel Football, previously under the guise of the supporters club Neville announced in 2011, scheduled to be opened in late 2014.

Context: As of the census of 2000, there were 16,428 people, 5,229 households, and 4,094 families residing in the county. The population density was 8 people per square mile (3/km²). There were 5,773 housing units at an average density of 3 per square mile (1/km²). The racial makeup of the county was 64.96% Race (United States Census), 0.28% Race (United States Census) or Race (United States Census), 0.68% Race (United States Census), 0.60% Race (United States Census), 0.04% Race (United States Census), 30.69% from Race (United States Census), and 2.75% from two or more races. 16.3% were of German people, 6.2% identified as United States or American and 5.6% English people ancestry. 57.0% spoke English language, 41.7% Spanish language and 1.2% German language as their first language.

To figure out the percentage of people who were not from two or more races, you subtract this figure from 100%.

To his surprise, the photo, taken backstage after one of his performances, quickly went viral, People reports, nabbing more than 42,000 likes so far and gaining its owner some unexpected new fans. \\"I don't know who you are, but I like you!\\" one woman wrote. Another added, \\"You just tapped into a whole new demographic, my friend.\\" When one mother called him \\"awesome and an amazing husband,\\" Moss replied, \\"You are the real hero for actually pumping. I'm getting too much credit for cleaning a couple bottles and suction thingies.\\" Moss, who SheKnows.com describes as a Christian hip-hop artist from Grand Rapids, Michigan, later followed that post with a photo of his wife, Michelle, breastfeeding their son Judah, which has received almost as many likes. \\"I could go on and on about how happy I am to be a little piece of a movement that I didn't even know existed,\\" he says, though he adds he's \\"also a little saddened to realize how few men (or better put, 'males') don’t do the simplest task like washing a bottle.\\" While \\"I appreciate the love, likes, and kind words,\\" he says, breastfeeding mothers \\"are making HUGE sacrifices to give our next generation the best possible start in life\\" and \\"if anyone should get the credit it should be people like my wife!\\" In a comment on that photo, he later added that he doesn't discount \\"the millions of women who either can’t or choose not to breastfeed,\\" and that the important thing is to feed babies with love. (A photo of a mom's \\"perfect\\" post-baby body is also getting hype.) Expand this summary.","output":"A day in the life of a rapper may not be what you imagine, especially in the case of George Moss, a Christian hip-hop artist from Grand Rapids, Michigan. Moss recently uploaded a photo of himself backstage after a performance cleaning breast pump equipment for his wife, which promptly went viral on Facebook. The photo, capturing a glimpse into the rapper's personal life, has garnered over 42,000 likes and attracted many new fans who praised him for being supportive and involved in parenting. Moss shared another photo soon afterward, featuring his wife Michelle breastfeeding their son Judah. Expressing gratitude for the positive response, he was also surprised by how many men were not involved in simple tasks such as cleaning baby bottles. Moss emphasized his appreciation for breastfeeding mothers who make significant sacrifices to provide the best possible start for their children. He also acknowledged the importance of feeding babies with love, regardless of whether mothers are able or choose to breastfeed. Moss's unexpected fame from sharing these intimate moments reveals a growing awareness and support for involved parenting, particularly when it comes to enabling breastfeeding. His photos highlight the crucial role that fathers can play in creating an environment that supports and encourages healthy choices for infant care. It is essential to recognize that providing support to breastfeeding mothers is not solely about helping with the physical aspects, such as cleaning bottles or pumps. Emotional support can also make a world of difference. For some mothers, breastfeeding can be a challenging and emotional experience filled with self-doubt and feelings of inadequacy. A partner's encouragement and reassurance can provide the confidence and motivation needed to persevere. While Moss rightfully acknowledges that breastfeeding may not be the right choice for all families, his actions and public display of support have undoubtedly resonated with many new parents. As more men embrace their roles as actively involved, supportive partners in infant care, Moss's actions serve as an inspiration for other fathers to become integral components in their children's lives from the very beginning. The positive reaction to these viral moments also showcases society's increasing awareness of the significance of breastfeeding, as well as the critical role both parents play in supporting and raising their children. As more fathers step up and participate in all aspects of parenting tasks, from bedtime routines to emotional support, the benefits for both the family unit and society as a whole will only increase. In conclusion, George Moss's viral photos have opened up a broader conversation on involved parenting, the importance of breastfeeding when possible, and the role fathers can play in supporting their partners. With this new understanding and communication about the responsibilities of both parents, we can hope to create an even more supportive and nurturing environment for future generations."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Summarize this article: The government will make the report public after holding talks with major political parties on 6 January, a senior federal minister said. Andhra Pradesh, from which Telangana would be carved, saw protests for and against the new state this year. The final decision to create a new state lies with the Indian parliament. But the state assembly must pass a resolution approving the creation of Telangana. In February, the government decided to set up a committee headed by an ex-chief justice of the Supreme Court of India, BN Srikrishna, to examine the demands for the new state. Mr Srikrishna handed over his report to federal Home Minister P Chidambaram on Thursday. Mr Chidambaram said he would hold consultations with eight recognised political parties of Andhra Pradesh on 6 January after which the \\"report will be made public\\". \\"That is the only way in a democracy and those who respect democracy must also respect the process of democracy,\\" Mr Chidambaram said. Fearing fresh violence in the state after the publication of the report, the government has appealed to the people of Andhra Pradesh to stay calm. Correspondents say there are deep divisions within political parties over the Telangana issue. In December last year, India's Congress party-led government promised that the new state would be formed but later said more talks were needed. Parties are split on the issue. Congress is also in power in Andhra Pradesh. The announcement prompted widespread protests in the state, and a student committed suicide in support of the formation of Telangana.

Moreover, Father Thomas is a left-wing radical and an outspoken proponent of Liberation Theology, leading him to constant clashes and bickering with the Bishopâwho nevertheless appreciates his abilities. While the young protagonist's personal traditional conservatism and religious beliefs are offended by the older priest's blatant disregard for his vow of celibacy, he struggles with his own homosexual urges, especially after he meets Graham at a local gay hangout and the two embark on a physical relationship. Meanwhile, student Lisa Unsworth has confided she was sexually abused by her father, who confirms her story. Both have revealed their secret in the confessional, however, so Father Greg is required to honour the sanctity of the Sacrament of Penance and not reveal what he has been told. He tries to warn her mother to keep a close watch on her, but the naive woman believes her daughter is safe while in the care of her husband. When Mrs. Unsworth discovers her husband molesting Lisa and realises the priest knew what was happening, she lashes out at him. Adding to his torment is his arrest for having sex with Graham in a parked car. When he pleads guilty to the charge, the story is headlined on the front page of the local newspaper and, unable to face his parishioners, Father Greg relocates to a remote rural parish headed by a disapproving and unforgiving priest. Father Matthew convinces him to return to St. Mary's, and the two preside over a Mass that is disrupted by the loud protests of those opposed to Father Greg's presence on the altar. Father Matthew demands they leave the chapel. The two priests then begin to distribute the Eucharist, but the remaining parishioners ignore Father Greg and line up to receive communion from Father Matthew.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the ship Shackleton calculated had travelled a mere 95 miles since 19 January? , can you please find it?   On 21 February 1915, Endurance, still held fast, drifted to her most southerly latitude, 76° 58′S. Thereafter she began moving with the pack in a northerly direction. On 24 February, Shackleton realised that they would be held in the ice throughout the winter, and ordered ship's routine abandoned. The dogs were taken off board and housed in ice-kennels or \\"dogloos\\", and the ship's interior was converted to suitable winter quarters for the various groups of men—officers, scientists, engineers, and seamen. A wireless apparatus was rigged, but their location was too remote to receive or transmit signals.Shackleton was aware of the recent example of Wilhelm Filchner's ship, the Deutschland, which had become icebound in the same vicinity three years earlier. After Filchner's attempts to establish a land base at Vahsel Bay failed, his ship Deutschland was trapped on 6 March 1912, about 200 miles (320 km) off the coast of Coats Land. Six months later, at latitude 63° 37', the ship broke free, then sailed to South Georgia apparently none the worse for its ordeal. Shackleton thought that a similar experience might allow Endurance to make a second attempt to reach Vahsel Bay in the following Antarctic spring.In February and March, the rate of drift was very slow. At the end of March Shackleton calculated that the ship had travelled a mere 95 miles (153 km) since 19 January. However, as winter set in the speed of the drift increased, and the condition of the surrounding ice changed. On 14 April, Shackleton recorded the nearby pack \\"piling and rafting against the masses of ice\\"—if the ship was caught in this disturbance \\"she would be crushed like an eggshell\\". In May, as the sun set for the winter months, the ship was at 75° 23′S, 42° 14′W, still drifting northwards. It would be at least four months before spring brought the chance of an opening of the ice, and there was no certainty that Endurance would break free in time to attempt a return to the Vahsel Bay area. Shackleton now considered the possibility of finding an...","output":"The name of the ship that Shackleton calculated had traveled a mere 95 miles since 19 January is the Endurance. The Endurance was an exploration vessel led by Sir Ernest Shackleton during the Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition (1914-1917).

Can you tell me what it is? A:","output":"The Zipingpu Hydropower Plant is a hydroelectric power generating facility located in China, specifically 20 kilometers east of the epicenter in question. This plant has faced damage due to an earthquake, but a recent inspection revealed that the damage was less severe than initially thought. Despite the damages, the plant remains structurally stable and safe. The nearby Tulong reservoir upstream, however, is in danger of collapse. As a response to this situation, approximately 2,000 troops have been allocated to the Zipingpu Hydropower Plant to help release the pressure exerted on the reservoir through a spillway. This spillway aids in controlling the water flow and lowering the water levels, reducing the risk of collapse. In addition to the Zipingpu Hydropower Plant, a total of 391 dams in the region, predominantly smaller ones, have experienced damage as a result of the earthquake. The hydroplant is a critical piece of infrastructure for China, contributing to the nation's electricity production and highlighting the potential vulnerability of such facilities in the event of natural disasters."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: Saudi Arabia has financed a large purchase of infantry weapons from Croatia and quietly funneled them to antigovernment fighters in Syria in a drive to break the bloody stalemate that has allowed President Bashar al-Assad to cling to power, according to American and Western officials familiar with the purchases.      The weapons began reaching rebels in December via shipments shuttled through Jordan, officials said, and have been a factor in the rebels’ small tactical gains this winter against the army and militias loyal to Mr. Assad.      The arms transfers appeared to signal a shift among several governments to a more activist approach to assisting Syria’s armed opposition, in part as an effort to counter shipments of weapons from Iran to Mr. Assad’s forces. The weapons’ distribution has been principally to armed groups viewed as nationalist and secular, and appears to have been intended to bypass the jihadist groups whose roles in the war have alarmed Western and regional powers.      For months regional and Western capitals have held back on arming the rebels, in part out of fear that the weapons would fall into the hands of terrorists. But officials said the decision to send in more weapons is aimed at another fear in the West about the role of jihadist groups in the opposition. Such groups have been seen as better equipped than many nationalist fighters and potentially more influential.      The action also signals the recognition among the rebels’ Arab and Western backers that the opposition’s success in pushing Mr. Assad’s military from much of Syria’s northern countryside by the middle of last year gave way to a slow, grinding campaign in which the opposition remains outgunned and the human costs continue to climb.      Washington’s role in the shipments, if any, is not clear. Officials in Europe and the United States, including those at the Central Intelligence Agency, cited the sensitivity of the shipments and declined to comment publicly.      But one senior American official described the shipments as “a maturing of the opposition’s logistical pipeline.” The official noted that the opposition remains fragmented and operationally incoherent, and added that the recent Saudi purchase was “not in and of itself a tipping point.”      “I remain convinced we are not near that tipping point,” the official said.      The official added that Iran, with its shipments to Syria’s government, still outstrips what Arab states have sent to the rebels.      The Iranian arms transfers have fueled worries among Sunni Arab states about losing a step to Tehran in what has become a regional contest for primacy in Syria between Sunni Arabs and the Iran-backed Assad government and Hezbollah of Lebanon.      Another American official said Iran has been making flights with weapons into Syria that are so routine that he referred to them as “a milk run.” Several of the flights were by an Iranian Air Force Boeing jet using the name Maharaj Airlines, he said.      While Persian Gulf Arab nations have been sending military equipment and other assistance to the rebels for more than a year, the difference in the recent shipments has been partly of scale. Officials said multiple planeloads of weapons have left Croatia since December, when many Yugoslav weapons, previously unseen in the Syrian civil war, began to appear in videos posted by rebels on YouTube.      Many of the weapons — which include a particular type of Yugoslav-made recoilless gun, as well as assault rifles, grenade launchers, machine guns, mortars and shoulder-fired rockets for use against tanks and other armored vehicles — have been extensively documented by one blogger, Eliot Higgins, who writes under the name Brown Moses and has mapped the new weapons’ spread through the conflict.      He first noticed the Yugoslav weapons in early January in clashes in the Dara’a region near Jordan, but by February he was seeing them in videos posted by rebels fighting in the Hama, Idlib and Aleppo regions.      Officials familiar with the transfers said the arms were part of an undeclared surplus in Croatia remaining from the 1990s Balkan wars. One Western official said the shipments included “thousands of rifles and hundreds of machine guns” and an unknown quantity of ammunition.      Croatia’s Foreign Ministry and arms-export agency denied that such shipments had occurred. Saudi officials have declined requests for interviews about the shipments for two weeks. Jordanian officials also declined to comment. ||||| The UK said it was ready to 'significantly increase' its support for Syria's opposition      The Syrian opposition has agreed to attend an international summit in Rome, after the US and UK \\"promised specific aid\\" to the Syrian people.      The group had previously announced it would boycott the talks because of \\"the world's silence\\" over the violence.      US Secretary of State John Kerry and British Foreign Minister William Hague earlier confirmed there would be more support for Syria's opposition.      Mr Kerry was in London as part of his first foreign trip since taking office.      The Syrian opposition's announcement came amid reports of a deadly explosion and heavy fighting in an eastern part of the Syrian capital, Damascus.      It also emerged on Monday that a member of the UN peacekeeping force monitoring the ceasefire between Israeli and Syrian troops in the demilitarised Golan Heights was missing.      \\"We can confirm that a staff member is not accounted for and we are in touch with the relevant parties to determine what has happened,\\" UN spokesman Eduardo del Buey told the Associated Press.      'Alleviate the suffering'      After meeting Mr Hague and British Prime Minister David Cameron, Mr Kerry called Syrian Opposition Council President Moaz Al-Khatib and encouraged him to join the Rome talks on Thursday.      No further details have been released about the conversation.      But on Monday evening, Mr al-Khatib said in a Facebook post that his group would fly to Italy.      \\"After discussions with coalition leaders and various calls, the coalition leadership has decided to stop the suspension of the visit to the Friends of Syria conference in Rome,\\" the statement said.      More specifically Mr Kerry and Mr Hague had both offered guarantees \\"to alleviate the suffering of our people\\".      The talks would be \\"used as a practical way to reassess relations between the Syrian opposition and international parties\\", the post said.      Mr Kerry is due to meet Syrian opposition members and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Berlin on Tuesday.      The US Secretary of State, who succeeded Hillary Clinton, is on an 11-day tour of Europe and the Middle East.      Speaking in London, Mr Kerry said he understood Syrians wanted results from the summit and promised it would not just be a talking shop.      \\"We are determined that the Syrian opposition is not going to be dangling in the wind, wondering where the support is, if it is coming,'' he told reporters after meeting Mr Cameron and Mr Hague.      \\"We are not going to let the Syrian opposition not have its ability to have its voice properly heard in this process.\\"      Mr Hague also said the UK was preparing to \\"significantly increase\\" its support for Syria's opposition.      Earlier, the Syrian foreign minister Walid Muallem had announced his government was ready for talks with its opponents, even armed rebels.      Meanwhile, a massive blast was reported in the al-Qaboun neighbourhood in Damascus on Monday evening.      Several Syrian security were killed in the explosion caused by a car bomb, according the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based activist group.      Rebels were clashing with security forces and mortars had been fired in the area, it added.      The SOHR is one of the most prominent organisations documenting and reporting incidents and casualties in the Syrian conflict.      The group says its reports are impartial, though its information cannot be independently verified. ||||| At least 141 people, half of them children, were killed when the Syrian military fired at least four missiles into the northern province of Aleppo last week, Human Rights Watch said Tuesday.      A Syrian villager, Abu Ibrahim, 73, writes the name of his granddaughter on her grave who was killed from an airstrike by Syrian government forces, at Jabal al-Zaweya village of Sarja, in Idlib, Syria,... (Associated Press)      The international rights group said the strikes hit residential areas and called them an \\"escalation of unlawful attacks against Syria's civilian population.\\" The statement from the New York-based group followed a visit to the area by a HRW researcher.      Aleppo, Syria's largest city, has been the scene of some of the heaviest fighting of the civil war pitting President Bashar Assad's regime against rebels fighting to oust him.      Rebels quickly seized several neighborhoods in an offensive on the city in July, but the government still controls some districts and the battle has developed into a bloody stalemate, with heavy street fighting that has ruined neighborhoods and forced thousands to flee.      A Human Rights Watch researcher who visited Aleppo last week to inspect the targeted sites, said up to 20 buildings were destroyed in each area hit by a missile. There were no signs of any military targets in the residential districts, located in rebel-held parts of Aleppo and its northern countryside, said Ole Solvang, the HRW's researcher.      \\"Just when you think things can't get any worse, the Syrian government finds ways to escalate its killing tactics,\\" Solvang said.      Human rights watch said 71 children were among the 141 people killed in the four missile strikes on three opposition-controlled neighborhoods in eastern Aleppo. It listed the names of the targeted neighborhoods as Jabal Badro, Tariq al-Bab and Ard al-Hamra. The fourth strike documented by the group was in Tel Rifat, north of Aleppo.      \\"The extent of the damage from a single strike, the lack of (military) aircraft in the area at the time, and reports of ballistic missiles being launched from a military base near Damascus overwhelmingly suggest that government forces struck these areas with ballistic missiles,\\" the report said.      Syrian anti-regime activists first reported the attacks last week, saying they involved ground-to-ground missiles, and killed dozens of people. The reports could not be independently confirmed because Syrian authorities severely restrict access to media.      Human Rights Watch said it compiled a list of those killed in the missile strikes from cemetery burial records, interviews with relatives and neighbors, and information from the Aleppo Media Center and the Violations Documentation Center, a network of local activists.      The rebels control large swaths of land in northeastern Syria. In recent weeks, Assad's regime has lost control of several sites with key infrastructure in that part of the country, including a hydroelectric dam, a major oil field and two army bases along the road linking Aleppo with the airport to its east.      A key focus for the rebels in the Aleppo area is to capture the city's international airport, which the opposition fighters have been attacking for weeks.      Opposition forces have also been hitting the heart of Damascus with occasional mortars shells or bombings, posing a stiff challenge to the regime in its seat of power.      U.S. and NATO officials have previously said that Syria has a significant ballistic missile capability and is believed to have a few hundred missiles with a range of some 700 kilometers (440 miles) that could hit targets deep inside Turkey, a NATO member and one of the harshest critics of the Assad regime.      NATO has in recent weeks deployed Patriot missile systems along Turkey's border with Syria.      The missile attacks have outraged the leaders of the exiled opposition who have accused their Western backers of indifference to the suffering of the Syrian people. ||||| Summary:","output":"Saudi Arabia has bought a lot of weapons from Croatia and has sent them to fighters in Syria who are against the government. They have done this to try and stop President Bashar al-Assad from keeping his power. The weapons have been helping the rebels fight against the army and other groups that support President Assad. These weapons have been given to certain groups that are not as scary as some jihadist groups. This is because some people are worried that if they give weapons to the rebels, they might end up with terrorists. The weapons from Saudi Arabia have helped the rebels but they have not yet tipped the balance in their favor. Iran has been giving weapons to Syria's government and this has caused tension between Sunni Arab states and Iran. The United States and United Kingdom say they will provide more support to Syria's opposition, and the Syrian opposition has agreed to attend an international summit to discuss the conflict. Meanwhile, there is still a lot of fighting and destruction happening in Syria."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Burning fossil fuels has led to an increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. This carbon dioxide is then absorbed by the oceans, which lowers the pH of the water. Ocean acidification can kill corals and shellfish. It may also cause marine organisms to reproduce less, which could harm other organisms in the food chain. As a result, there also may be fewer marine organisms for humans to consume.  Many years ago there was a beach Called Coast Brigs where many coral and other life lived. A refinery that burned coal was built nearby and over time the water nearby became very acidic. The coral and marine life died because of this but a few miles north on another beach named Greendale the same creatures are surviving just fine.  Will building a refinery at Greendale cause the acidity of the water to increase or decrease? Answer:","output":"Building a refinery at Greendale is likely to cause an increase in the acidity of the water in the surrounding area, due to the emissions generated as a result of burning fossil fuels. This increase in acidity could potentially have devastating consequences for the local marine ecosystem, as was observed in the case of Coast Brigs.  The process of ocean acidification, as described, begins with the release of excess carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere. The burning of fossil fuels, such as coal, is a major contributor to this increase in atmospheric CO2. When the CO2 is absorbed by the oceans, it reacts with seawater to form carbonic acid, causing the pH levels of the water to decrease and making the water more acidic. This increase in acidity can be detrimental to many marine organisms, particularly those with calcium carbonate shells or exoskeletons, such as corals and shellfish. Acidic conditions cause the dissolution of calcium carbonate, weakening the structures and increasing the organisms' vulnerability to disease or predation. Furthermore, an increase in acidity can disrupt the reproduction and growth of various marine species and, consequently, impact the entire food chain. In the case of Coast Brigs, the construction of the coal-burning refinery significantly contributed to the local increase in ocean acidity and, ultimately, led to the death of coral and marine life in the area. The construction of a similar refinery at Greendale could have analogous consequences, even if it may take time for the effects to become noticeable. However, it's important to note that there are various factors which can influence the extent to which ocean acidification occurs and affects marine life in a particular region. Factors such as ocean currents, the buffering capacity of the local seawater, and other sources of pollution in the area may all play a role in determining how severe the consequences of ocean acidification will be. Nevertheless, building a refinery at Greendale would most likely lead to an increase in the acidity of the water in the area, posing a major threat to the well-being of the same marine species that survived in this location. Taking into account the negative effects of constructing a refinery on marine ecosystems, it is essential to consider the potential consequences and alternative, more environmentally friendly options before proceeding with such a project."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Background music may seem harmless, but it can have a powerful effect on those who hear it. Recorded background music first found its way into factories, shops and restaurants in the USA. Very soon it spread to other parts of the world. Now it is becoming difficult to go shopping or eat a meal without listening to background music. To begin with, background music was intended simply to create a soothing   atmosphere. Recently, however, it's becoming a big business. An American marketing expert has shown that music can boost  sales or increase factory production by as much as a third. But it has to be the light music. Lively music has no effect at all on sales. Slow music can increase receipts  by 34%. This is probably because shoppers slow down and have more opportunity to spot items they would like to buy. Yet, slow music isn't always the answer. The expert found that in restaurants slow music meant customers took longer to eat their meals, which reduced overall sales.

Input: this happened a while ago, but ramifications are still relevant, and I've been told different judgements by different people on if I'm an asshole or not... so a while ago my best friend and I decided we wanted to get together and have an epic road trip.  we live quite a ways away from each other; 2800km (1700 miles).  so the plan was for her to fly out to where I lived and then we'd road trip back to where she lived.  once there we were going to spend about a week together just having fun and reminiscing (we were college friends and hadn't seen each other in a couple years).  along the way stopping in different places and generally having a great time.   the first part of this plan went off without a hitch.  she flew to my place, we had an awesome time, and then the road trip began.  we had a blast-- blaring music, sleeping in the car under the stars, swimming under waterfalls, and exploring interesting off road attractions.  I noticed, however, that she was getting anxious because she wasn't getting money in from her work that she was supposed to (something about papers that were supposed to be forwarded in time).  I told her not to worry about it-- I had enough money, and that she could pay me back anything when we got back to her place and sorted it out. a major part of our trip that I had wanted to do was visit a big city near where we were going to be.  she knew this (we'd made a rough plan of everything we were going to do on this trip), and knew that we were going to take a bus into the city from a smaller town so as we weren't driving in an unfamiliar city with millions of people in it.  well the day we were going to the city her grumpiness and agitation had begun to get to head.  she didn't speak the entire bus ride there, so I let her be, thinking maybe when we got there she'd be in a better mood (after all, we had lots of fun stuff planned for the city!).  once in the city, however, she immediately declared how much she hated it, and how everyone there was always so stupid and angry and how the city smelled funny and went on and on.  I snapped and asked her why she didn't say something *before* we'd gotten there.  no response.  regardless, we went to our first destination.  she noticed how much this place cost to go to, and said she didn't have enough money.  I said that was fine, that I'd pay for it.  she said no-- told me to go by myself.  I was angry at this point, and said that was ridiculous and began to walk away.  she said she was just going to stand there and wait for me to go to which I retorted 'fine', and just continued walking.   I ended up walking only about thirty feet to a nice fountain where I was able to sit and relax and calm down a bit.  I looked over and saw her a few minutes later walk away; she obviously didn't see me.  I bit later she text me asking me where the hell I was.  I told her where I was, and she was *furious*, saying she'd already walked all the way back to the bus station. (I will add here that we are, despite the immaturity this may all seem-- fully grown adults).  I went back to the bus station, and she wouldn't say two words to me.  when we got back to where the car was she said she was calling her boyfriend to pick her up (we were about 400km from her house only), and that I should just leave and go home (a nice 2500km drive... by myself with no warning).  not that I objected as I was *very* angry at that moment-- I'd spent a lot of money on that trip, and I didn't understand why she was so furious at me.   and since that day she hasn't talked to me since-- nor has any of our mutual friends as, apparently, I am an asshole.   ...am I?

Question: Is Elizabeth dead? Movie title: Just like Heaven Movie plot: Elizabeth Masterson (Witherspoon), a young emergency medicine physician whose work is her whole life, is in a serious car accident while on her way to a blind date. Three months later, David Abbott (Ruffalo), a landscape architect recovering from the sudden death of his wife, moves into the apartment that had been Elizabeth's, after 'discovering' it in what seems to be a 'fateful' happenstance. Elizabeth's spirit begins to appear to David in the apartment with ghostly properties and abilities that make it clear that something is not right. She can suddenly appear and disappear, walk or move through walls and objects, and once takes over his actions. When they meet, they are both surprised, as Elizabeth is still unaware of her recent history and refuses to think she is dead. David tries to have her spirit exorcised from the apartment, but to no avail. Since only David can see and hear her, others think that he is hallucinating and talking to himself. David and Elizabeth's spirit begin to 'bond', as much as that is possible, and he takes her out-of-town to a beautiful landscaped garden he designed. Elizabeth tells him she senses she has 'been there' before, and, in fact, the garden was something she was dreaming of in the opening scenes of the film, where she was awakened by a colleague from cat-napping after working a 26-hour shift in the hospital. Together, assisted by a psychic bookstore clerk, Darryl (Heder), Elizabeth and David find out who she is, what happened to her, and why they are connected. She is not dead, but in a coma, her body being kept on life support at the hospital where she used to work. When David discovers that in accordance with her living will, she will soon be allowed to die, he tries to prevent this by telling Elizabeth's sister, Abby, that he can see her and what the situation involves. It is revealed that one of Elizabeth's young nieces can also sense her presence. Abby thinks David is mentally disturbed and drives him out of her house. Desperate, David decides to prevent...

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Is it true that can a pawn take a piece in front of it based on the following text? Unlike other pieces, the pawn does not capture in the same direction as it moves. A pawn captures diagonally forward one square to the left or right (see diagram).","output":"Based on the provided text, it is not true that a pawn can take a piece in front of it directly. The text clearly states that a pawn captures differently than how it moves, meaning its capturing move is distinct from its regular forward move. In chess, a pawn moves forward one square, but captures diagonally forward instead, either one square to the left or one square to the right. This is a unique characteristic of the pawn, as other chess pieces such as the rook, knight, bishop, queen, and king capture in the same direction they move. To further understand the pawn's movements and the circumstances in which it captures, let's delve into some game scenarios: 1. In a regular situation, if there is an opponent's piece directly in front of a pawn, the pawn cannot capture that piece nor can it advance forward. In this case, the pawn would be \\"blocked\\" as it has no available forward moves or captures. 2. If an opponent's piece is diagonally forward to the left or right of the pawn, the pawn can capture that piece by moving to the respective square. 3. It is essential to remember that a pawn can only advance forward when there are no pieces blocking its way. If there is an open space, a pawn has the option to move one square forward or, if it is still in its starting position (on the second rank for white pawns or the seventh rank for black pawns), it can move two squares forward as its first move. 4. Another unique aspect of pawn capturing is \\"en passant.\\" This rule applies when a pawn advances two squares from its starting position and lands beside an opponent's pawn. In this case, the opponent's pawn has the option to capture the first pawn \\"en passant\\" as if it had only moved one square forward. This capture must be done immediately in the next move, or the right to do so is forfeited. In conclusion, based on the text and an understanding of the rules and movements of a pawn in a chess game, a pawn cannot capture a piece directly in front of it. Instead, a pawn's capturing move is limited to its diagonal forward movements to the left or right. The uniqueness of a pawn's capturing move differentiates it from other chess pieces and emphasizes the importance of considering the specificities of each piece's movements and capturing abilities when strategizing during a game of chess."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Team Black studied air pollution and the ozone layer, Team Red studied the water.  But I can use this background: Unfortunately, the layer of good ozone is being destroyed by air pollution. The chief culprits are chlorine and bromine gases. They are released in aerosol sprays, coolants, and other products. Loss of ozone has created an ozone hole over Antarctica. Ozone depletion results in higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth. In humans, this increases skin cancers and eye cataracts. It also disturbs the nitrogen cycle, kills plankton, and disrupts ocean food webs. The total loss of the ozone layer would be devastating to most life. Its rate of loss has slowed with restrictions on pollutants, but it is still at risk.  What is an answer for this question: Which team didn't observe that aerosol sprays are being released into the atmosphere? A:","output":"Based on the given background information and the research focuses of each team, it can be concluded that Team Red did not observe aerosol sprays being released into the atmosphere. Team Black was primarily studying air pollution and the ozone layer. Their focus on air pollution would involve monitoring and analyzing various sources of pollution, including aerosol sprays that release harmful chlorine and bromine gases. Thus, Team Black would have been the team to observe aerosol sprays being released into the atmosphere. On the other hand, Team Red was studying the water in Antarctica. Their research focus would include the effects of pollution on water bodies, such as how increased UV radiation caused by ozone depletion impacts marine life and ecosystems.

Question: It's common for parents to feel emotional when the moment comes for their child to leave home and go to university. Even parents who don't speak about the event are likely to feel a sense of sadness because it's the end of an era where you and your family were at the centre of your child's world. As a parent you'll probably continue to support your child in different ways, but the main job of raising your child is over. It's a huge change for everyone involved.          There are a few things that you can do to make the transition easier. Plan carefully for your child's departure and think about how you can help. Many parents take their child to university for the first time. If you decide to do that, be ready to feel a real wrench when the time comes to say goodbye. Your child will probably be as nervous as you are about the moment when you finally say goodbye - but that might not show!        Be positive and cheerful about the choice your child has made to continue studying, and plan to leave once you've unpacked the car and looked around your child's new living accommodations. If you can, save your tears for the car - you'll make things easier on your child and yourself.        The more you've invested in being a parent, the more you'll feel a sense of loss, so the sadness you feel now is a sign that you've been a good mom or dad. Remind yourself that parenting is all about raising an independent and confident child who functions well without you. If your child quickly settles and starts enjoying himself, you should congratulate yourself.        It's also only fair to allow yourself some time to grieve . Don't expect to pick yourself up and move on straight away. But you may decide to find a hobby or sport to fill your extra time. Perhaps you've always wanted to learn a new language, go to yoga classes or take up swimming. You may decide to spend more time with family and close friends, who are likely to be feeling the absence of your child as well.        Agree on the best approach to staying in touch...

The alewife is a small, herring-like fish (Alosa pseudoharengus) that is commonly found in the North Atlantic Ocean, as well as coastal and inland waters in northeastern North America. The text specifies that the intended fishing area is located in the inland waters of Inverness County. Inverness County is a region found in the Canadian province of Nova Scotia that has a coastline along the Gulf of St. Lawrence and the Atlantic Ocean, as well as numerous rivers and lakes. These inland waters provide a suitable habitat for alewives. The French text also describes the use of a net trap called a \\"trappe en filet\\" in this fishing activity, with specific reference to its dimensions. This net trap is stated to have a length greater than 15 meters. The numbers \\"200 84\\" are also mentioned, but it is unclear whether they are related to the length or another feature of the net trap as context is missing.

Given the question: What is the final step of the following process: -  Air is pulled into the lungs - Oxygen moves from the lungs into the bloodstream - Air is pushed through the vocal chords - A person talks The answer is:","output":"The final step of the mentioned process is \\"A person talks.\\" To understand this process, we can break it down into the following four steps: 1. Air is pulled into the lungs: This occurs during inhalation when the diaphragm and intercostal muscles contract, expanding the chest cavity and lowering the air pressure inside the lungs. The lowered pressure causes outside air to rush in, filling the lungs with a fresh supply of oxygen. 2. Oxygen moves from the lungs into the bloodstream: Once inside the lungs, the oxygen-rich air travels through a network of small air sacs called alveoli. The walls of the alveoli are extremely thin and surrounded by a network of tiny blood vessels called capillaries. The oxygen in the air diffuses across the alveolar walls and into the bloodstream, where it binds to hemoglobin molecules in red blood cells. At the same time, carbon dioxide, a waste product, diffuses out of the blood and into the alveoli to be exhaled. 3. Air is pushed through the vocal chords: When we speak, the diaphragm and intercostal muscles relax, making the chest cavity smaller and increasing the air pressure inside the lungs. This forces air out of the lungs and up through the windpipe (trachea). As the air passes through the voice box (larynx), it causes the vocal cords to vibrate, producing sound. 4. A person talks: This is the final step of the process, where the sound produced by the vibrating vocal cords is shaped into speech by the tongue, lips, and other parts of the mouth. The human brain controls the fine movements of these muscles to form words and sentences, allowing us to communicate with others."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Translate this to English?","output":"In cases where there are significant uncertainties or residual risk, the EIA describes the emergency planning requirements. The Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) is a process that evaluates the potential effects a proposed project may have on the environment. It is an important tool in decision-making, as it identifies and addresses potential environmental impacts before a project proceeds. One aspect of the EIA process is considering and accounting for emergency situations where significant uncertainties or residual risks may exist. Emergency planning requirements are provisions and guidelines developed to establish a response strategy to potential emergencies during a project's implementation. These requirements focus on reducing risks, preventing accidents, and minimizing any adverse impacts on human health and the environment. In the context of an EIA, emergency planning requirements may include, but are not limited to: 1. Identification of potential emergency scenarios: This involves a thorough assessment of potential risks and uncertainties that may arise during the project's implementation. This can include natural disasters, technical failures, human error, or any other unforeseen occurrences. 2. Response strategies and procedures: Establishing clear and concise guidelines and procedures for responding to a specific emergency is crucial. These strategies may include evacuation plans, hazardous material containment, first aid provisions, communication channels with relevant authorities, and other necessary tools and resources to manage the situation effectively. 3. Roles and responsibilities: Designating roles and responsibilities for individuals and organizations is essential to ensure timely and efficient responses to emergencies. This may involve assigning tasks such as incident reporting, emergency response coordination, on-site management, medical assistance, and external communication to respective teams or personnel. 4. Training and capacity-building: Regular training and capacity-building exercises should be provided to personnel at all levels of the project. This enables efficient handling of emergencies, familiarity with response strategies and respective roles, and improved overall project safety. 5. Continual improvement and review: Emergency planning should not be treated as a one-time event, but rather as an ongoing process. Regular reviews and updates to the plan should be conducted in light of new information, project changes or regulatory requirements, to continually improve the project's preparedness for emergencies. Understanding and complying with emergency planning requirements within the EIA process is crucial for minimizing the risk of adverse impacts on human health and the environment. It ensures that adequate measures are put in place to handle emergencies in a timely and efficient manner, ultimately safeguarding both people and the environment during the course of a project."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Opt for a color that blends with your siding to make the house seem larger. Plan around architectural features, like dormers and sloped roofs.\\" Article:","output":"Title: Making Your House Look Beautiful with Unique Roof Shingles Hello, little friends! Today, we'll learn about how to make your house look even more amazing using different types of roof shingles. Shingles are like the clothes your house wears on top. Just like you choose stylish clothes to look great, we can choose different designs or shapes for our roof shingles to make our house stand out.  1. Shingle Design and Shape: Let's start by talking about the design or shape of the roof shingles. Some houses have lots of small shingles that look like fish scales. Others have bigger ones that look like puzzle pieces. By picking a cool design or shape, we can make our house really stand out and say, \\"Hey, look at me! I'm special!\\" 2. Materials: Just like our clothes can be made of different fabrics, like cotton or wool, roof shingles can also be made of different materials. Some of the most beautiful shingles are made from clay, slate, or wood. Each of these materials makes your house look different and unique.  Clay shingles can make your house look old-fashioned and charming, like a cozy little cottage. Slate is a heavy type of stone that has been used for a long time, making your house look strong and grand. Wooden shingles are natural and make your house look all warm and friendly, like a big hug! 3. Colors: Choosing the right color for your roof shingles is important too. If we want our house to look bigger and more spacious, we can pick a color that is similar to the color of the walls (the siding) of our house. For example, if your house is painted light blue, you might choose shingles that are also light blue or gray. This makes everything look connected and creates a bigger-looking house. 4. Plan Around Your House Features: Every house is different and has its own special features, just like each one of us has something special and unique about us. Some houses have things called dormers (like little windows that stick out from the roof) or sloped roofs that go up and down.  When choosing our roof shingles, we should think about these special features and make sure our shingles will look great with them. Maybe we want to use a special pattern around the dormers or choose shingles that flow nicely along the sloped roofs. This way, our house will look like everything works well together, and it will be even more beautiful! So, little friends, now you know how we can make a statement with our roof shingles. Remember, just like choosing cool clothes to wear, we can choose unique designs, materials, colors, and plans to make our house look amazing!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: An optimal decision is a decision that leads to at least as good a known or expected outcome as all other available decision options. It is an important concept in decision theory. In order to compare the different decision outcomes, one commonly assigns a utility value to each of them. If there is uncertainty as to what the outcome will be, then under the von Neumann–Morgenstern axioms the optimal decision maximizes the expected utility (a probability–weighted average of utility over all possible outcomes of a decision).  John and Keith are playing a decision making game. They have three decisions to make decision A, decision B, and decision C. Decision A and decision B have certain outcome, but decision C's outcome is uncertain. John would apply optimal decision making process while Keith would rather rely on his hunches.  Who would most likely assign a utility value to each of the decisions, John or keith? Answer:","output":"John would most likely assign a utility value to each of the decisions. Since he applies the optimal decision-making process, he would try to make decisions based on rational evaluation and calculations, which involve assigning utility values to each of the options. On the other hand, Keith relies more on his hunches and intuition, which means he may not necessarily assign a utility value to each decision.

Until then, education in Ireland was largely dominated by religious persuasion, particularly the voluntary secondary school system was a particular realisation of this. The comprehensive school system is still relatively small and to an extent has been superseded by the community school concept. The Irish word for a comprehensive school is a 'scoil chuimsitheach.'

In what year was the Rokeby Venus badly destroyed?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  The Rokeby Venus (; also known as The Toilet of Venus, Venus at her Mirror, Venus and Cupid, or  La Venus del espejo) is a painting by Diego Velázquez, the leading artist of the Spanish Golden Age.  Completed between 1647 and 1651, and probably painted during the artist's visit to Italy, the work depicts the goddess Venus in a sensual pose, lying on a bed and looking into a mirror held by the Roman god of physical love, her son Cupid. The painting is in the National Gallery, London. Numerous works, from the ancient to the baroque, have been cited as sources of inspiration for Velázquez. The nude Venuses of the Italian painters, such as Giorgione's Sleeping Venus (c. 1510) and Titian's Venus of Urbino (1538), were the main precedents. In this work, Velázquez combined two established poses for Venus: recumbent on a couch or a bed, and gazing at a mirror. She is often described as looking at herself on the mirror, although this is physically impossible since viewers can see her face reflected in their direction. This phenomenon is known as the Venus effect. In a number of ways the painting represents a pictorial departure, through its central use of a mirror, and because it shows the body of Venus turned away from the observer of the painting.The Rokeby Venus is the only surviving female nude by Velázquez. Nudes were extremely rare in seventeenth-century Spanish art, which was policed actively by members of the Spanish Inquisition. Despite this, nudes by foreign artists were keenly collected by the court circle, and this painting was hung in the houses of Spanish courtiers until 1813, when it was brought to England to hang in Rokeby Park, Yorkshire. In 1906, the painting was purchased by National Art Collections Fund for the National Gallery, London. Although it was attacked and badly damaged in 1914 by the suffragette Mary Richardson, it soon was fully restored and returned to display.","output":"The Rokeby Venus was badly destroyed in 1914, as mentioned in the context provided.

League One underdogs Peterhead and Alloa Athletic have defied expectations by progressing through to the last 16 of the Scottish League Cup as group winners. This achievement not only brings joy to their loyal fanbases, but also adds a layer of excitement to the competition, demonstrating that even the lower-ranked teams can challenge the giants of Scottish football. Peterhead's Rise to the Top: Peterhead, a fishing town in the North East of Scotland, might not be the first place that comes to mind when discussing Scottish football prowess. However, the team's journey to the last 16 of the Scottish League Cup proves that they should not be taken lightly. Led by manager Jim McInally, the club fought hard to overcome the odds, demonstrating resilience, determination, and formidable teamwork. The Blue Toon's journey began with a strong start, winning their opening match against Cove Rangers and then carrying on that momentum to secure crucial victories against Raith Rovers and Falkirk. The consistency of their performances led to Peterhead topping their group with a total of nine points, surprising fans and analysts alike.  Key players like forward Rory McAllister and midfielder Scott Brown have been instrumental in the team's success, showcasing incredible skill, creativity, and determination. Peterhead's strong defensive strategy has also been a factor, with goalkeeper Joshua Rae proving to be crucial in tight situations.

Fans of Scottish football will be eagerly anticipating the next chapter of their ongoing journey. Conclusion: The progress of Peterhead and Alloa Athletic in this year's Scottish League Cup is not just a reflection of their hard work and determination, but also an illustration of the fact that football is as much about heart, passion, and unity as it is about skill and resources.

The residents have all heard about the chilling stories, but none dare to venture inside. The city officials have denied any reports of supernatural occurrences and have stated that the park is closed due to ongoing renovation and preservation projects. Our protagonist, John Hart, is an eager, aspiring investigative journalist seeking an opportunity to make his name in the field of journalism. He comes across a strange file on his late father's computer, which sparks his interest in the Forbidden Terrain. His father, a former respected journalist, had archived a collection of documents hinting at a clandestine project underway in the forest park. Intrigued, John sets out to unravel the mystery behind the Forbidden Terrain, but to do so, he needs permission to enter the restricted area.

As he delves deeper into the forest, he encounters several challenges, including trespassing local gangs, treacherous terrain, and the appearance of inexplicable supernatural phenomena. However, in the heart of the forest, he discovers an abandoned, underground facility that appears to be the hub of all the strange happenings.

John captures video footage of the facility and its ongoing experiments, planning to expose the horrific truth to the world. However, his actions attract the attention of The Enclave's ruthless security forces, led by enigmatic Commander Stern. With his life in danger and the evidence in his possession, John is forced to make a daring escape from the forest park, narrowly evading capture. In a thrilling finale, John returns to the city with the evidence he has collected, making his way to the Commissioner's office and revealing the truth behind The Forbidden Terrain.

Bach structured the cantata in eight movements: an instrumental sinfonia and seven vocal movements corresponding to the stanzas of the hymn. The duration is given as 22 minutes.The title of the original parts of the first Leipzig performance is (in Johann Christoph Altnickol's handwriting): \\"Feria Paschatos / Christ lag in Todes Banden / a.4. Voc: / Cornetto / 3 Trombon. / 2 Violini / 2 Viole / con / Continuo / Di Sign. Joh.Seb.Bach\\", In this late version, Bach scored the work for four vocal parts (soprano (S), alto (A), tenor (T), and bass (B)), and a Baroque instrumental ensemble consisting of strings, brass and continuo. The brass parts, a choir of cornetto (Ct) and three trombones (Tb) playing colla parte with the voices at times, may have been added in the 1720s. They may also possibly represent the original scoring, in the style of the 17th-century polychoral tradition.The scoring of the cantata Christ lag in Todes Banden has been described as \\"archaic\\" and its style \\"medieval\\": The string section consists of two violin parts (Vl) and two viola parts (VA); this indicates an older practice as for instance found in 17th-century church cantatas by Bach's ancestors (see Altbachisches Archiv), and in Jesus Christus ist um unsrer Missetat willen verwundet, a Passion setting from the early 18th century (or older) which Bach had performed a few years after composing the cantata Christ lag in Todes Banden. In the first half of the 18th century the standard for a string section soon evolved to two violin parts, one viola part and continuo. The cornett used in the cantata was an instrument that belonged to an earlier age: by the second quarter of the 18th century it had almost entirely disappeared from Bach's compositions. The brass instruments were only used for the 1 April 1725 version of the work.  The other performances (24 April 1707, 8 April 1708, and 9 April 1724) were performed without brass instruments (i.e., Cornetto and three Trombones).

To replace long-time member Vrenna, Reznor held open auditions to find a new drummer, eventually picking then-unknown Jerome Dillon.  Dillon would remain a member of the live band until 2005. Nine Inch Nails' record label at the time, Interscope Records, reportedly refused to fund the promotional tour following The Fragile's lukewarm sales.  Reznor instead committed himself to fund the entire tour out of his own pocket, concluding that \\"The reality is, I’m broke at the end of the tour,\\" but also adding \\"I will never present a show that isn’t fantastic.\\"The Fragility tour began in late 1999, running until mid-2000, and was broken into two major legs, Fragility 1.0 and Fragility 2.0 respectively.  Destinations included Europe, Japan, New Zealand, Australia, and North America.  Before the first Fragility performance date in Spain, Nine Inch Nails opened their final rehearsal in London to 100 fans. Kick-starting the tour was a performance of the title track from The Fragile at the MTV Video Music Awards.  Atari Teenage Riot opened for Nine Inch Nails during Fragility 1.0, and A Perfect Circle for Fragility 2.0.  At the time, A Perfect Circle featured Josh Freese on drums, who would later replace Dillon and play drums for Nine Inch Nails from 2005 to 2007. The tour featured increasingly large production values, including a triptych video display created by contemporary video artist Bill Viola. Rolling Stone magazine named Fragility the best tour of 2000.In 2002, the tour documentary And All That Could Have Been was released featuring a collection of performances from the Fragility 2.0 tour.  While making the DVD, Reznor commented on the tour in retrospect by saying \\"I thought the show was really, really good when we were doing it\\", but later admitted that he \\"can't watch [the DVD] at all.... A:","output":"The name of the drummer on the Self-Destruct tour was Chris Vrenna. The context provided discusses that Jerome Dillon replaced Vrenna for the Fragility tour, which indicates that Vrenna was the drummer during the previous Self-Destruct tour."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What's the most logical way to complete this passage? New York (CNN) -- Walter Cronkite was not the best educated or the best dressed or even the best looking of the generation of World War II correspondents who dominated the early days of television news. His wife once told Parade magazine that he looked, in a way, like your family dentist, which was not all that surprising since his father and his grandfather were dentists. Yet Cronkite was picked in 1962 to anchor the \\"CBS Evening News,\\" and for two of the most tumultuous decades in American history, he was the authoritative voice of news in America, the man who told viewers that President John F. Kennedy had been assassinated, that men had walked on the moon and that the Vietnam War couldn't be won. In an era when television news was the province of the Big Three broadcast networks and cable news hadn't been invented yet, the anchor chair at OPTIONS: - America was an especially influential platform. - American was an especially influential platform. - Americans was an especially influential platform. - Big Three was an especially influential platform. - Brinkley was an especially influential platform. - CBS Evening News was an especially influential platform. - CNN was an especially influential platform. - Cronkite was an especially influential platform. - Douglas Brinkley was an especially influential platform. - John F. Kennedy was an especially influential platform. - New York was an especially influential platform. - Parade magazine was an especially influential platform. - Vietnam War was an especially influential platform. - Walter Cronkite was an especially influential platform. - World War II was an especially influential platform.","output":"Step 1: Identify the subject of the passage. The passage is about Walter Cronkite and his role as the anchor of the \\"CBS Evening News.\\" Step 2: Determine the main point of the passage. The main point is that Walter Cronkite was an authoritative voice in American news during his time, despite not being the best educated, dressed, or looking among his peers. Step 3: Evaluate which option best fits the missing part. The missing part should reflect the importance of the anchor chair that Cronkite held in the context of the passage. Step 4: Choose the best option. Out of all the available options, \\"CBS Evening News was an especially influential platform\\" best fits the missing part, as it emphasizes the significance of Cronkite's position during his time as the anchor. So, the most logical way to complete the passage would be: In an era when television news was the province of the Big Three broadcast networks and cable news hadn't been invented yet, the anchor chair at CBS Evening News was an especially influential platform."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Samuel has a few dogs running around their house while Adam has no pets.","output":"Although Samuel and Adam share many common interests, their preferences for pets differ significantly. Samuel has a deep passion for animals, which is evident in the way he has designed his home as a haven for his beloved pets. With a few dogs running around his house, Samuel has found a great source of companionship and joy in the presence of his furry friends. The spacious arrangement of Samuel's home, the carefully chosen flooring, and the specially designed play areas are all testaments to Samuel's devotion to ensuring the well-being of his pets. Samuel also takes great pride in creating a harmonious environment that not only nurtures his dogs' physical needs but also caters to their emotional and mental well-being. These pets have become an essential part of his daily life, and Samuel thrives on the unconditional love and trust they provide. In contrast, Adam loves animals but does not own any pets. There could be a variety of reasons behind this. First, he may not have the necessary time and resources to dedicate to properly caring for a pet. With modern life's fast-paced nature and various commitments, such as work and family, owning a pet can be challenging for some individuals. Adam may also be aware of the significant responsibility that comes with being a pet owner, and perhaps he has decided that the timing is not right. Another possible reason for Adam's lack of pets at home is allergies or health concerns. For example, Adam may be allergic to pet dander, in which case owning a pet would be detrimental to his health. Other health-related concerns could involve family members or frequent visitors who may have allergies or other risks that pets may pose. Lastly, Adam may be content with simply interacting with animals outside of owning a pet. This could include going on nature walks and observing wildlife, visiting farms and sanctuaries, and even volunteering at animal shelters in his spare time. In this way, Adam can enjoy the company of animals without the substantial responsibility that accompanies owning a pet. In summary, while both Samuel and Adam love animals, their lifestyle choices and personal circumstances have led to their differing pet ownership situations. Samuel, who cherishes the presence of his dogs, has taken considerable steps to create a loving and safe environment for them. On the other hand, Adam, although animal-loving, does not own any pets due to various reasons such as lack of time, resources, health-related concerns, or an alternative way of engaging with animals. Regardless of these differences, their shared love for animals fosters empathy and appreciation for the natural world around them."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Question 2: Is the mean for a stable distribution the same as  the mean for Gaussian or normal distribution when the index of stability, alpha >1? Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","output":"Question 1: What is the difference between Gaussian and normal distribution? The Gaussian distribution, also known as the normal distribution, is a continuous probability distribution. They are essentially the same thing, with the terms used interchangeably. This distribution has a unique bell-shaped curve, which is symmetric around its mean and characterized by its mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ).  The probability density function (PDF) of the Gaussian distribution is given by the formula: f(x) = (1 / √(2πσ^2)) * e^(-(x - μ)^2 / (2σ^2)) Where x is the variable, μ is the mean, and σ is the standard deviation. The peak of the curve corresponds to the mean, and the spread of the curve is determined by the standard deviation.  The Gaussian distribution is vital in statistics, as it often approximates the distribution of random variables and provides a foundation for numerous statistical tests, including hypothesis testing or regression analysis. It is also essential in understanding the Central Limit Theorem as it states that the sum of a large number of independent and identically distributed random variables approaches a Gaussian distribution, regardless of the original distribution of the random variables. Question 2: Is the mean for a stable distribution the same as the mean for Gaussian or normal distribution when the index of stability, alpha >1? A stable distribution is a family of continuous probability distributions, which is defined by four parameters: the location parameter (μ), the scale parameter (σ), the skewness parameter (β), and the index of stability (α). Stable distributions provide a generalization of several well-known distributions, including the Gaussian distribution, Cauchy distribution, and Lévy distribution. The mean of a stable distribution can be very different from the mean of a Gaussian distribution. Stable distributions are defined by their characteristic functions. Importantly, stable distributions have finite values for mean and variance when the index of stability α > 1. When 0 < α < 1, the mean and variance can be infinite and thus not well-defined. When α = 2, the stable distribution converges to a Gaussian distribution, so the mean would be the same. For 1 < α ≤ 2, the mean of a stable distribution will generally differ from the mean of a Gaussian distribution, as the properties of the distribution depend on the location, scale, skewness, and the index of stability parameters. To answer your final question, no, questions 1 and 2 are not asking the same thing. Question 1 is asking about the difference between Gaussian and normal distribution, which are essentially two names for the same distribution. Question 2, on the other hand, is exploring the comparison of the mean values between stable distributions and Gaussian distribution under a specific condition (when the index of stability α >1). These questions are about distinct aspects of the probability distribution concepts in statistics."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer:","output":"Jorge de la Vega is best categorized under the \\"artist\\" category. Born in Buenos Aires, Argentina, in 1930, de la Vega was an influential and versatile Latin American artist primarily known for his work in painting and drawing. He was a key member of the Nueva Figuración (New Figuration) movement in Argentina during the 1960s, a time characterized by political tensions and artistic experimentation in Latin America. Jorge de la Vega's artwork reflected the social and political context of his time, often engaging in themes of alienation and anguish experienced by individuals living under oppressive regimes. His style was characterized by a confluence of abstraction and figuration, combining expressionist, neo-figurative, and neo-surrealist elements. Over the years, he explored various mediums, including painting, drawing, collage, and assemblage, while experimenting with tonal ranges and compositions. In addition to his artistic practice, de la Vega was a trained architect and musician, which contributed to his interdisciplinary approach to art. His depictions were often populated by fantastical figures, striving to address the human condition and the complexities of modern society. His work has been exhibited and collected worldwide, with a lasting impact on the Latin American art scene.

This is an important step in the process since it will help them transition smoothly into their new living situation and allow them to have access to all their personal items while staying with their parents. First, Aubrey should take some time to reflect on what they want to bring with them to their parents' house and what items they may be able to leave behind, sell, or donate. They should consider the space available at their parents' home and only take what they truly need or find essential. Once they have an idea of what belongings they want to bring with them, Aubrey should start sorting their items by category. This process will make it easier for them to pack their belongings efficiently and ensure that everything is organized and easily accessible when they unpack at their parents' house. Typical categories could include clothing, shoes, books, electronics, kitchen items, and toiletries. Aubrey should also take this opportunity to declutter their belongings and get rid of any items they no longer need or use. This could mean donating items to charity, selling them online, or simply disposing of them responsibly. By decluttering, Aubrey will be able to focus on the essentials and make their move as smooth and streamlined as possible. Next, Aubrey should start packing their belongings into appropriate containers. They can use cardboard boxes, plastic bins, or even bags and suitcases, as long as they provide enough protection and organization for their items. It's essential to label each container with its contents and the room it belongs in, making the unpacking process easier when they arrive at their parents' house. Aubrey should also take care to pack breakable and valuable items properly to prevent any damage during the move. They can wrap these items in bubble wrap, packing paper, or even soft fabrics like blankets and towels. Additionally, it's essential to communicate with their parents about any large items or furniture pieces they plan on bringing, so that adequate space and arrangements can be made at their parents' home. Once everything is packed, Aubrey should arrange for transportation of their belongings to their parents' house. They can either rent a moving truck, enlist the help of friends with vehicles, or hire professional movers to assist with the heavy lifting. Finally, it's essential for Aubrey to communicate openly with their parents about any concerns or expectations they may have regarding living together. This can help address any potential issues before they arise and may even foster a more harmonious living environment that will make this difficult life transition a bit easier for everyone involved."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The man was previously released from jail in February last year under strict bail conditions. Step 1: Discuss the arrest and raid On Thursday, the man was led away in handcuffs from his North London home after a raid by specialist counter-terrorism officers. The reason for the arrest and raid remains undisclosed by the authorities, raising serious concerns amidst the community. Step 2: Highlight his previous imprisonment and release The individual was previously imprisoned, but was released in February last year under strict bail conditions. It is currently unclear whether he had violated these bail conditions that led to the recent arrest, or if he is facing new charges. Step 3: Discuss his legal aid and battle with the government During his ten-year struggle with the government, the North London man received over £500,000 in legal aid. Legal aid is a government funded program designed to help individuals who cannot afford to pay for legal representation in court. However, it has become a topic of public debate, with some people arguing that it should be limited to those who truly need financial assistance. Step 4: Analyze the consequences of the arrest on public opinion and concerns This recent arrest highlights the growing concerns around terrorism in the UK. The use of specialist counter-terrorism officers during the raid indicates that the authorities are taking this matter seriously. It also raises questions about the efficiency of the legal aid system, given that £500,000 was spent on this individual's legal battle with the government. Step 5: Conclusion In conclusion, the undisclosed reason for the arrest and the involvement of specialist counter-terrorism officers in the North London man's case have sparked both public concern and debate. Some argue that the significant sum of money spent on legal aid for this individual could have been allocated to more deserving cases or services. As more information becomes available, it will be crucial to analyze its implications on the legal aid system and counter-terrorism efforts in the UK."},{"instruction":"Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: A young woman walks through the hallways of an apartment building, looking for \\"Mr. Gunther\\".

Escapes - Visiting the Edgar Allan Poe Museum in Richmond - washingtonpost.com It was a dark and gloomy day when I undertook my Edgar Allan Poe pilgrimage, my soul filled with a rising dread for the unknown horrors I felt awaited me. Ever since discovering I shared a birthday with the great writer, I had become convinced that some malign influence was ineluctably drawing me to the hideous heart of a foul, unspeakable mystery. And in 2009, the bicentennial of his birth, there will be more reason than ever to go to Richmond, where he lived a third of his life. In various cities he lived in or visited, there will be exhibitions, book signings, lectures and performances, but the heart of the mania will be Richmond's Edgar Allan Poe Museum, which claims the world's finest collection of Poe manuscripts, letters, first editions and personal belongings. I tried in vain to think of another writer who has remained so popular for so long. Only Shakespeare and Dickens came to mind, and my purpose remained clear. All those Poe poems and stories came flooding back, haunting me with their cunning titles: \\"The Raven,\\" \\"Annabel Lee,\\" \\"The Pit and the Pendulum,\\" \\"The Tell-Tale Heart,\\" \\"The Cask of Amontillado,\\" \\"The Fall of the House of Usher.\\" On arriving in Richmond, my eyes fell upon a decrepit building at 15th and Main streets. The site had once held the offices of the Southern Literary Messenger, where Poe, as editor, began to establish a lasting reputation. The building now houses a seedy \\"gentleman's club.\\" Was this, I wondered, a subtle clue, or simply a mocking symbol of depravity? It scarcely mattered, because as I in morbid fascination entered the old Shockoe Bottom neighborhood, looking for that air of decay that had lately hung over this erstwhile commercial area, I was mildly disappointed. The late-19th-century tobacco warehouses and factories have been converted into restaurants, nightclubs, shops and apartments. All very nice . . . yet (I smiled inwardly) still retaining an unvarnished flavor of antiquity. A few blocks away, the Poe Museum is centered on a decidedly pre-Poe building, the Old Stone House. Dating from the mid-1700s, it's the oldest residence in Richmond, and though Poe didn't live here, he would certainly have recognized it. A camellia was blooming when I visited, though the rose bushes were bare. Exhibits are located in the house and three other buildings. One exhibit details Poe's early life and includes his narrow bed and furniture from his foster parents' house. Poe's father abandoned his mother when the boy was 2; his mother died of tuberculosis the following year when she was in Richmond with a traveling theater company. Tobacco merchant John Allan and his wife took in Poe and gave him the best schooling money could buy. As a young boy Poe may have been a satisfactory addition to the household, but Allan described the teenage Poe as \\"that damn actor's son,\\" a \\"quite miserable, sulky, & ill-tempered\\" youth. He excluded Poe from his will. In fact, as museum director Kat Spears told me, Poe was a complex character, torn between his poor roots and his privileged upbringing. His early friends remembered him as a leader who often got his followers in trouble, a young man who was by turns capricious, imperious and generous, yet \\"not steadily kind or even amiable.\\" He famously married his 13-year-old cousin when he was 27; she would die at age 24, another crushing blow. As for his reputation as a drunk, Spears maintains that such a depiction is incomplete: \\"A lot of young people who come here . . . sometimes have the idea that alcohol makes you more creative. What we stress is that he was a disciplined writer: He didn't drink and write.\\" She likens his mood swings to bipolar behavior. \\"He drank to buoy himself at times.\\" Spears told me this as we stood in a room that holds samples of his tight, neat handwriting and a leather trunk that contained nearly all his worldly belongings: clothes, a mirror and manuscripts. It was left in his room in Richmond when he took a trip to Philadelphia in 1849. After stopping in Baltimore for reasons unknown, Poe was found outside a tavern in a delirium. He was taken to a hospital and, never regaining full consciousness, died four days later, at age 40; the coroner termed the cause of death \\"congestion of the brain.\\" Over the years various theories regarding his death have been proposed: epilepsy, rabies, heart attack, diabetes, alcohol poisoning and murder, to name but a few. There is no definitive answer, nor is there an answer to the mystery of Poe the man, though the museum helps you understand him better. I ended my tour in the gift shop, amid Poe action figures and shot glasses. I asked museum curator Chris Semtner why people still care about Poe after two centuries. \\"His works are still modern,\\" he said. \\"Everybody has to read him in school, and he's the first writer they actually like. His works explore the deepest recesses of the human mind. He's the quintessential outsider and rebel, and people sympathize with that.\\" Events and education coordinator Kappy Anklam could not help chipping in her thoughts, noting that lots of Goths visit the museum, attracted by Poe's obsession with the weird and morbid. The museum plans a 24-hour birthday bash on Jan. 19. But any time is a good time to go to Richmond and delve into America's first great lyric poet, inventor of the modern detective story and early master of the macabre. As for myself, from that numinous chamber I fled, aghast. I cannot give tongue to what I found there. Yet I would not hesitate to return. What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"The writer shares their experience of visiting the Edgar Allan Poe Museum in Richmond. The museum has a large collection of Poe's manuscripts, letters, first editions, and personal belongings. It showcases details about his early life, including his education and relationships.

Article: Bill Javis took over our village news-agency at a time of life when most of us only want to relax. He just thought he would like something but not too much to do, and the news-agency was ready-made. The business produced little enough for him, but Bill was a man who only wanted the simplicity and order and regularity of the job. He had been a long-serving sailor, and all his life had done everything by the clock. Every day he opened his shop at six a.m. to catch the early trade; the papers arrived on his door-step before that. Many of Bill's customers were city workers, and the shop was convenient for the station. Business was _ by 10 o'clock, so at eleven sharp Bill closed for lunch. It was hard luck on anybody who wanted a paper or magazine in the afternoon, for most likely Bill would be down on the river bank, fishing, and his nearest competitor was five kilometers away. Sometime in the afternoon, the evening paper landed on the doormat, and at 4 o'clock Bill reopened. The evening rush lasted till seven, and it was worthwhile. He lived in a flat above the shop, alone. Except in the very bad weather, you always knew where to find him in the afternoon, as I have said. Once, on a sunny afternoon, I walked home along the river bank from a shopping trip to the village. By my watch it was three minutes past four, so I was astonished to see Bill sitting there on his little chair with a line in the water. He had had no luck, I could see, but he was making no effort to move. \\"What's wrong, Bill?\\" I called out from the path. For answer, he put a hand in his jacket and took out a big, golden object. For a moment I had no idea what it could be, and then it suddenly went off with a noise like a fire engine. Stopping the bell, Bill held the thing up and called back, \\"Ten to four, you see, and this is dead right.\\" I had never known anyone carrying a brass alarm clock round with him before. Question: Bill opened the shop so early in the day because   _  . Options: A: he liked to do as much as possible before he went to work B: the shop had to be open when the morning papers came C: he was never sure of time D: it was then that he did a lot of business A:","output":"The correct answer is D: it was then that he did a lot of business. The article mentions that Bill Javis opened his news-agency at six in the morning to catch the early trade since his shop was conveniently located for city workers who were on their way to the station. So, it seems that opening the shop early in the morning allowed him to cater to this group of customers, thus doing a lot of business during these hours. Even though the papers arrive before he opens the shop (which could suggest option B), the article clearly states that his customer base mainly consists of city workers who most probably pick up their papers on their way to work in the morning. Therefore, the main reason for opening early seems to be to cater to these city workers – hence option D being the best answer. Option A could be misleading as there's no detail suggesting that Bill liked to do a lot before working in the shop, and option C is not relevant since Bill was actually very punctual, as emphasized by his habit of carrying an alarm clock around with him."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Tsugumo HanshirÅ arrives at the estate of the Ii clan and says that he wishes to commit seppuku within the courtyard of the palace. To deter him SaitÅ Kageyu (RentarÅ Mikuni), the Daimyo's senior counselor, tells HanshirÅ the story of another rÅnin, Chijiiwa Motome â formerly of the same clan as HanshirÅ. Motome arrived at the palace a few months earlier and made the same request as HanshirÅ. Infuriated by the rising number of \\"suicide bluffs\\", the three most senior samurai of the clanâYazaki Hayato, Kawabe Umenosuke, and Omodaka Hikokuroâpersuaded SaitÅ to force Motome to follow through and kill himself. Upon examining Motome's swords, their blades were found to be made of bamboo. Enraged that any samurai would \\"pawn his soul\\", the House of Ii forced Motome to disembowel himself with his own bamboo blade, making his death slow, agonizingly painful, and deeply humiliating. Despite this warning, HanshirÅ insists that he has never heard of Motome and says that he has no intention of leaving the Ii palace alive. After a suicide pavilion is set up in the courtyard of the palace, HanshirÅ is asked to name the samurai who shall behead him when the ritual is complete. To the shock of SaitÅ and the Ii retainers, HanshirÅ successively names Hayato, Umenosuke, and Hikokuroâthe three samurai who coerced the suicide of Motome. When messengers are dispatched to summon them, all three decline to come, saying they are suffering from a life-threatening illness. After provoking their laughter by calling bushido a facade, HanshirÅ recounts his story to SaitÅ and the Ii retainers. He did, he admits, know Motome after all. In 1619, his clan was abolished by the Shogun. His Lord decided to commit seppuku and, as his most senior samurai, HanshirÅ planned to die alongside him.

Input: Context: The main objective of the present study was the investigation of possible influence of lens opacification on macular pigment optical density (MPOD) measurements.', 'Eighty-six eyes of 64 patients (mean age 73.4 ± 8.3 years) were included in the study. MPOD was prospectively measured using the one-wavelength reflection method (Visucam500, Carl Zeiss Meditec AG) before and after cataract extraction, with implantation of a blue-light filtering intraocular lens (AlconSN60WF). The median of the maximum optical density (MaxOD) and the median of the mean optical density (MeanOD) measurements of macular pigment across the subject group were evaluated.', 'Statistically significant differences were noticed between pre-operative and post-operative measurements, the absolute values were generally lower after cataract extraction. The following median (lower/upper quartile) differences across the group were determined: MaxOD -33.8 % (-46.2 to -19.1 %), MeanOD -44.0 % (-54.6 to -26.6 %). Larger changes were observed in elderly patients [<70 years of age (nu2009=u200925 eyes): MaxOD -13.4 % (-20.5 to 3.6 %), MeanOD -23.6 % (-30.5 to -15.3 %) versus patients ≥70 years (nu2009=u200961 eyes) MaxOD -40.5 % (-53.2 to -30.1 %), MeanOD -47.2 % (-57.8 to -40.1 %)] and in patients with progressed stage of cataract. MaxOD for lens opacification grade 1 (nu2009=u20099 eyes): -27.4 % (-42.1 to -19.6 %), grade 2 (nu2009=u200926 eyes): -35.0 % (-44.2 to -25.3 %), grade 3 (nu2009=u200921 eyes): -34.4 % (-45.4 to -11.4 %), grade 4 (nu2009=u200925 eyes): -32.6 % (-53.2 to -6.4 %), and grade 5 (nu2009=u20095 eyes): -53.5 % (-61.7 to -38.7 %) and MeanOD for cataract stage 1 (nu2009=u20099 eyes): -42.6 % (-46.0 to -26.0 %), stage 2 (nu2009=u200926 eyes): -44.1 % (-51.8 to -26.2 %), stage 3 (nu2009=u200921 eyes): -45.7 % (-54.7 to -24.7 %), stage 4 (nu2009=u200925 eyes): -39.5 % (-59.4 to -26.1 %), and stage 5 (nu2009=u20095 eyes): -57.0 % (-66.1 to -51.4 %). Answer: As established by comparison of pre- to post-operative measurements, cataract presented a strong effect on MPOD measured by one-wavelength reflection method. Particular care should therefore be taken when evaluating MPOD using this method in elderly patients with progressed stage of cataract. Future optimization of correcting parameters of scattered light and consideration of cataract influence may allow more precise evaluation of MPOD.

How do you do this: To prevent cookies from burning.","output":"To prevent cookies from burning, follow these step-by-step instructions: 1. Choose the right recipe: Start by selecting a recipe that has been tested and reviewed by others. This ensures that the measurements and cooking times are correct, which can help prevent burning. 2. Measure ingredients accurately: Carefully measure all the ingredients, as too much sugar or butter can cause the cookies to burn. Using a kitchen scale for measuring dry ingredients can improve accuracy. 3. Preheat the oven: Preheat your oven to the temperature specified in the recipe. An oven that is too hot can cause cookies to burn quickly. 4. Use a light-colored baking sheet: Dark-colored baking sheets can absorb more heat and may lead to burnt cookies. Choose light-colored or aluminum baking sheets for more even heating. 5. Line your baking sheet: Line your baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat. This prevents cookies from sticking to the sheet and makes it easier to remove them without breaking, which can help prevent overcooking. 6. Space cookies properly: Leave enough space between each cookie on the baking sheet, as this allows for proper heat distribution and prevents the edges from burning. 7. Be mindful of baking time: Pay close attention to the baking time specified in the recipe. Begin checking cookies a few minutes before the given time to prevent overbaking. Note that oven temperatures may vary, so it's essential to know your oven. 8. Use an oven thermometer: To ensure that your oven is heating to the correct temperature, consider using an oven thermometer. This can help you adjust the heat accordingly to prevent burning. 9. Rotate the baking sheet: Halfway through the baking time, rotate the sheet 180 degrees to ensure even cooking and reduce the risk of burning. 10. Transfer cookies immediately: Once the cookies are done, remove them from the oven and gently slide the parchment paper or silicone mat onto a wire cooling rack. This prevents the cookies from continuing to cook on the hot baking sheet. By following these steps and being attentive to your cookies as they bake, you can minimize the risk of burning and ensure they come out perfectly cooked and delicious."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Scottish traveler James Bruce reported in 1770 that Medri Bahri was a distinct political entity from Abyssinia, noting that the two territories were frequently in conflict. The Bahre-Nagassi (\\"Kings of the Sea\\") alternately fought with or against the Abyssinians and the neighbouring Muslim Adal Sultanate depending on the geopolitical circumstances. Medri Bahri was thus part of the Christian resistance against Imam Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi of Adal's forces, but later joined the Adalite states and the Ottoman Empire front against Abyssinia in 1572. That 16th century also marked the arrival of the Ottomans, who began making inroads in the Red Sea area. Answer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What determined whether The Bahre-Nagassi fought with or against the Abyssinians?","output":"The determination of whether the Bahre-Nagassi fought with or against the Abyssinians mainly depended on the geopolitical circumstances and the shifting balance of power in the region. There were several factors that influenced their alliances, some of which include: 1. Protection of territorial sovereignty: The Bahre-Nagassi, being the rulers of the Medri Bahri region, always aimed at protecting their territorial sovereignty. If they felt threatened by the Abyssinians or believed that an alliance with Abyssinia would compromise their interests, they would choose to fight against them. 2. Religious affiliations: While both the Medri Bahri and Abyssinian kingdoms shared a common Christian faith, which at times brought them together against the Muslim invasion, religious affiliations also played a role in determining alliances. If the Bahre-Nagassi saw an opportunity to strengthen their Christian position through an alliance with the Abyssinians, or if they faced a significant Muslim threat, such as during the campaigns of Imam Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi, they would join forces with Abyssinia. 3. Balance of power: Regional power dynamics influenced the Bahre-Nagassi's decision to side with or against the Abyssinians. If aligning with the Abyssinians would weaken a more formidable enemy or if the Bahre-Nagassi deemed the Abyssinian kingdom to be weakened and vulnerable, they might join forces or fight against them, respectively. 4. Influence of foreign powers: The arrival of the Ottomans in the Red Sea region and their increasing influence in the area played a significant role in shaping the alliances and conflicts between the Medri Bahri and the Abyssinians. The Bahre-Nagassi sided with the Adalite states and the Ottoman Empire against Abyssinia in 1572, reflecting the impact of foreign powers on their decision-making process. 5. Diplomatic relations and political marriages: Diplomatic relations between the two Christian kingdoms also played a part in determining their alliances or conflicts. Political marriages between the ruling families, the exchange of tributes, or agreements over the disputed territories often led to peaceful relations and alliances against common enemies. In conclusion, the determination of whether the Bahre-Nagassi fought with or against the Abyssinians was not based on a single factor, but rather on a complex interplay of various geopolitical circumstances, religious affiliations, the regional balance of power, and the influence of foreign powers. The Bahre-Nagassi's primary focus was to protect their own interests and sovereignty, and their alliances and conflicts were shaped accordingly."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the context: Why did Jesse do this? A:","output":"Given the context, it seems like Jesse decided to give Lee's girlfriend a ride home from the party with the ulterior motive of trying to woo or flirt with her. Although the motives behind a person's actions can vary widely and greatly depend on their morals, values, intentions, and emotions, in this given scenario, Jesse's actions seem to be driven by an attraction or interest towards Lee's girlfriend. According to the information provided, Jesse's decision to give Lee's girlfriend a ride home wasn't born from kindness, altruism, duty, or responsibility, but rather from an intention to try to make advances towards her. It could be that Jesse is attracted to Lee's girlfriend, and saw an opportunity to be alone with her to provide him with the chance to hit on her subtly or openly. This could mean anything from romantic gestures, flirtatious compliments, or the suggestion of interest that exceeds a platonic level. Taking her home from the party gave him a moment of privacy and it's likely that he used this as an opportunity to win her affections or express his feelings, possibly hoping to create a personal connection or foster a romantic interest in him. This could be perceived as a strategic move in Jesse's mind, believing it may increase his chances with her.  However, it's also key to note that attempting to hit on someone else's partner is generally regarded as disrespectful and improper. It disrupts existing relationships, and, depending on the circumstances, it may negatively impact the bonds between Lee, his girlfriend, and Jesse. Furthermore, the fact that Lee and Jesse know each other may complicate matters further, since if Lee discovers Jesse's intentions, it might strain or damage their relationship. So, in summary, Jesse gave Lee's girlfriend a ride home from the party because he fancied her and saw it as an opportunity to hit on her while they were alone. His action was guided by his attraction to her and his desire to create a romantic connection."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true?","output":"Whether the first sentence is true does not necessarily confirm the truth of the second sentence. The first sentence says that \\"Milopotamos is one of the best and busiest beaches in the Aegean.\\" This statement indicates that Milopotamos is a favored beach among many in the Aegean Sea region, attracting a significant number of visitors. However, the second sentence generalizes all beaches in the Aegean, saying that \\"All of the beaches on the Aegean are popular and busy.\\" Even though the first sentence tells us that Milopotamos is a popular and busy beach, this does not mean that all beaches on the Aegean Sea are also as popular or busy as Milopotamos.  The Aegean Sea, part of the eastern Mediterranean, is known for its large number of islands (and thus, beaches) divided between Greece and Turkey. While some are indeed popular tourist destinations known for their beauty, facilities, or historical significance like Milopotamos, others might be less well-known, less accessible, or less popular for a variety of reasons. For example, a beach might be less busy due to its remote location, lack of facilities, or absence of unique or appealing characteristics. In other words, just because one beach in the Aegean (Milopotamos) is bustling and popular does not mean that every other beach in the Aegean is the same. Popularity and visitor numbers can vary greatly from beach to beach, depending on multiple factors such as location, facilities, promotions by travel agencies, beauty of the beach, historical importance, and the presence of local or unique elements. Therefore, the truth of the first sentence does not guarantee the truth of the second sentence. The popularity and busyness of Milopotamos do not necessarily reflect the state of the rest of the beaches in the Aegean Sea. The second sentence would only be true if every single beach in the Aegean Sea was indeed popular and busy, which isn't stipulated or guaranteed by the information provided in the first sentence.

This proposition directly contradicts the hypothesis: \\"All problems are addressed in the plan.\\" In the logical framework of this scenario, if all problems were truly addressed in the plan, there would be no issues left unresolved. However, it is evident from the premise that this is not the case, as it points out the fact that the plan lack solutions for several ongoing issues flagged by the GSA Inspector General. Insofar as this specified context is concerned, the fact that some problems have been left untreated categorically negates the validity of the universal statement made in the hypothesis that 'All problems are addressed in the plan.' Generalized exposition as made in the hypothesis can only stand true if every single individual element it refers to adheres to the described condition. As it is apparent, a number of problems identified have not been addressed. Therefore, the hypothesis falls through, and the best-fit answer to the question 'does the premise entail the hypothesis that all problems are addressed in the plan' is 'No.'    An important aspect to remember when interpreting statements such as these is to note the absolutes, like 'all' in this case. The absolute condition leaves no room for exceptions. Therefore, even a single instance where the condition is not met provides suffice substantiation for the diction of the entire statement. As a result, the premise that the General Services Administration's fiscal year 2000 annual performance plan does not address certain ongoing problems directly contradicts and disaffirms the hypothesis that all problems are addressed in the plan.

The extra lumbar and thoracic vertebrae account for the cat's enhanced spinal mobility and flexibility, compared to humans. The caudal vertebrae form the tail, used by the cat as a counterbalance to the body during quick movements. Between their vertebrae, they have elastic discs, useful for cushioning the jump landings. OPT: 1. no 2. yes Is this statement correct \\"are there bones in a cat's tail\\"?","output":"Yes, this statement is correct. There are bones in a cat's tail. The bones in a cat's tail are called caudal vertebrae. Most cats have between 22 and 23 caudal vertebrae that form their tail. These vertebrae give the tail its structure and flexibility, allowing the cat to use it for balance and communication. Each vertebra is separated by an elastic disc which helps to cushion the impact during jumps or other sudden movements. In addition to the caudal vertebrae, a cat’s tail contains muscles, tendons, nerves, and blood vessels that all contribute to the tail's functionality. Cats use their tails for expressing emotions, maintaining balance, and enhancing agility while moving through their environment. It is important to note that some breeds of cats, such as the Manx, have shorter tails or possess no tail at all due to a genetic mutation. In these cases, the number of caudal vertebrae would be lesser than the typical range of 22 to 23 bones. Overall, the presence of bones in a cat's tail is a crucial element of a cat's anatomy, allowing it to navigate its surroundings with ease, convey emotions, and maintain balance."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What were the last names of the four people that led the march and formed a breakaway group? , can you please find it?   Shortly after the return home in November 1936 Riley, together with three other Jarrow councillors who had led the march—James Hanlon, Paddy Scullion and Joseph Symonds—left Labour to form a breakaway group committed to a more direct fight for employment. All four later rejoined the party; Scullion and Symonds both served as the town's mayor, and Symonds was Labour MP for Whitehaven from 1959 to 1970. In 1939 Wilkinson published her history of Jarrow, The Town that Was Murdered. A reviewer for The Economic Journal found the book \\"not quite as polemical as one might have expected\\", but felt that in her denunciation of the BISF Wilkinson had not taken full account of the state of the iron and steel industry in the 1930s. Wilkinson continued her parliamentary career, and from 1940 to 1945 held junior ministerial office in Churchill's wartime coalition government. In the 1945 Labour government she was appointed Minister of Education, with a seat in the cabinet, a post in which she served until her death, aged 55, in February 1947. In 1974 the rock singer Alan Price released  the \\"Jarrow Song\\", which helped to raise awareness of the events of 1936 among a new generation. Among dramatisations based on the Jarrow March is a play, Whistling at the Milestones (1977) by Alex Glasgow, and an opera, Burning Road (1996), by Will Todd and Ben Dunwell. In what Perry describes as one of the ironies surrounding the march, the opera was performed in Durham Cathedral in May 1997, in retrospective defiance of the bishop who had condemned the march. On 29 October 2017, the Tyne Bridge was closed off and was the venue the Freedom on The Tyne Finale. The Freedom on The Tyne Finale was the finale of the 2017 Freedom City festival. The event, promoted by Newcastle University re-enacted many world civil rights stories throughout history.

Title: The Constant Gardener Movie plot: Justin Quayle (Ralph Fiennes), a shy low-level British diplomat and horticultural hobbyist posted in Kenya, is one to avoid making a fuss until he learns that his wife Tessa (Rachel Weisz) was found dead in the veld. Tessa has been murdered at a crossroads along with her Kenyan driver. Her doctor colleague Arnold Bluhm (Hubert KoundÃ©) is initially suspected of her murder but is later found to have himself been murdered on the same day as Tessa. Various rumours abound that the two were having an affair; however, it is later revealed that Bluhm was gay. In flashbacks, we see how in London, Justin met his future wife Tessa, an outspoken humanitarian and Amnesty activist. He falls in love with her and she persuades him to take her back with him to Kenya. Despite their loving marriage, Tessa keeps from Justin the reason why she approached him in the first place - to investigate a suspicious drug trial in Kenya and expose it. When Tessa starts getting too close to uncovering the malpractices of an influential and powerful pharmaceutical company, she and her colleague are brutally murdered. As the mystery surrounding his wife's death unfolds, Justin becomes determined to get to the bottom of her murder. He soon runs up against a drug corporation that is using Kenya's population for fraudulent testing of a tuberculosis drug (\\"dypraxa\\"). The drug has known harmful side effects, but the corporation completely disregards the well-being of its poor African test subjects. Sir Bernard Pellegrin (Bill Nighy) is the head of the Africa Desk at the Foreign Office and he is the boss both of Justin and of the British High Commissioner, Sandy Woodrow (Danny Huston). In his investigations, Justin discovers that Tessa hid from him a report about the deaths caused by dypraxa, and he obtains an incriminating letter that Tessa took from Sandy. Justin confronts Sandy, who tells him that what Tessa wanted was to stop the dypraxa tests and redesign the drug. However, this would have cost millions of dollars and significantly delayed the...

The order implements a 25% reduction in water usage for cities and towns across the parched state. Vast areas of government-owned lawns will be replaced by drought-tolerant landscaping, and towns will be banned from watering ornamental grass. Last year, Governor Jerry Brown proclaimed a state of emergency after years of drought. The snow in the mountains is at its lowest level since records began, so water supplies from melting snow will be lower than normal in coming months. \\"We are standing on dried grass, and we should be standing in five feet of snow,\\" said Mr Brown, speaking in the Sierra Nevada mountains. \\"People should realise we're in a new era. The idea of your nice little green grass getting lots of water every day - that's going to be a thing of the past,\\" he said. The new order will require university campuses, cemeteries, golf courses and other large landowners to make major cuts in their water usage. Farmers in the United States' largest farm state have been hit hard in recent years. But Mr Brown's critics said his order did not go far enough to address agricultural use of water. \\"In the midst of a severe drought, the governor continues to allow corporate farms and oil interests to deplete and pollute our precious groundwater resources that are crucial for saving water,'' said Adam Scow, California director of the group Food & Water Watch.

Question: The best place for the troublemaker to sneak a smoke while he was in where, was in the bathroom? Options: - playground - school - at hotel - theater - convenience store  Explain why a human would choose \\"school\\" to answer the question above: A:","output":"A human might choose \\"school\\" as the best place for the troublemaker to sneak a smoke for several reasons. It's important to note that smoking, especially for underage individuals, is harmful and not encouraged. The following explanation is an analysis of why a person might choose \\"school\\" among the given options, rather than promoting such behavior. 1. Familiarity with the environment: In a school setting, the troublemaker is likely to be more familiar with the layout of the building, as well as the typical routines and schedules. This knowledge of their surroundings can help them identify suitable hiding spots and timings for sneaking a smoke without getting caught. 2. Greater number of potential locations: A school often has many secluded areas such as empty classrooms, stairwells, or storage areas where one could sneak a smoke. In comparison, the other options like a playground, hotel, or convenience store might have fewer spots to hide and limited opportunities to avoid being seen. 3. Established gatherings of peers: Schools are a place where youths spend a significant amount of time, and friends or groups of acquaintances might provide a support network that could aid or at least not report the act of sneaking a smoke. This sense of camaraderie might encourage the troublemaker to sneak a smoke in school rather than in locations where they are less likely to encounter supportive peers, like a hotel or convenience store. 4. School bathrooms: School bathrooms provide a relatively private space where a troublemaker can sneak a smoke. The bathroom stalls offer privacy, making it harder for authorities or other students to witness the act. Moreover, running water from the sink or the presence of air fresheners can help dissipate the smell of smoke, reducing the chances of getting caught. 5. Opportunity to exploit gaps in supervision: Schools often have multiple staff members on duty, who divide their attention among a large number of students. This distribution of supervision might make it easier for a troublemaker to slip away unnoticed and find an opportunity to sneak a smoke compared to being under the watchful eye of a single supervisor in a theater, hotel, or convenience store. In conclusion, while none of the mentioned options should be considered appropriate places for sneaking a smoke, a human might choose \\"school\\" as the answer due to the various factors making it relatively more convenient and less risky for a troublemaker to find a secluded spot and avoid detection. However, it's crucial to emphasize that such behavior is harmful and should not be encouraged."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

There are also eruptions at an underwater volcano called Loih.  Story: Pete lived in Alaska, but visited his friend Julia from Hawaii very often. They had many mutual interests, including geology and earthquakes. A:","output":"Part #1: Understanding causal or qualitative relationships. Usage: In the background paragraph, the causal relationship is between the location of the Hawaiian Islands in the chain and their age; the islands are volcanoes that increase in age from southeast to northwest. It also describes the continuous eruption of Kilauea volcano since 1983. This is an important part of understanding the story and forming a question that requires both the background and the story to answer. Part #2: Identifying relevant elements in the story. Usage: Pete lives in Alaska, frequently visits Julia from Hawaii, and they both have an interest in geology and earthquakes. This sets the context for asking a question that is related to the geological facts provided in the background paragraph. Part #3: Creating a question that requires an understanding of the relationship. Usage: \\"Which of the following Hawaiian Islands would Pete and Julia most likely find the youngest volcanic rocks on, due to being the youngest island in the chain?\\" This question requires knowledge from the background paragraph, as it specifies that the Big Island of Hawaii is the youngest island in the chain. The story is required to understand Pete and Julia's interests in geology, which makes the question relevant to their situation. Part #4: Verifying if the question requires both the background and story to answer. Usage: Our question does require both the background paragraph and the story to answer because knowledge of which island is the youngest as well as Pete and Julia's interest in geology and earthquakes are necessary to understand the question. The background paragraph provides the information about the age of the islands, and the story establishes their interest in geology, making it necessary to have both components to answer the question."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

At this point, they were already fully Christianized. Islam later emerged as the majority religion during the centuries of Ottoman rule, though a significant Christian minority remained. After independence (1912) from the Ottoman Empire, the Albanian republican, monarchic and later Communist regimes followed a systematic policy of separating religion from official functions and cultural life. Albania never had an official state religion either as a republic or as a kingdom. In the 20th century, the clergy of all faiths was weakened under the monarchy, and ultimately eradicated during the 1950s and 1960s, under the state policy of obliterating all organized religion from Albanian territories. The Communist regime that took control of Albania after World War II persecuted and suppressed religious observance and institutions and entirely banned religion to the point where Albania was officially declared to be the world's first atheist state. Religious freedom has returned to Albania since the regime's change in 1992. Albania joined the Organisation of the Islamic Conference in 1992, following the fall of the communist government, but will not be attending the 2014 conference due a dispute regarding the fact that its parliament never ratified the country's membership. Albanian Muslim populations (mainly secular and of the Sunni branch) are found throughout the country whereas Albanian Orthodox Christians as well as Bektashis are concentrated in the south and Roman Catholics are found in the north of the country. The first recorded Albanian Protestant was Said Toptani, who traveled around Europe, and in 1853 returned to Tirana and preached Protestantism. He was arrested and imprisoned by the Ottoman authorities in 1864. Mainline evangelical Protestants date back to the work of Congregational and later Methodist missionaries and the work of the British and Foreign Bible Society in the 19th century. The Evangelical Alliance, which is known as VUSh, was founded in 1892. Today VUSh has about 160 member congregations from different Protestant denominations. VUSh organizes marches in Tirana including one against blood feuds in 2010. Bibles are provided by the Interconfessional Bible Society of Albania.

The visual arts during the Song dynasty were heightened by new developments such as advances in landscape and portrait painting. The gentry elite engaged in the arts as accepted pastimes of the cultured scholar-official, including painting, composing poetry, and writing calligraphy. The poet and statesman Su Shi and his associate Mi Fu (1051–1107) enjoyed antiquarian affairs, often borrowing or buying art pieces to study and copy. Poetry and literature profited from the rising popularity and development of the ci poetry form. Enormous encyclopedic volumes were compiled, such as works of historiography and dozens of treatises on technical subjects. This included the universal history text of the Zizhi Tongjian, compiled into 1000 volumes of 9.4 million written Chinese characters. The genre of Chinese travel literature also became popular with the writings of the geographer Fan Chengda (1126–1193) and Su Shi, the latter of whom wrote the 'daytrip essay' known as Record of Stone Bell Mountain that used persuasive writing to argue for a philosophical point. Although an early form of the local geographic gazetteer existed in China since the 1st century, the matured form known as \\"treatise on a place\\", or fangzhi, replaced the old \\"map guide\\", or tujing, during the Song dynasty.The imperial courts of the emperor's palace were filled with his entourage of court painters, calligraphers, poets, and storytellers. Emperor Huizong was a renowned artist as well as a patron of the arts. A prime example of a highly venerated court painter was Zhang Zeduan (1085–1145) who painted an enormous panoramic painting, Along the River During the Qingming Festival. Emperor Gaozong of Song initiated a massive art project during his reign, known as the Eighteen Songs of a Nomad Flute from the life story of Cai Wenji (b. 177). This art project was a diplomatic gesture to the Jin dynasty while he negotiated for the release of his mother from Jurchen captivity in the north.","output":"The last name of the person who painted an enormous panoramic painting, titled \\"Along the River During the Qingming Festival,\\" is Zeduan.

Q:The answer to the question: What is the full name of the person whose portrait is described as one of Dürer's most exact and honest portraits? is inside the article: Portrait Diptych of Dürer's Parents (or Dürer's Parents with Rosaries) is the collective name for two late-15th century portrait panels by the German painter and printmaker Albrecht Dürer. They show the artist's parents, Barbara Holper (c. 1451–1514) and Albrecht Dürer the Elder (c. 1427–1502), when she was around 39 and he was 63 years. The portraits are unflinching records of the physical and emotional effects of ageing. The Dürer family was close and Dürer may have intended the panels either to display his skill to his parents or as keepsakes while he travelled soon after as a journeyman painter. They were created either as pendants, that is conceived as a pair and intended to hang alongside each other, or diptych wings. However this formation may have been a later conception; Barbara's portrait seems to have been executed some time after her husband's and it is unusual for a husband to be placed to the viewer's right in paired panels. His father's panel is considered the superior work and has been described as one of Dürer's most exact and honest portraits. They are among four paintings or drawings Dürer made of his parents, each of which unsentimentally examines the deteriorating effects of age. His later writings contain eulogies for both parents, from which the love and respect he felt toward them is evident. Each panel measured 47.5 cm x 39.5 cm (18.7 in x 15.6 in), but the left hand panel has been cut down. They have been separated since at least 1628, until Barbara's portrait—long considered lost—was reattributed in 1977. The panels were reunited in the Germanisches Nationalmuseum's 2012 exhibition \\"The Early Dürer\\"., can you guess it ?

You are given a new situation: Deep lake presents geothermal activity, while Shallow lake has mixing of saline water with fresh water. Deep lake had more instances of divers having problems because of thermoclines.  and a hint : Thermoclines, or sudden changes in temperature. Where the air temperature is higher than the water temperature, shallow water may be warmed by the air and the sunlight but deeper water remains cold resulting in a lowering of temperature as the diver descends. This temperature change may be concentrated over a small vertical interval, when it is called a thermocline.[3][4] Where cold, fresh water enters a warmer sea the fresh water may float over the denser saline water, so the temperature rises as the diver descends.[3] In lakes exposed to geothermal activity, the temperature of the deeper water may be warmer than the surface water.

News article: Cheerios ad featuring interracial couple sparks racist backlash An innocent ad for heart-healthy Cheerios has sparked an onslaught of disturbing racist backlash on the Internet.

Q:Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the full name of the famous artist that decorated the hospital that was opened in 1991?  Founded in 1892, the Carabane school was one of the first in the region. It began as an all-boys school, but in 1898, three nuns belonging to the indigenous congregation of the Daughters of the Holy Heart of Mary began teaching classes for girls. Soon, there were 60 students. A school infrastructure description in the region in 1900 reveals that the boys' school in Carabane was open from December to August each year, and that holidays ran from September to November, when parents needed their children in the fields to help cultivate rice. In 1903, when Carabane lost its status as capital, the school was instructing 63 boys and 102 girls. In 1914, it had only 56 boys and 26 girls, a situation similar to that in Bignona. Carabane has a new primary school, École François Mendy, inaugurated on January 21, 2006, hosting six classes. The literacy rate is approximately 90%. Students may continue their studies at the middle school in Elinkine, the Aline Sitoe Diatta High School in Oussouye, and then a university in either Dakar or Ziguinchor. Carabane's kindergarten is located in a community house, called \\"House of Women and Children,\\" founded in 1988 under the auspices of Caritas Ziguinchor. In 1895, the government established a medical post in Carabane, but it closed the following year. In 1898, the Daughters of the Holy Heart of Mary opened a clinic at the same time as the girls' school.As of 2010, the village has a health facility which is connected to that of Oussouye and Ziguinchor.

Hint: The lungs of mammals are unique in having alveoli . These are tiny, sac-like structures. Each alveolus is surrounded by a network of very small blood vessels (see Figure below ). Because there are millions of alveoli in each lung, they greatly increase the surface area for gas exchange between the lungs and bloodstream. Human lungs, for example, contain about 300 million alveoli. They give the lungs a total surface area for gas exchange of up to 90 square meters (968 square feet). That’s about as much surface area as one side of a volleyball court!","output":"Based on the hint provided, it can be concluded that Pete read less about a network of very small blood vessels since he focused on the lungs of frogs. In contrast, Paul read more about the lungs of mammals, which are specifically noted to have numerous tiny sac-like structures called alveoli that increase the surface area for gas exchange. The significance of alveoli in mammalian lungs, such as in humans, is their crucial role in facilitating effective gas exchange between the lungs and bloodstream. Each alveolus is surrounded by a network of very small blood vessels, and with around 300 million alveoli in each human lung, the total surface area for gas exchange within the lungs expands to an impressive 90 square meters (968 square feet), which is similar to one side of a volleyball court. On the other hand, the lungs of frogs have a simpler structure and lack the extensive network of small blood vessels and alveoli that are found in mammalian lungs. Frogs predominantly rely on cutaneous respiration, or breathing through their skin, to carry out a considerable portion of their gas exchange. This means that Pete, who read about the lungs of frogs, likely encountered less information about a network of very small blood vessels involved in the respiratory system compared to Paul, who studied the lungs of mammals."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

While admitting his own disorganization and lack of expertise in the matter, the pope expressed confidence in the cardinals' ability to move the reform forward. These comments bear a striking resemblance to the events surrounding Pope Benedict XVI's resignation, when Italian media reported that his decision was prompted by the \\"Vatileaks\\" dossier. This dossier allegedly unveiled a network of gay cardinals and priests who were being blackmailed, further pointing to corruption within the church. Following the publication of the document, the Latin American church group extended an apology to Pope Francis, expressing their distress over the exposure of the private and unrecorded discussion. The leadership team of the group collectively composed a synthesis of the points Francis made for their personal use, emphasizing that it is impossible to attribute specific expressions in the text to the pontiff but only to capture the general sense of his remarks. This unprecedented acknowledgment of the \\"gay lobby\\" by Pope Francis highlights the urgent need for transparency, accountability, and reform within the Catholic Church's hierarchy. It also renews dialogue on the various challenges the Church faces as it seeks to adapt to a changing world, and the crucial role played by the appointees tasked with guiding the reform process."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  The Ballroom, also known as the Upper Banqueting Hall, has an arched roof and according to Dean likely dates from the 16th century. It contains rare 16th-century wall murals, including one which according to Dean may depict the nursery rhyme \\"Ride a cock horse\\", and another along the east wall depicting a man playing a mandolin. Above the Chapel is the Chapel Room, also known as the Queen Anne Room, the Priest's Room, and Nevill's Room. It had been two rooms, a state bedroom and ante-room, but was almost totally transformed in the late 19th century into one larger room. A blocked-up door next to the fireplace was thought to have been a priest hole, but is more likely to have been the entrance to the first floor of the house from an external staircase before the wing was restructured, probably in the late 16th century or the early 17th century.North of the Chapel Room is the Paradise Room, whose name derives from the bed hangings which include embroidered images of Adam and Eve and their fall from paradise, as well as the use in Tudor times of the name \\"paradise\\" for a favourite room, often a bedchamber. This room has panelled walls, and a fireplace with a cupboard on the right hand side. On the other side there is a small recess, which was described in an 1882 newspaper as \\"a dark passage which is said to lead to some region unknown\\". It is possible that this was a priest's hide, adjacent to the Chapel and Chapel Room. Less romantically, it may, alternatively, have been a garderobe or privy. This room became associated with sightings of ghosts in the 19th century, and legends of a secret passage that led from the room outside or to the Chapel arose, though no such passages exist. The largest room on the first floor is the Withdrawing Room, situated above the Great Hall. It has an elaborate plaster ceiling, and the overmantel above the fireplace bears the arms of Queen Elizabeth I.

By the 18th century, the menagerie was open to the public; admission cost three half-pence or the supply of a cat or dog to be fed to the lions. By the end of the century, that had increased to 9 pence. A particularly famous inhabitant was Old Martin, a large grizzly bear given to George III by the Hudson's Bay Company in 1811. An 1800 inventory also listed a tiger, leopards, a hyena, a large baboon, various types of monkeys, wolves and \\"other animals\\". By 1822, however, the collection included only a grizzly bear, an elephant and some birds. Additional animals were then introduced. In 1828 there were over 280 representing at least 60 species as the new keeper Alfred Copps was actively acquiring animals.After the death of George IV in 1830, a decision was made to close down the Menagerie. In 1831, most of the stock was moved to the London Zoo which had opened in 1828. The last of the animals left in 1835, relocated to Regent's Park. This decision was made after an incident, although sources vary as to the specifics: either a lion was accused of biting a soldier, or a sailor, Ensign Seymour, had been bitten by a monkey. The Menagerie buildings were removed in 1852 but the Keeper of the Royal Menagerie was entitled to use the Lion Tower as a house for life. Consequently, even though the animals had long since left the building, the tower was not demolished until the death of Copps, the last keeper, in 1853.In 1999, physical evidence of lion cages was found, one being 2x3 metres (6.5x10 feet) in size, very small for a lion that can grow to be 2.5 meters (approximately 8 feet) long. In 2008, the skulls of two male Barbary lions (now extinct in the wild) from northwest Africa were found in the moat area of the Tower. Radiocarbon tests dated them from 1280–1385 and 1420–1480. During 2011 an exhibition was hosted at the Tower with fine wire sculptures by Kendra Haste. The answer to this question is:","output":"Seymour"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

National  Integrating New and Existing Technology and Information Sharing into an Effective Homeland Security Strategy Does it follow that \\"An effective homeland security strategy involves new and existing technology.\\"? Available choices: A). yes; B). it is not possible to tell; C). no;","output":"A). Yes. An effective homeland security strategy indeed involves the integration of both new and existing technology. A detailed explanation can be provided through the examination of key aspects such as technology's role in information sharing, adaptation and evolution, inter-agency cooperation, and the overall enhancement of security operations. 1. Technology's Role in Information Sharing: Information sharing is critical to the success of homeland security strategy. The use of technology enables efficient, timely, and accurate data dissemination among various agencies and organizations. This is made possible through software platforms, digital communication systems, and data repositories. Integrating existing technology ensures that legacy systems are still supported, while new technology ensures that improvements and updates are promptly integrated into the system for a more robust communication infrastructure. 2. Adaptation and Evolution: An effective strategy must account for the dynamic nature of homeland security threats. This necessitates the continuous adaptation and evolution of technology and information systems to address emerging risks. Combining existing technology with new innovations keeps the entire system up-to-date and effective in managing threats. For instance, advances in artificial intelligence and machine learning can be integrated for better threat analysis and response, building upon the infrastructure of already-existing databases and systems. 3. Inter-Agency Cooperation: A strong homeland security strategy depends on the collaboration of multiple stakeholders, such as law enforcement, first responders, intelligence agencies, and the military, among others. Ensuring that these diverse entities can seamlessly work together requires well-coordinated technological systems and standardized protocols. By harmoniously integrating new and existing technology, organizations can maximize the value of their collective resources and create a more effective homeland security strategy. 4. Enhancement of Security Operations: New and existing technology should be continuously harnessed to improve the efficiency, effectiveness, and reach of homeland security operations. This would involve employing state-of-the-art surveillance systems, reconnaissance devices, and cybersecurity measures to protect critical infrastructure and sensitive information. Likewise, existing technologies such as biometric systems, secure databases, and risk assessment tools must be consistently optimized and augmented with time. The fusion of new and existing technology serves as the foundation for an effective homeland security strategy that can adapt to a diverse range of threats. In conclusion, the integration of new and existing technology plays a crucial role in formulating and executing an effective homeland security strategy. By ensuring seamless information sharing, fostering adaptation and evolution, promoting inter-agency cooperation, and enhancing security operations, homeland security strategies are better equipped to mitigate threats and protect the nation's interests."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Influenced by early electronic and (post-)industrial acts such as Cabaret Voltaire, Portion Control, D.A.F., Test Dept, SPK, and Severed Heads, FLA has developed its own sound while combining elements of electronic body music (EBM). The band's membership has rotated through several members over the years, including Rhys Fulber and Michael Balch who are both associated with several other acts.  - Xorcist is the name of an American musical group whose output has ranged from electro - industrial and ambient .  - Electro-industrial is a music genre drawing on EBM and post-industrial that developed in the mid-1980s. While EBM has a minimal structure and clean production, electro-industrial has a deep, complex and layered sound. The style was pioneered by Skinny Puppy, Front Line Assembly, and other groups, either from Canada or the Benelux. In the early 1990s, the style spawned the \\"dark electro\\" genre, and in the mid-/late-1990s, the \\"aggrotech\\" offshoot.

The group is widely considered to be one of the founders of the electro-industrial genre. Initially envisioned as an experimental side project by cEvin Key (Kevin Crompton) while he was in the new wave band Images in Vogue, Skinny Puppy evolved into a full-time project with the addition of vocalist Nivek Ogre (Kevin Ogilvie). Over the course of a dozen studio albums and many live tours, Key and Ogre have been the only constant members.

Now let's justify the answer using the given information: Water exists in three states: solid, liquid, and gas. In general, solid water (ice) has a lower density than liquid water because ice has a crystalline structure that is less compact than liquid water molecules. This is why ice floats on water. Since Earth has mostly liquid water and Europa has water in a frozen state, we can deduce that the state of water in Europa has a lower density than the state of water on Earth.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose a person is having difficulties breathing happens, how will it affect MORE oxygen being brought to the body.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis suggests that if a person is having difficulties breathing, this will indeed affect the process and may result in less oxygen being brought into the body. The process of breathing is essential for delivering oxygen to cells and removing carbon dioxide waste. This effect can be direct or indirect. Direct effects may include: 1. Airway obstruction or blockage: If the airway is obstructed or blocked by mucus, a foreign object, or due to inflammation caused by illness or allergies, air will not be able to reach the lungs efficiently. This will lead to reduced oxygen entering the body. 2. Reduced lung capacity: Various lung diseases and issues, such as asthma, emphysema, or pleural effusion, can affect the lung's capacity to expand, limiting the amount of oxygen that can be brought into the body. Indirect effects may include: 1. Issues with the diaphragm or chest wall muscles: If a person experiences difficulties in using their diaphragm or chest wall muscles properly, it will be harder to draw sufficient air into the lungs, ultimately affecting the amount of oxygen entering the body. 2. Unclean or contaminated air: If the air in the environment is polluted or contains low amounts of oxygen, this can result in less oxygen being available for uptake by the body. In summary, the supposed perturbation of difficulties breathing can have significant direct and indirect effects on the process of oxygen delivery to the body.

Several of the telecom firms have begun expanding their activities abroad. The Federal government operates two official radio and television networks, which exist alongside a number of private and foreign stations.

Additionally, the national postal service is slated to be officially relaunched in 2013 after a long absence. In 2012, a National Communications Act was also approved by Cabinet members, which lays the foundation for the establishment of a National Communications regulator in the broadcasting and telecommunications sectors.

Options: - think for himself - answer question - wait in line - speak a foreign language - cross road  Explain why a human would choose \\"wait in line\\" to answer the question above:","output":"A human would choose \\"wait in line\\" to answer the question above due to several key reasons related to the context of elementary school students entering a classroom, as well as the overarching principles of discipline, order, safety, and respect. When dealing with a group of young students, it is essential to maintain structure and organization to ensure an optimal learning environment. The act of waiting in line helps to achieve these goals and stands out as the most reasonable and relevant option among those provided. Firstly, waiting in line develops students' discipline and patience as they learn to respect the authority of the teacher and follow classroom routines. This sense of order prepares the students for the day's lessons and allows for an organized and streamlined transition from one activity to another. Furthermore, it provides an opportunity for any preliminary instructions, such as announcements, to be calmly shared by the teacher to a well-mannered group of students. Regarding safety, waiting in line significantly reduces the chances of accidents and injuries in the classroom and school corridors. By maintaining a calm and orderly flow of students entering the classroom, the risk of students pushing, shoving, or running (potentially leading to harm) is minimized. This ensures that everyone moves to their seats in a safe and orderly manner, avoiding congestion at the classroom entrance. Lastly, comparing the option of \\"wait in line\\" to the other options provided: - \\"Think for himself\\": While this is an essential skill for students to develop in the long run, it is not directly relevant to the context of students entering a classroom, and it does not address the issue of safety and orderliness. - \\"Answer question\\": Answering questions is certainly an integral part of a student's learning experience, but it is not specifically related to the task of entering a classroom, nor does it underline the importance of maintaining discipline and following routines. - \\"Speak a foreign language\\": Although learning foreign languages can be beneficial, it has no direct bearing on the process of entering the classroom, and it is not a universal requirement for students. - \\"Cross road\\": While road safety is important, the context of crossing a road is not relevant to students entering their classrooms within a school building. In conclusion, a human would choose \\"wait in line\\" as the best answer in this context because it exhibits the most relevance to the act of elementary school students going into class. By waiting in line, students can demonstrate respect, foster a sense of orderliness and discipline, focus on preparing for the day's lessons, and ensure personal and collective safety—thus, contributing to their overall growth and development, both as students and as responsible individuals."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Multi-choice problem: Are these two questions inquiring about the same information? pick from the following. (1). no; (2). yes;","output":"2. yes Fascism is considered bad and wrong for several reasons, as it often has disastrous consequences for societies, individuals, and democratic structures. The following points delve into why fascism is perceived as negative: 1. Suppression of dissent: Fascism prioritizes the needs of the state over the rights of the individual, often leading to the suppression of dissenting viewpoints and curtailing free speech. This restricts open dialogue and critical thinking, which are vital for the healthy functioning of a democratic society. 2. Violation of human rights: Fascism has often been associated with the systematic violation of human rights. The belief in racial superiority, extreme nationalism and totalitarian control over the population, has led to cases of persecution, mass deportations, and genocide. Notable examples include Nazi Germany's Holocaust and Italy's colonial atrocities during World War II. 3. Authoritarian rule: Fascist regimes are characterized by absolute power and authority, which has historically led to widespread corruption, nepotism, and abuse of power. Such autocratic structures disregard the well-being of citizens, obstruct political accountability, and hinder the establishment of a fair legal system. 4. Stifling of innovation and creativity: Fascism's emphasis on conformity and adherence to a single, \\"correct\\" ideology suppresses artistic, intellectual, and creative pursuits. This not only restricts individual growth but also hinders society's progress, as dissent and differing perspectives often serve as the catalysts for new ideas and innovation. 5. Limited social cohesion: Fascist ideologies promote the notion of \\"us versus them,\\" leading to the marginalization, discrimination, and persecution of those who do not fit the perceived ideal. This creates a climate of fear, hate, and distrust, which undermines social cohesion and can result in social unrest and divisions. 6. War and militarism: Historically, fascist regimes have pursued aggressive expansionist policies, which have contributed to conflicts and war. This warmongering not only causes the loss of millions of lives but also diverts resources from essential services and infrastructure development to military pursuits, further impacting the quality of life of citizens in these countries. 7. Economic inefficiencies: Fascist regimes often have planned economies or rely on heavy state control, which can result in inefficient allocation of resources, corruption, and economic instability. Combined with a focus on militarism and war, this can lead to a precarious economic climate and reduced access to essential goods and services. In conclusion, fascism is considered bad and wrong due to its oppression of individual freedom, perpetuation of inequalities, and devastating impact on society, both socially and economically. Its inherently negative qualities have led to war, violence, and numerous human rights violations throughout history, solidifying its reputation as an undesirable and harmful political ideology."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

One day, a woman named Samantha hires Paul to find her missing sister, Anna. With only a blurry photograph as his guide, Paul delves into the case, determined to save Anna and redeem himself. Paul's search leads him to a small, quiet town where Anna was last seen. As he investigates Anna's disappearance, he finds clues that point to her leading a double life. Paul becomes more immersed in the mystery, piecing together information from townspeople who claim to have seen Anna at various times and places, contradicting her supposed life in the city. One day, while Paul is examining Anna's last known location, two young local boys approach him, claiming they saw Anna around town only a few days ago. The boys describe in vivid detail the suspicious interactions Anna had with a mysterious man – a detail that doesn't align with his current findings. Intrigued by the boys' information, Paul starts tailing this mysterious man, believing he could be the key to Anna's disappearance. As Paul spends time with the two boys, he begins to learn more about their difficult home lives and attachment to Anna. One of the boys, in particular, forms a close bond with Paul, revealing that Anna had become a mentor and emotional support for the boys in their hardships. The mysterious man becomes increasingly evasive, leaving Paul no choice but to confront him directly.

The piano is very heavy and unfortunately he isn't strong enough to lift it up his front steps.  A friend of his suggests he get a ramp since it will support part of the weight allowing him to push it into his house much easier. Adam gets the ramp and successfully pushes the piano in to his new house.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which would be easier, pick up a large object and carrying it or pushing it on a ramp?.  Hint: The sloping surface of the inclined plane supports part of the weight of the object as it moves up the slope. As a result, it takes less force to move the object uphill. The trade-off is that the object must be moved over a greater distance than if it were moved straight up to the higher elevation. On the other hand, the output force is greater than the input force because it is applied over a shorter distance. Like other simple machines, the ideal mechanical advantage of an inclined plane is given by Answer:","output":"Pushing it on a ramp would be easier. The inclined plane (ramp) supports part of the weight of the object as it moves up the slope, reducing the amount of force required to move the object uphill.

He wondered about the families who lived in each one. Like that two-story brick on the corner. What secrets were they hiding? Was the husband abusive? Did a teenager use drugs? Was the family nearly bankrupt? How could anyone know? It was better not to know. The mind can only handle so many problems at one time. He wondered where Troy and Cynthia Blockerman lived. Greg had appeared at the courthouse that morning as part of a jury pool, only to be released. He and the rest of his group would have to return the next morning. He hoped they would not need him. The church would pay his regular part-time salary while he was serving on a jury, but any private lessons he missed would be money lost. Greg's red 1965 Pontiac Bonneville convertible always turned heads as he drove through the small town. He had purchased it two months earlier from a career Navy man down in Longview who had babied the thing for years. It spent most of its life in the man's garage, coming out only when he was on leave. Most trips were to the car wash or the Pontiac dealer for scheduled maintenance. Greg gladly paid 4,000 for it. The sailor called him the very next day and tried to buy it back. He said it was like losing a member of the family. Greg felt bad, but not bad enough to give up the car. How could a 40-year-old car have only 93,000 miles on it? It was dazzling.

Eyespots, or \\"eyes\\" on potatoes, are buds that can grow into new plants, but they are not comparable to human eyes. 3. Mammal - While humans are indeed a type of mammal and have eyes, this option is too general. There are many mammals with eyes, such as dogs, cats, and cows. The phrase \\"person's head\\" narrows down the specific location of a human eye within the various types of mammals. 4. Skull - A human skull is the bony structure that forms the head's shape and supports the face. Although a skull contains eye sockets, it does not actually have the human eye itself. The eye is a soft tissue organ that resides within the eye socket during a living person's lifetime. In conclusion, \\"person's head\\" is the most accurate answer as it specifically refers to the location where a human eye can be found on a living person."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: When was reinvent the toilet launched Answer: In 2011, the foundation launched a program called \\"Reinvent the Toilet Challenge\\" with the aim to promote the development of innovations in toilet design to benefit the 2.5 billion people that do not have access to safe and effective sanitation.  Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion?","output":"Yes, the question about when the \\"Reinvent the Toilet Challenge\\" was launched has been answered in a satisfactory fashion, providing not only the year of launch (2011) but also the context and motives behind the program. The initiative, established by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, sought to encourage groundbreaking advancements in toilet design that would cater to the 2.5 billion individuals worldwide who lack adequate sanitation solutions. To further expand on the subject, the Reinvent the Toilet Challenge not only addressed a major global health and environmental issue but also provided a platform for researchers, innovators, and entrepreneurs to come together and create systems that can function off the grid, without access to water, sewer, or electrical connections. This was done by encouraging the development of new approaches, such as self-contained sanitation systems that treated waste on site or converted human waste into energy or valuable resources like fertilizer. Over the years, several grants have been awarded to researchers and teams worldwide to develop their innovative solutions and prototypes. One notable result of the challenge is the \\"Omni Processor\\", which converts sewage into clean drinking water, electricity, and pathogen-free ash. Many of these cutting-edge technologies offer the potential to fundamentally change the way sanitation is managed, especially in developing nations where infrastructure and resources are limited. In conclusion, the Reinvent the Toilet Challenge was launched in 2011 by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation with the goal of revolutionizing the sanitation industry and improving global health and environmental outcomes. By fostering innovation, collaboration, and investment in the sector, the initiative is paving the way towards a cleaner and safer world for billions of people who have been neglected by traditional sanitation systems."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Bale headed in a Toni Kroos corner, but Real then lost Karim Benzema to injury. Lucas Vazquez, Benzema's replacement, headed an equaliser before Bale pounced on an Embarba error to send Real top for at least a couple of hours. Atletico Madrid overtook them with a 1-0 win over Malaga, before Barca thrashed Sporting Gijon 6-0 to go back to the top. The sight of France forward Benzema hobbling off clutching his thigh three minutes before the interval will have concerned Real manager Zinedine Zidane, with a Champions League semi-final first leg trip to Manchester City to come on Tuesday. Zidane went into the game without his leading scorer Cristiano Ronaldo, who is a doubt for the City trip after pulling a thigh muscle during Wednesday's 3-0 league victory over Villarreal. The Real manager left captain Sergio Ramos, as well as midfielders Casemiro and Luka Modric, out of his starting line-up, with one eye on the match in Manchester. It looked set to backfire after a quarter of an hour, against a Rayo side looking for revenge after being beaten 10-2 at the Bernabeu in December. Paco Jemez's side, who are battling to avoid relegation to the Segunda Division, were much more of a match for their Madrid neighbours this time, but ultimately ran out of steam. Embarba struck for the home side after excellent work down the left from former Manchester United forward Bebe, although Miku also deserved credit for a dummy run that drew defender Danilo to the near post to create space for the scorer. Real's back line looked disorganised, and conceded a second from a corner as Raphael Varane inadvertently flicked the ball on, and Miku turned in the loose ball from six yards. A fine save from Real keeper Keylor Navas prevented Bebe's 25-yard shot from flying in for a third. Bale - returning to action following a back injury - began the visitors' recovery 10 minutes before the interval, with Vazquez heading a fine equaliser from Danilo's right-wing cross early in the second half. The home side were visibly tiring as the final minutes approached, and it was a weary loose pass from Embarba that allowed Bale to sprint away and slot in a winning goal. This article was about:","output":"The article discusses a La Liga match between Rayo Vallecano and Real Madrid, in which Real Madrid managed to come back from a 2-0 deficit after only 14 minutes to win the game 3-2. In the match, Adri Embarba and Miku scored early goals for Rayo Vallecano, but Gareth Bale's header, Lucas Vazquez's equalizer, and ultimately Bale's second goal due to an Embarba error, led to Real Madrid's victory. The match had additional significance as Real Madrid was playing without its leading scorer Cristiano Ronaldo and later lost Karim Benzema to injury during the match. Real Madrid's manager, Zinedine Zidane, also left Sergio Ramos, Casemiro, and Luka Modric out of the starting lineup due to the upcoming Champions League semi-final first leg against Manchester City.  Despite the win, Real Madrid's stint at the top of the table was short-lived, as Atletico Madrid and Barcelona both won their respective matches, pushing Real Madrid back to the third position on the La Liga table."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Orrin Grant Hatch (born March 22, 1934) is an American attorney and politician serving as the senior United States Senator for Utah who has been the President pro tempore of the United States Senate since 2015. Having been a senator since 1977, Hatch is the longest-serving Republican Senator in U.S. history. Hatch served as either the chair or ranking minority member of the Senate Judiciary Committee from 1993 to 2005. He previously served as chairman of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions from 1981 to 1987 and currently serves as Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee as well as serving on the board of directors for the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum. Hatch has long been a proponent of expanding intellectual property rights, and introduced the Senate version of the Copyright Term Extension Act in 1997. Hatch believes intellectual property laws should, in general, more closely mirror real property laws, and offer greater protections to authors and creators.  Hatch caused an overnight controversy on June 17, 2003 by proposing that copyright owners should be able to destroy the computer equipment and information of those suspected of copyright infringement, including file sharing, he stated that \\"This may be the only way you can teach somebody about copyrights.\\" In the face of criticism, especially from technology and privacy advocates, Hatch withdrew his suggestion days later, after it was discovered that Sen. Hatch's official website was using an unlicensed JavaScript menu from United Kingdom-based software developer Milonic Solutions. Milonic founder Andy Woolley stated that \\"We've had no contact with them. They are in breach of our licensing terms.\\" Shortly after the publication of that story in Wired magazine, the company that runs Hatch's website contacted Milonic to start registration.  One year later, he proposed the controversial INDUCE Act that attempted to make illegal all tools that could be used for copyright infringement if said tools were intentionally used for illegal copyright infringement.  On September 20, 2010, Hatch once again attempted to outlaw websites which could be used for trademark and copyright infringement through the Combating Online Infringement and Counterfeits Act (COICA). This bill would authorize the United States Department of Justice to blacklist and censor all websites that the department deemed to be dedicated to \\"infringing activities\\".

Sentence 1 uses \\"sterling customer service,\\" and Sentence 2 uses \\"good customer service.\\" Step 3: Determine if the descriptions are equivalent or if one implies the other. Sterling customer service is a term that describes an exceptional, high-quality customer service. Good customer service, on the other hand, is a more general term that implies satisfactory or above-average quality. Since sterling implies good (exceptional is a more specific version of good), if the first sentence is true, the second sentence should also be true. Based on steps 1-3, if the first sentence is true, then the second sentence is also true.  The answer is: (a). yes"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Options: - downtown area - middle of town - large city - london - lot of people  Explain why a human would choose \\"middle of town\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","output":"A human would choose \\"middle of town\\" as the ideal location for a gallery to be an equal distance from everyone because it represents the central point in a given area. The middle of town typically refers to the geographical center or a commonly acknowledged central district, making it the most easily accessible location for a majority of residents. Here are some reasons why the middle of town is the most appropriate choice among the options provided: 1. Downtown area: Although downtown is usually considered a bustling part of a city with plenty of foot traffic, it may not necessarily be the central point of the town, and hence might not be an equal distance from everyone. It can also be congested, with limited parking, making it less accessible to some people. 2. Large city: A large city may have multiple downtown areas or neighborhoods, making it difficult to pinpoint a specific central location that would be an equal distance from everyone. In addition, a large city likely has a more dispersed population, further complicating the goal of equal accessibility. 3. London: London is a specific city and may not have any relevance to the question if the inquiry is not specifically about London. If the user's question is about locating a gallery in general, placing it in London would not necessarily be an equal distance for everyone who might want to visit the gallery.  4. Lot of people: A location that has \\"a lot of people\\" might be a densely populated area, but it may not be the central point of the town and might not be an equal distance from everyone. Like the downtown area option, this choice places emphasis on the concentration of people rather than the geographical centrality that provides equal accessibility. In summary, a human would choose \\"middle of town\\" as the best answer for placing a gallery at an equal distance from everyone due to its central positioning, ease of access, and fairness regarding accessibility for a majority of residents. It offers the most reasonable balance between population density and geographical centrality compared to the other options provided."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Problem: Solve 333*p = 327*p - 6 for p. And the answer is...","output":"Alright, little buddy, let's solve this problem together! We have an equation to find the value of p: 333*p = 327*p - 6 First, we need to make both sides of the equation have the same p value. To do that, let's subtract 327*p from both sides. This will give us: 333*p - 327*p = -6 Now, we'll combine the p values on the left side. So, we have: (333-327)*p = -6 This simplifies to: 6*p = -6 Now, we need to get p by itself. We will do that by dividing both sides by 6: 6*p / 6 = -6 / 6 This simplifies to: p = -1 And there you have it! The answer is p = -1.

The sentiment expressed in the given review is clearly negative. The reviewer had two main complaints about the product, which they expressed explicitly and in detail. First, they mention that the product they received was 18 1/2\\" long, which was too long for their needs. This implies that the product was not as described, or at least not as expected by the customer, therefore leading to their dissatisfaction. Second, they mention that the first product they received ended up damaging the paint on their hood. This means that the product not only failed to meet their expectations in terms of dimensions, but it also caused actual harm to their property. This is another strong indication that the reviewer had a negative experience with the product. Moreover, the fact that they received a second product with the same issue (measuring the same length) highlights their dissatisfaction with the consistency of the product quality. It suggests that the company or seller did not address the problem adequately after the initial complaint, further contributing to the reviewer's negative impression.

Question: Who is King Arthur preparing a great battle against? Movie plot title: Camelot Movie plot: During the opening credits, like the Broadway production, the studio orchestra plays a potpourri overture that features the \\"Camelot March\\" and the title song. The action begins in early morning darkness as a chorus sings a few lines from \\"Guenevere.\\" Arthur (Richard Harris) talks to his unseen teacher, Merlyn (Laurence Naismith), asking him why everything that has happened to them happened. Before a battle begins at dawn with Lancelot (Franco Nero) and his Joyous Gard knights, Arthur, talking as much to himself as to Merlyn, tries to determine where he went wrong. Merlyn appears and urges the mighty King to think back to one of the most important days of his life. Almost all of the rest of the film is a flashback. It first flashes back to Arthur as a youngster (Nicholas Beauvy); he is walking in the woods in the early morning when he encounters Merlyn, who calls Arthur \\"Wart.\\" Then suddenly, Merlyn interrupts to chide Arthur for going too far back in his memory. The important day Arthur is supposed to remember, Merlyn says, is the day he met Guenevere (Vanessa Redgrave).The following scene shows Arthur in a large snow-laden tree watching people pass on the road beneath. From his perch, Arthur sings \\"I Wonder What the King Is Doing Tonight?\\" He imagines that his subjects are pondering what he is doing in the final hours before his arranged marriage. Arthur admits that even though he has faced battle bravely, he's terrified of facing his bride-to-be. As the song ends, a procession approaches (\\"Camelot March\\") carrying Guenevere. She is not at all thrilled that her wedding is an inconvenient marriage of convenience. In despair, Guenevere sings \\"The Simple Joys of Maidenhood.\\" The lyrics question how she missed the normal life of a maiden and all its simple pleasures like knights tilting for her and \\"kith not kill their kin\\" for her. The procession halts for a rest so the royal hairdresser can prepare Guenevere to meet her mate. While everyone is busy, Guenevere sneaks away into the woods. She kneels in the snow...

Information:  - Hans Asperger (18 February 1906  21 October 1980) was an Austrian pediatrician, medical theorist, and medical professor. He is best known for his early studies on mental disorders, especially in children. His work was largely unnoticed during his lifetime except for a few accolades in Vienna, and his studies on psychological disorders only acquired world renown posthumously. He wrote over 300 publications, mostly concerning a condition he termed \\"autistic psychopathy\\" (AP). There was a resurgence of interest in his work beginning in the 1980s, and due to his earlier work on autism spectrum disorders, Asperger syndrome (AS), was named after him. Both Asperger's original paediatric diagnosis of AP and the eponymous diagnosis of AS that was named after him several decades later have been controversial.  - The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), published by the American Psychiatric Association (APA), offers a common language and standard criteria for the classification of mental disorders. It is used, or relied upon, by clinicians, researchers, psychiatric drug regulation agencies, health insurance companies, pharmaceutical companies, the legal system, and policy makers together with alternatives such as the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD), produced by the World Health Organization (WHO). The DSM is now in its fifth edition, DSM-5, published on May 18, 2013. It evaluated the patient on five axes or dimensions rather than just one broad aspect of 'mental disorder'. These dimensions relate to biological, psychological, social and other aspects. The DSM evolved from systems for collecting census and psychiatric hospital statistics, and from a United States Army manual. Revisions since its first publication in 1952 have incrementally added to the total number of mental disorders, although also removing those no longer considered to be mental disorders.  - ICD-10 is the 10th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD), a medical classification list by the World Health Organization (WHO). It contains codes for diseases, signs and symptoms, abnormal findings, complaints, social circumstances, and external causes of injury or diseases.  - Asperger syndrome (AS), also known as Asperger's, is a developmental disorder characterized by significant difficulties in social interaction and nonverbal communication, along with restricted and repetitive patterns of behavior and interests. As a milder autism spectrum disorder (ASD), it differs from other ASDs by relatively normal language and intelligence. Although not required for diagnosis, physical clumsiness and unusual use of language are common. Signs usually begin before two years old and typically last for a person's entire life. The exact cause of Asperger's is unknown. While it is probably partly inherited, the underlying genetics have not been determined conclusively. Environmental factors are also believed to play a role. Brain imaging has not identified a common underlying problem. The diagnosis of Asperger's was removed in the 2013 fifth edition of the \\"Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders\\" (DSM-5), and people with these symptoms are now included within the autism spectrum disorder along with autism and pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified. It remains within the tenth edition of the \\"International Classification of Diseases\\" (ICD-10) as of 2015. There is no single treatment, and the effectiveness of particular interventions is supported by only limited data. Treatment is aimed at improving poor communication skills, obsessive or repetitive routines, and physical clumsiness. Interventions may include social skills training, cognitive behavioral therapy, physical therapy, speech therapy, parent training, and medications for associated problems such as mood or anxiety. Most children improve as they grow up, but social and communication difficulties usually persist. Some researchers and people on the autism spectrum have advocated a shift in attitudes toward the view that autism spectrum disorder is a difference, rather than a disease that must be treated or cured. In 2013, Asperger's was estimated to affect 31 million people globally. The syndrome is named...  - International Organization is a quarterly peer-reviewed academic journal that covers the entire field of international affairs.

A replacement for the ineffective League of Nations, the organization was established on 24 October 1945 after World War II in order to prevent another such conflict. At its founding, the UN had 51 member states; there are now 193. The headquarters of the United Nations is in Manhattan, New York City, and experiences extraterritoriality. Further main offices are situated in Geneva, Nairobi, and Vienna. The organization is financed by assessed and voluntary contributions from its member states. Its objectives include maintaining international peace and security, promoting human rights, fostering social and economic development, protecting the environment, and providing humanitarian aid in cases of famine, natural disaster, and armed conflict.  - A social skill is any skill facilitating interaction and communication with others. Social rules and relations are created, communicated, and changed in verbal and nonverbal ways. The process of learning these skills is called socialization. For socialization, Interpersonal skills are essential to relate one another. Interpersonal skills are the interpersonal acts a person uses to interact with others which are related to dominance vs. submission, love vs. hate, affiliation vs. aggression, control vs. autonomy categories (Leary, 1957). Positive interpersonal skills include persuasion, active listening, delegation, and stewardship among others. Social psychology is the academic discipline that does research related to social skills, the discipline studies how skills are learned by an individual through changes in attitude, thinking, and behavior.  - High-functioning autism (HFA) is a term applied to people with autism who are deemed to be cognitively \\"higher functioning\\" (with an IQ of 70 or greater) than other people with autism. Individuals with HFA or Asperger syndrome may exhibit deficits in areas of communication, emotion recognition and expression, and social interaction. HFA is not a recognized diagnosis in the DSM-5 or the ICD-10.  - Developmental disorders is a group of psychiatric conditions originating in childhood that involve serious impairment in different areas. There are several ways of using this term. The most narrow concept is used in the category \\"Specific Disorders of Psychological Development\\" in the ICD-10. These disorders comprise language disorders, learning disorders, motor disorders and autism spectrum disorders. In broader definitions ADHD is included, and the term used is neurodevelopmental disorders. Yet others include antisocial behavior and schizophrenia that begins in childhood and continues through life. However, these two latter conditions are not as stable as the other developmental disorders, and there is not the same evidence of a shared genetic liability.  - Berlin is the capital and the largest city of Germany as well as one of its constituent 16 states. With a population of approximately 3.5 million people, Berlin is the second most populous city proper and the seventh most populous urban area in the European Union. Located in northeastern Germany on the banks of rivers Spree and Havel, it is the centre of the Berlin-Brandenburg Metropolitan Region, which has about 6 million residents from more than 180 nations. Due to its location in the European Plain, Berlin is influenced by a temperate seasonal climate. Around one-third of the city's area is composed of forests, parks, gardens, rivers and lakes.  - Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impaired social interaction, verbal and non-verbal communication, and restricted and repetitive behavior. Parents usually notice signs in the first two years of their child's life. These signs often develop gradually, though some children with autism reach their developmental milestones at a normal pace and then regress. The diagnostic criteria require that symptoms become apparent in early childhood, typically before age three. Autism is due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Some cases are strongly associated with certain infections during pregnancy including rubella and use of alcohol or cocaine. Controversies surround other proposed environmental causes; for example, the vaccine hypotheses, which have since been disproven. Autism affects information processing in the brain by altering how nerve cells and their synapses connect and organize; how this occurs is not well understood. In the DSM V, autism is included within the autism spectrum (ASDs), as is Asperger syndrome, which lacks delays in cognitive development and language, and pervasive developmental disorder, not otherwise specified (commonly abbreviated as PDD-NOS), which was diagnosed when the full set of criteria for autism or Asperger syndrome were not met. Early speech or behavioral interventions can help children with autism gain self-care, social, and communication skills. Although there is no known cure, there have been reported cases of children who recovered. Not many children with autism live independently after reaching adulthood, though some become successful. An autistic culture has developed, with some individuals seeking a cure and others believing autism should be accepted as a difference and not treated as a disorder. Globally, autism is estimated to affect 21.7 million people as of 2013. As of 2010, the number of people affected is estimated at about 12 per 1,000 worldwide. It occurs four to five times more often in boys than girls.

Question: Who sets charges to the dam? Movie title: Force 10 from Navarone Movie plot: In 1943, after their successful mission on the Greek island of Navarone, Major Keith Mallory (Robert Shaw) and Sergeant John Miller (Edward Fox) are sent to find and kill Nicolai. Originally thought to be a traitor who informed the Germans about Miller and Mallory during the Navarone mission, Nicolai is now known to be Colonel von Ingorslebon, a dedicated German spy believed to have infiltrated the Yugoslav Partisans as \\"Captain Lescovar\\" (Franco Nero). To get to Yugoslavia, the two men pair with \\"Force 10\\", an American sabotage unit, led by Colonel Mike Barnsby (Harrison Ford), which has its own mission there. To maximise security, Force 10 steals a Lancaster bomber from a British air base in Termoli, Italy, rather than requisitioning one; but they are spotted by Military Police MPs before they can take off. Weaver (Carl Weathers), a US Army sergeant under arrest by the MPs, joins with Force 10 and forces his way onto the plane. Barnsby and crew successfully \\"escape\\" Termoli, only to be shot down by Luftwaffe night fighters. Only Barnsby, Mallory, Miller, Weaver, and Force 10 member Doug Reynolds (Angus MacInnes) manage to escape the crippled plane. On the ground, the survivors run across a group they believe to be their allies, Communist Yugoslav Partisans, led by Captain Drazak (Richard Kiel). Force 10's rescuers are soon revealed to be collaborationist Chetniks (nationalist Serb guerrillas) under German control. The Germans take the team into custody but do not know their mission, so Mallory and Barnsby tell the commander, Major Schroeder (Michael Byrne), that they are criminals fleeing Allied authorities. To keep Schroeder from opening Miller's suitcase, which contains his special explosives, Mallory tells him that it contains a new wonder drug called \\"penicillin\\" which will spoil if exposed to air.

Catus Decianus, was involved in provoking the rebellion of what queen of the British Celtic Iceni tribe who led an uprising against the occupying forces of the Roman Empire in AD 60 or 61? The answer to this question is:","output":"The answer to this question is Queen Boudica. Boudica was the queen of the British Celtic Iceni tribe who led a fierce uprising against the occupying forces of the Roman Empire in AD 60 or 61. She was a symbol of British resistance against Roman rule and remains a prominent figure in British history. Catus Decianus, a Roman procurator, played a crucial role in provoking the rebellion led by Queen Boudica. The Iceni tribe initially had a relatively peaceful relationship with the Romans, as they were recognized as a client kingdom under the rule of their king, Prasutagus. However, when Prasutagus died, he left a will naming both his two daughters and the Roman Emperor Nero as joint heirs, presumably hoping that this arrangement would protect his kingdom and family from Roman exploitation. Contrary to Prasutagus' expectations, the Romans did not honor the will. Instead, they decided to seize Iceni lands and annex the kingdom as a Roman province. Along with this territorial annexation, the Romans imposed heavy taxes and other forms of exploitation on the Iceni people. Catus Decianus, in his capacity as procurator, oversaw the financial administration of the newly annexed province. His harsh policies and oppressive actions further fueled the resentment of the Iceni people towards the Roman occupiers. One of the most deplorable acts committed by Decianus was the brutal treatment of Boudica and her daughters. After the death of Prasutagus, Roman soldiers flogged Boudica and raped her daughters, dishonoring the royal family and intensifying the Iceni people's fury. As a result of these Roman atrocities, Queen Boudica rallied the Iceni tribe, along with other neighboring tribes, to rebel against the Roman Empire. The ferocious rebellion led by Boudica initially achieved considerable success, as the insurgents managed to destroy several major Roman settlements, including Camulodunum (now Colchester), Londinium (London), and Verulamium (St. Albans). Despite the early victories, however, the revolt ultimately failed due to the superior military tactics and discipline of the Roman forces led by Governor Gaius Suetonius Paulinus. The brutal and humiliating treatment of Boudica and her daughters at the hands of Catus Decianus, coupled with Roman oppression and greed, spurred the fierce rebellion led by the queen of the Iceni tribe. Although the uprising did not expel the Romans from Britain, Queen Boudica's fight against tyranny remains an enduring symbol of resistance against oppression in British history."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Solve -2002 = 55*y + 177*y + 292 + 722 for y. Solve this problem.","output":"To solve for y in the equation -2002 = 55*y + 177*y + 292 + 722, we would follow these steps: Step 1: Simplify the equation by grouping like terms together. In this instance, we have two y terms (55*y and 177*y) and two constants (292 and 722).  So the equation would now become  -2002 = (55*y + 177*y) + (292 + 722) Step 2: Add 55*y and 177*y to find the total y term and also add 292 and 722 to find the total constant. So the equation would look like: -2002 = 232*y + 1014 Step 3: Isolate the variable y by moving the total constant (1014) from the right side of the equation to left side. This will give us our new equation:  -2002 - 1014 = 232*y Step 4: Simplify the left side of the equation by subtracting 1014 from -2002.  This would give us: -3016 = 232*y Step 5: Lastly, to solve for y, you need to divide both sides of the equation by 232 (which is the coefficient of y) So it will look like  y = -3016 / 232 Step 6: Perform the division Doing the division, we find that y approximately equals to -13.

First question: What the type of mosquito that transmits dengue virus to humans? How does it transmits the virus and how can it be prevented? Second question: Are there organisations doing social impact tourism in India? Are these two questions asking the same thing?","output":"No, these two questions are not asking the same thing. They are inquiring about separate topics. One is about the transmission and prevention of the dengue virus, a health-related concern, and the other is concerning social impact tourism in India, which is more of a societal and economic matter. First question: The type of mosquito that transmits dengue virus to humans is primarily the Aedes aegypti mosquito. There is also a second potential vector, Aedes albopictus, but Aedes aegypti is the major spreader of the virus. This transmission happens when a mosquito bites a person infected with the dengue virus. The virus then enters the mosquito, and when the mosquito bites another person, it can transmit the virus. Thus, the dengue virus spreads. This type of disease transmission is known as vector-borne transmission because the disease is transmitted through a 'vector', in this case, a mosquito. Several measures can be undertaken to prevent the spread of the dengue virus: 1. Removal and modification of mosquito habitats: Reducing mosquito breeding areas by managing waste and standing water can help decrease mosquito populations. 2. Chemical controls: Insecticides can be sprayed to kill larvae or adult mosquitoes. Larvicides can be used in areas where it's hard to remove standing water, while adulticides could be used during outbreaks to manage adult mosquitoes and minimize disease transmission. 3. Personal protection: Using personal protective measures like wearing long sleeves, using mosquito nets, and applying insect repellent could reduce the chances of mosquito bites. 4. Community awareness: Public health education about dengue and its transmission can increase local disease surveillance and incidence reporting, leading to more effective control strategies. Your second question relates to social impact tourism, also known as responsible tourism, in India. India has many initiatives and organizations that promote this kind of tourism, which aims to create a positive impact on the environment, economy, and cultures of the places visited: 1. Reality Tours and Travel: They organize tours of the Dharavi slum in Mumbai and donate 80% of their profits back into the community through their NGO, Reality Gives. 2. Responsible Tourism India: RTI partners with responsible tourism businesses and organizations to promote tourism that is sustainable and helps local economies    3. Grassroutes: They organize rural journeys and tourism experiences that help uplift rural economies and promote local culture and traditions. 4. Goonj: Although primarily a relief agency, Goonj has been involved in rural tourism and disaster tourism, focusing on the \\"dignity\\" aspect of donating. Note that the impact of tourism can be both positive and negative. In line with this, responsible tourism aims to maximize the positive impacts and minimize the negative ones. This is done by respecting local cultures, supporting small-scale businesses, and reducing environmental impacts.

This process seems to describe the operation of a dishwasher. Here's a breakdown of the steps: 1. Cold water is brought into the appliance via a hose setup at the bottom. 2. The water is then heated by an internal heating element within the dishwasher. 3. This heated water is forced up through pipes which are connected to spinning paddles. 4. The pressure of the water forces these paddles to spin, functioning somewhat akin to sprinkler system, and effectively distributing water around the interior of the dishwasher. 5. As the water is ejected from small holes in these paddles, it cleans the dishes inside the dishwasher. 6. The water is then recycled and used again to continue cleaning the dishes until they are clean. 7. Once the cleaning cycle is finished, the water is then drained out of the dishwasher, passing through a filter. 8. This filter serves to collect any particles of food that were washed off the dishes during the cleaning process.

Look for sunglasses in brightly colored frames, such as peach, bright blue, or pink. This can add another level of summer to your look. Brimmed hats are great for staying cool in hot weather, as they protect your face from the sun and keep your body cool in the heat. Look for hats made of cotton or woven materials. Hats with a wide brim all the way around, sun hat style, or baseball hats are ideal for staying cool in hot weather. Many people suffer from swollen, sweaty feet in hot weather. You can prevent this by wearing shoes that are comfortable and not constraining. Look for shoes with comfortable soles made of breathable materials like canvas or cotton. Avoid shoes that are made of non-breathable material like leather, rubber, or other man-made materials.  You should also make sure your shoes fit your feet properly so they do not get irritated by your shoes. Feet often swell in heat so you may opt for open toe styles like sandals to ensure your feel have room to breath. If you are wearing closed toe shoes, you should wear socks so there is no rubbing or chaffing of your feet in your shoes. Perhaps one of the most important accessories in hot weather is sunscreen. You should apply sunscreen to any bare skin that will be exposed to the sun before you go outside. This will protect you from harmful UV rays and ensure you are not at risk of skin cancer or other skin related issues.

The first principle is the commitment to sustainable development. It recognizes the need for each member state to seek long-term and sustainable forms of energy. This need arises from the growing global concern about the environmental impact of conventional energy sources such as fossil fuels. Sustainable energy forms such as solar, wind, hydro and geothermal not only provide a long-term solution to energy needs, but also help to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, thereby aiding in the fight against climate change. The second principle referred to is the principle of subsidiarity. This is a fundamental principle of the European Union. At its core, the principle of subsidiarity means that decisions should be taken as closely as possible to the citizen - in other words, at the local, regional or national level - wherever that makes the most sense. When it comes to energy policy, this means that each member state should have the ability to determine its own energy mix, taking into account its specific circumstances, resources and needs. This allows for flexibility and tailor-made solutions, while still working towards the common goal of energy sustainability.  In combination, these principles guide the approach towards energy policy in a way that aims for sustainability, while respecting the diverse circumstances and needs of different member states."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here, \\"That\\" is translated as \\"Se\\", \\"has clarified\\" as \\"on selventänyt\\", and \\"the matter\\" as \\"asiaa\\". Finnish uses postpositions instead of prepositions; hence, \\"the matter\\" became \\"asiaa\\", not \\"asian\\".  2. \\"and I wanted to pass on this explanation\\" - This phrase is translated in Finnish as \\"ja halusin välittää tämän selityksen\\". In this case, \\"and\\" is translated as \\"ja\\", \\"I wanted\\" as \\"halusin\\", \\"to pass on\\" as \\"välittää\\", \\"this\\" as \\"tämän\\", and \\"explanation\\" as \\"selityksen\\".  3. \\"to the House\\" - The Finnish equivalent for this phrase is \\"eduskunnalle\\". The Finnish parliament is known as \\"Eduskunta\\", and when you're passing something to the Parliament, in Finnish, it's \\"eduskunnalle\\". The \\"-lle\\" ending signifies the 'allative case' in Finnish, which is typically used for indicating direction or the recipient of something. Because the explanation is being passed \\"to the House/Parliament\\", the \\"-lle\\" ending is used. Therefore, when you're put the all parts together, \\"That has clarified the matter, and I wanted to pass on this explanation to the House.\\" translates to \\"Se on selventänyt asiaa, ja halusin välittää tämän selityksen eduskunnalle.\\" in Finnish.

Question: I read this background article the other day: Mantle melting can come about three ways: (1) when the temperature rises, (2) if the pressure lowers (which lowers the melting point), and (3) if water is added, which lowers the melting point. Two of these (1 and 3) might explain why there are volcanoes at convergent plate boundaries the temperature of the subducting plate increases as it sinks into the hot mantle (1). Sediments lying on top of the subducting plate contain water. As the sediments subduct, the water rises into the overlying mantle material. This lowers the melting temperature of the mantle (3). When the mantle above the subducting plate melts, volcanoes form above it. This leads to volcanoes in an island arc or continental arc.  I am facing a new situation today: Two scientist, Pete and Gill, studied the Earth's crust and geology. Pete studied earthquakes, while Gill studied mantles and volcanos.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which person studied less about sediments lying on top of the subducting plate? Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided, Gill, who studied mantles and volcanos, would have studied more about sediments lying on top of the subducting plate.

Write an article based on this summary: The British biathlon team have pulled out of the Russian leg of a World Cup event.","output":"Title: British Biathlon Team Withdraws from World Cup Event in Russia: A Stand against Doping and Political Tensions Introduction The British biathlon team has made the bold decision to withdraw from the Russian leg of a prestigious World Cup event. This unexpected move has reverberated through the sporting community, not only in the United Kingdom but across the world. As the news spread, speculation arose as to what prompted this surprising action. Primarily, it showcases a clear stance against the issue of doping in sports and the political tensions surrounding Russia and the United Kingdom. In this article, we delve into the various factors that contributed to this decision and analyze its potential impact on future sporting events. Doping Scandals and the Russian Sporting Community Over the years, Russia has faced numerous doping scandals that have tarnished the reputation of its athletes and the nation as a whole. The widespread use of performance-enhancing drugs in Russian sports has led to frequent suspensions and bans on their athletes. Notably, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) banned Russia from the 2018 Winter Olympics in PyeongChang, South Korea, forcing clean athletes to participate as neutrals under the Olympic flag. The British biathlon team's withdrawal is a powerful statement, emphasizing the importance of fair competition and a zero-tolerance policy towards doping. By making this decision, British athletes are taking a stand against a tainted sporting culture and sending a message that their dedication to ethics takes precedence over the pursuit of medals. Political Tensions Between the UK and Russia In recent years, political tensions between the United Kingdom and Russia have been steadily escalating. The situation worsened after the poisoning of former Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia on British soil. The UK government attributed the attempted murder to the Russian state, inciting diplomatic tensions and the expulsion of Russian diplomats from the UK. The British biathlon team's withdrawal from the Russian leg of the World Cup could be interpreted as a continued manifestation of the strained relations between the two countries. While clear political motivations might not have been the primary reason for their withdrawal, the context adds weight to the team's decision and reaffirms the stance against any form of cooperation with a country that has been involved in alleged instances of state-sponsored violence. Implications for Future Sporting Events The decision by the British biathlon team has the potential to influence other sporting teams and associations. It emphasizes the importance of fair and ethical competition, and it might encourage other teams to reevaluate their participation in events hosted by nations facing doping scandals. This could prompt countries with tainted reputations to take decisive action to reform their sporting communities. At the same time, there could be a potential backlash, with some arguing that sports and politics should not mix. Critics may claim that the British team's withdrawal could exacerbate existing tensions rather than promote cooperation and understanding through sports diplomacy. Conclusion The British biathlon team's decision to withdraw from the Russian leg of a World Cup event has prompted significant conversations around issues of doping, ethics, and fair competition in sports. While this move may have been primarily driven by a commitment to ethical practices, it is difficult to ignore the political context. Ultimately, regardless of the motivations behind their withdrawal, the British biathlon team's stance against unfair competition and doping highlights the ongoing struggle to maintain integrity in sports and sends a powerful message that underscores the importance of fair play and adherence to the rules, both on and off the field."},{"instruction":"Read the article and select the best answer.

To do so, divide both sides of the equation by -6759:  -824598 / -6759 = -6759n / -6759 This simplifies to: n = 122 So, the solution of the equation -236537 = -6759n + 588061 for n is 122. This means that if you substitute n = 122 into the original equation, both sides of the equation should balance. Let's check: -236537 =? -6759*122 + 588061 When you do the arithmetic, you find: -236537 = -825418 + 588061 And indeed, -825418 + 588061 equals -236537, confirming that n = 122 is the correct solution to the equation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The phenomenon of biochemical processes' serving to regulate distant tissues by means of secretions directly into the circulatory system is called endocrine signaling. The major endocrine glands include the pineal gland, pituitary gland, pancreas, ovaries, testes, thyroid gland, parathyroid gland, and adrenal glands. The endocrine system is in contrast to the exocrine system, which secretes its hormones to the outside of the body using ducts. The endocrine system is an information signal system like the nervous system, yet its effects and mechanism are classifiably different. The endocrine system's effects are slow to initiate, and prolonged in their response, lasting from a few hours up to weeks. The nervous system sends information very quickly, and responses are generally short lived. In vertebrates, the hypothalamus is the neural control center for all endocrine systems. The field of study dealing with the endocrine system and its disorders is endocrinology, a branch of internal medicine. Special features of endocrine glands are, in general, their ductless nature, their vascularity, and commonly the presence of intracellular vacuoles or granules that store their hormones. In contrast, exocrine glands, such as salivary glands, sweat glands, and glands within the gastrointestinal tract, tend to be much less vascular and have ducts or a hollow lumen.  - A hormone (from the Greek participle ) is any member of a class of signaling molecules produced by glands in multicellular organisms that are transported by the circulatory system to target distant organs to regulate physiology and behaviour. Hormones have diverse chemical structures, mainly of 3 classes: eicosanoids, steroids, and amino acid derivatives (amines, peptides, and proteins). The glands that secrete hormones comprise the endocrine signaling system. The term hormone is sometimes extended to include chemicals produced by cells that affect the same cell (autocrine or intracrine signalling) or nearby cells (paracrine signalling).  - An anesthesiologist (American English) or anaesthetist (British English) is a physician trained in anesthesia and perioperative medicine.  - The pancreas is a glandular organ in the digestive system and endocrine system of vertebrates. In humans, it is located in the abdominal cavity behind the stomach. It is an endocrine gland producing several important hormones, including insulin, glucagon, somatostatin, and pancreatic polypeptide which circulate in the blood. The pancreas is also a digestive organ, secreting pancreatic juice containing digestive enzymes that assist digestion and absorption of nutrients in the small intestine. These enzymes help to further break down the carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids in the chyme. The pancreas is also known as mixed gland.  - The stomach is a muscular, hollow, dilated part of the gastrointestinal tract that functions as an important organ in the digestive system. The stomach is present in many animals including vertebrates, echinoderms, insects (mid-gut), and molluscs. In humans and many other vertebrates it is involved in the second phase of digestion, following mastication (chewing).  - Liver transplantation or hepatic transplantation is the replacement of a diseased liver with some or all of a healthy liver from another person (allograft). The most commonly used technique is phototropic transplantation, in which the native liver is removed and replaced by the donor organ in the same anatomic location as the original liver. Liver transplantation is a viable treatment option for end-stage liver disease and acute liver failure. Typically three surgeons and two anesthesiologists are involved, with up to four supporting nurses. The surgical procedure is very demanding and ranges from 4 to 18 hours depending on outcome. Numerous anastomoses and sutures, and many disconnections and reconnections of abdominal and liver tissue, must be made for the transplant to succeed, requiring an eligible recipient and a well-calibrated live or cadaveric donor match.  - A cadaver, also called corpse (singular) in medical, literary, and legal usage, or when intended for dissection, is a deceased body. The obsolete British term \\"lich\\" for \\"corpse\\", sometimes spelled \\"lych\\", is no longer even listed in major British dictionaries such as Longman, Macmillan, Cambridge, or Oxford Online Dictionaries. However, the term \\"lich\\" has been revived in modern fantasy fiction for a type of \\"undead\\" creature.  - Echinoderm is the common name given to any member of the phylum Echinodermata (from Ancient Greek, , \\"echinos\\"  \\"hedgehog\\" and , \\"derma\\"  \\"skin\\") of marine animals. The adults are recognizable by their (usually five-point) radial symmetry, and include such well-known animals as sea stars, sea urchins, sand dollars, and sea cucumbers, as well as the sea lilies or \\"stone lilies\\". Echinoderms are found at every ocean depth, from the intertidal zone to the abyssal zone. The phylum contains about 7000 living species, making it the second-largest grouping of deuterostomes (a superphylum), after the chordates (which include the vertebrates, such as birds, fishes, mammals, and reptiles). Echinoderms are also the largest phylum that has no freshwater or terrestrial (land-based) representatives.  - Pancreatic juice is a liquid secreted by the pancreas, which contains a variety of enzymes, including trypsinogen, chymotrypsinogen, elastase, carboxypeptidase, pancreatic lipase, nucleases and amylase. The pancreas is located in the visceral region, and is a major part of the digestive system required for proper digestion and subsequent assimilation of macronutrient substances required for living.   - Endocrine glands are glands of the endocrine system that secrete their products, \\"hormones\\", directly into the blood rather than through a duct. The major glands of the endocrine system include the pineal gland, pituitary gland, pancreas, ovaries, testes, thyroid gland, parathyroid gland, hypothalamus and adrenal glands. The hypothalamus and pituitary gland are neuroendocrine organs.  Local chemical messengers, not generally considered part of the endocrine system, include autocrines, which act on the cells that secrete them, and paracrines, which act on a different cell type nearby.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Obama advances U.S. goals in India One of the more common criticisms of President Obama’s foreign policy from the right is that he’s scaled back U.S. efforts to influence the world, withdrawing America from its traditional leadership post. The Republican whining has always been more ironic than credible, largely because Obama has spent six years doing the exact opposite. The parade was the visual centerpiece of Mr. Obama’s three-day trip, a colorful mélange of modern-day military hardware, soldiers in traditional turbans and costumes riding camels, and a series of floats from myriad states capturing different aspects of India’s rich and complicated cultures. The invitation to Mr. Obama to attend in the position of honor was an important diplomatic gesture. […] Mr. Obama’s decision to accept the invitation to be chief guest was seen here as a great tribute to India, heralded by politicians and the news media as a sign of the country’s importance on the world stage. An announcer told the crowd that it was “a proud moment for every Indian.” What’s more, the NYT report added that Obama and Modi “renewed the 10-year defense pact between the two countries on Sunday and agreed to cooperate on aircraft carrier and jet engine technology. They also agreed to work on joint production of small-scale surveillance drones.” There’s also the broader, geo-political landscape to consider. Clearly, Obama has prioritized improved relations with India, seeing it as an important goal on its own, but there’s also a context to remember. Obama came into office hoping to make a “pivot to Asia,” and he’s spent six years trying to shift U.S. foreign policy in that direction, despite distractions and rebuffs, in an effort to align U.S. interests with those of the world’s most rapidly growing populations and economies. As part of that strategy and an effort to counterbalance China, Obama has looked to bolster India – which is on course to overtake China as the world’s most populous nation – to make sure China has a strong rival in the region. But for Obama, like Bill Clinton and George W. Bush before him, the Indian relationship itself has so far been a huge investment of American time and money with little to show. So now, on the first foreign trip of his final two years and with a mind on building his legacy, Obama’s spending three days in New Delhi trying again. China, said Jon Huntsman, Obama’s first ambassador in Beijing, “will be implied in everything they do, and everything they discuss.” If Republicans see all of this and continue to assume the president is retreating from the world stage, they’re just not paying close enough attention. UP, 1/25/15, 9:01 AM ET NBC’s Chris Jansing reports on President Obama’s highly symbolic visit to India. Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"President Obama worked on improving the relationship between the United States and India, to help make India feel more important in the world and to help balance power in Asia.

During the 19th century, steamers had begun to visit Hirta, enabling the islanders to earn money from the sale of tweeds and birds' eggs but at the expense of their self-esteem as the tourists regarded them as curiosities. It is also clear that the St Kildans were not so naïve as they sometimes appeared. \\"For example, when they boarded a yacht they would pretend they thought all the polished brass was gold, and that the owner must be enormously wealthy\\". The boats brought other previously unknown diseases, especially tetanus infantum, which resulted in infant mortality rates as high as 80 percent during the late 19th century. The cnatan na gall or boat-cough, an illness that struck after the arrival of a ship off Hirta, became a regular feature of life.By the early 20th century, formal schooling had again become a feature of the islands, and in 1906 the church was extended to make a schoolhouse. The children all now learned English and their native Scottish Gaelic. Improved midwifery skills, denied to the island by John Mackay, reduced the problems of childhood tetanus. From the 1880s, trawlers fishing the north Atlantic made regular visits, bringing additional trade. Talk of an evacuation occurred in 1875 during MacKay's time as minister, but despite occasional food shortages and a flu epidemic in 1913, the population was stable at between 75 and 80, and no obvious sign existed that within a few years the millennia-old occupation of the island was to end. contains an answer for the question: Who did the tourists regard as curiosities?, what is it ? A:","output":"The tourists regarded the islanders of Hirta, who are also known as St. Kildans, as curiosities. This was emphasized when the locals began to interact more with the outside world, as steamers brought tourists to the remote islands, exposing the St. Kildans to modern lifestyles and culture. These tourists observed the St. Kildans' way of life with fascination and sometimes even condescension, treating them as exotic or unusual attractions. This, in turn, affected the islanders' self-esteem as they engaged in trade with these visitors and felt diminished by the outsider's perception of their culture and daily life."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer this question: Sardines and pilchards belong to which family of fish?","output":"Sardines and pilchards are small, oily fish that belong to the family Clupeidae, within the order Clupeiformes. This family is particularly diverse and contains several subfamilies, genera, and species. Clupeids are often characterized by their silver bodies, single dorsal fin, and strong, deeply forked tails. These fish are commonly found in both marine and freshwater environments around the world, with a notable presence in the Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific oceans. Sardines and pilchards are not distinct species in themselves but rather terms used to describe various species of small, oily fish within the Clupeidae family. The common name \\"sardine\\" is derived from the Mediterranean island of Sardinia, where these fish were once abundant and today, sardines generally refer to young, small-sized fish of numerous species within the Clupeidae family. Similarly, \\"pilchards\\" is a term used to describe larger adult fish of specific species within the same family, particularly those found in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. One of the most commonly known species classified as sardines is the European pilchard (Sardina pilchardus), which is widespread across the Northeast Atlantic, Mediterranean Sea, and the Black Sea. Other commonly recognized species include the American Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus), and the American Atlantic menhaden (Brevoortia tyrannus). The Clupeidae family has great ecological and economic significance, as these fish serve as essential components within their respective ecosystems. Sardines and pilchards are crucial prey for a wide range of marine predators, such as larger fish, seabirds, and marine mammals, making them vital contributors to the marine food chain. Furthermore, these fish are primary consumers that feed on plankton, playing a significant role in connecting the primary producers (phytoplankton) to higher trophic levels. In addition to their ecological importance, sardines and pilchards hold substantial economic value. They are captured worldwide for human consumption and are typically marketed as fresh, canned, or smoked products. Due to their rich nutritional profile, which includes high protein content, omega-3 fatty acids, and essential vitamins and minerals, these fish are considered an important dietary source and are consumed in various global cuisines. Additionally, they serve as a crucial source of fishmeal and fish oil used in the aquaculture and agricultural industries. In conclusion, sardines and pilchards are vital members of the Clupeidae family, a diverse group of small, oily fish that hold tremendous ecological and economic significance. This family encompasses numerous subfamilies, genera, and species, with members serving as essential links in marine food chains and contributing to the overall health of aquatic ecosystems. Sardines and pilchards provide vital nutritional benefits to humans and serve as crucial sources of fishmeal and fish oil for various industries."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It didn't.It's a poorly-constructed ramble of a dot-commer who moves into Federal government and foils a \\"dastardly\\" plot in the post 9/11 era - all rubbish. The plot moves in fits and starts. The main character is unbelievable. The bit about using spam as an energy source is utterly pathetic (I don't think that would count as a spoiler).To summarise, if you want a good read, check out Richard Morgan's \\"Altered Carbon\\" or \\"Fallen Angels\\", or Stephenson's Baroque Cycle. Answer: The answer is:","output":"No, based on the presented review, it is highly unlikely that the user would recommend this product. The user expresses their disappointment with the book, mentioning that it's a poorly-constructed ramble with an unbelievable main character and a plot that moves in fits and starts. They even label a particular aspect of the story (using spam as an energy source) as \\"utterly pathetic\\". The user clearly did not enjoy reading the book, as they state that they finished it just to see if anything decent would happen, only to find that it didn't. To further emphasize their dissatisfaction, they suggest alternative books as better reads, such as Richard Morgan's \\"Altered Carbon\\" and \\"Fallen Angels,\\" as well as Stephenson's Baroque Cycle. In conclusion, given the negative and critical tone of the review, it is safe to assume that the user would not recommend this product to others.

Answer based on context: Blanche of Navarre, however, proved to be an incredibly strong and efficient regent, and had devoted herself for the past 15 years to ensuring the legal status of her son Theobald IV as rightful heir.  Blanche was aided in securing her powerbase during the first few shakey years of her regency by the fact that so many lords and knights of the county, who might have posed a challenge to her, had left to fight on the Fourth Crusade from 1202 to 1204.  Queen Mother Adèle of Champagne  also took Blanche under her wing, giving Blanche vital counsel during the early years of her regency until Adèle's death in 1206 . By 1216, despite the fact that Erard rallied most of the local barons of the county against Blanche, she had built up such strong alliances with both King Philip II as well as Pope Innocent III that Erard never gained any official legal support for his claims.  From the start of the conflict, Pope Innocent III began excommunicating rebel barons, negatively affecting their efforts.  Further, while Theobald IV was still an underaged youth of 13 years, he had acquitted himself so valiantly in combat at the decisive Battle of Bouvines that King Philip II threw his full support behind him . Who was the mother of Theobald IV","output":"The mother of Theobald IV was Blanche of Navarre. Blanche was the wife of Theobald III, Count of Champagne, and played a vital role in ensuring the legal status of her son Theobald IV as the rightful heir to the County of Champagne. As a strong and efficient regent, she devoted herself to securing her son's position and power during her regency, forming alliances with key figures such as King Philip II of France and Pope Innocent III. Her guidance, along with the support from Queen Mother Adèle of Champagne, helped Theobald IV maintain his claim as Count of Champagne amidst challenges from competing factions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question: What is torn apart in a storm? Movie title: Doctor Dolittle Movie plot: During the opening credits, which feature animations of various animals, the orchestra plays an overture of three songs from the film, most notably \\"Talk to the Animals.\\" The action begins in the quaint 19th century English seaside village of Puddleby-on-the-Marsh. Matthew Mugg, an Irish fishmonger, meets his young friend Tom Stubbins, as Matt wheels his fish barrow around the wharf collecting fresh seafood for his customers. Matthew rescues an injured duck from a fisherman who intends to eat it for his dinner. As soon as Matthew finishes his rounds, he tells Tom they will take the duck to John Dolittle, the greatest animal doctor in the world. Matthew explains that Dolittle talks to the animals to determine what ails them. To explain further, Matthew sings \\"My Friend the Doctor.\\" During the song Tom accompanies Matthew as he makes his deliveries to his customers. By the time the song ends, they have arrived at Dolittle's house. When a chimpanzee and a parrot answer the door, Matthew introduces Chee-Chee and Polynesia to Tom. After the introductions, they go into the library where Dr. Dolittle is trying to converse with some goldfish. He explains to Matthew and Tom that he is attempting to gather information about the legendary Great Pink Sea Snail. He soon plans to embark on a voyage to find the creature. Tom takes the duck out of his coat where he has been keeping it safe and hands it to the doctor. After a few quacks back and forth, Dolittle is certain that the drake has had a row with his wife. The doctor invites Tom and Matthew to dinner and instructs Polynesia, the parrot, to prepare for two more guests. Tom and Matthew had encountered a thunderstorm on the way to Dolittle's, so the good doctor furnishes them with dry clothes. When they return from changing out of their wet togs, Chee-Chee is frying sausages and bacon while a pig is squealing his displeasure. The doctor doesn't join them for dinner.

If you build a campfire, you start with a large stack of sticks and logs. As the fire burns, the stack slowly shrinks. By the end of the evening, all that is left is a small pile of ashes. What happened to the matter that you started with? Was it destroyed by the flames? It may seem that way. What do you think happened? The truth is that the same amount of matter still exists. The wood changed not only to ashes, but also to carbon dioxide, water vapor, and other gases. The gases floated off into the air, leaving behind just the ashes. Although matter was changed, it was not created or destroyed. Because the same amount of matter still exists, we can say that matter is conserved.

This tiny, sun-drenched oasis is also home to Audrey's best friend, Calista, who dreams of beauty pageants and love affairs while struggling with illness and fear of the future. Dependable, level-headed Audrey is equally uncertain about what the future holds. Surrounded by loved ones who need taking care of, including her devoted, agoraphobic father and the ethereal Calista, Audrey can't imagine a life away from the familiar open skies and languid pace of Dreamland.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - Karabakh (\\"Gharabagh\\" or , \\"Artsakh\\") is a geographic region in present-day eastern Armenia and southwestern Azerbaijan, extending from the highlands of the Lesser Caucasus down to the lowlands between the rivers Kura and Aras. It includes three regions: Highland Karabakh (historical Artsakh, present-day Nagorno-Karabakh), Lowland Karabakh (the southern Kura-steppes), and a part of Syunik.  - Armenia ( tr. \\"Hayastan\\"), officially the Republic of Armenia (tr. \\"Hayastani Hanrapetutyun\\"), is a sovereign state in the South Caucasus region of Eurasia. Located in Western Asia on the \\"Armenian Highlands\\", it is bordered by Turkey to the west, Russia and Georgia to the north and Azerbaijan to the east, and Iran and Azerbaijan's exclave of Nakhchivan to the south.  - Azerbaijan, officially the Republic of Azerbaijan, is a country in the South Caucasus region, situated at the crossroads of Southwest Asia and Southeastern Europe. It is bounded by the Caspian Sea to the east, Russia to the north, Georgia to the northwest, Armenia to the west and Iran to the south. The exclave of Nakhchivan is bounded by Armenia to the north and east, Iran to the south and west, while having an 8 km border with Turkey in the north west.  - Nagorno-Karabakh, officially the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic (NKR; \\"Lernayin Gharabaghi Hanrapetut'yun\\"), Artsakh Republic or Republic of Artsakh (\\"Arts'akhi Hanrapetut'yun\\"), is an unrecognised republic in the South Caucasus. The region is considered by the UN to be part of Azerbaijan, but is under the control of ethnic Armenian separatists. The NKR controls most of the territory of the former Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast and some of the surrounding area, giving it a border with Armenia to the west, Iran to the south, and the uncontested territory of Azerbaijan to the north and east.  - The Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast (\\"Lernayin arabai Inknavar Marz, LIM\\") was an autonomous oblast within the borders of the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic, mostly inhabited by ethnic Armenians. According to Robert Service, in 1921 Joseph Stalin, then acting Commissar of Nationalities for the Soviet Union, included Nakhichevan Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic and Karabakh under Azerbaijani control to try to placate Turkey to join the Soviet Union. Had Turkey not been an issue, Stalin would probably have left Karabakh under Armenian control. As a result, the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Oblast was established with the Azerbaijan Soviet Socialist Republic on July 7, 1923. According to Karl R. DeRouen it was created as an enclave so that a narrow strip of land would separate it from Armenia proper. According to Audrey L. Altstadt, the borders of the \\"oblast\\" were drawn to include Armenian villages and to exclude as much as possible Azerbaijani villages, so that the resulting area was sure to have an Armenian majority.  - Arkadi Ghukasyan ( Armenian :   , born 22 June 1957 ) was the third President of the self - proclaimed Nagorno - Karabakh Republic . He was elected as the President on 8 September 1997 and re-elected in 2002 , until his term ended on 19 July 2007 and was succeeded by Bako Sahakyan . Born in Stepanakert , in the Nagorno Karabakh Autonomous Republic of the Azerbaijan SSR on 22 June 1957 , he graduated in 1979 from Yerevan State University with a degree in linguistics .

Comprising a land area of , it is the second-largest country in the Middle East and the 18th-largest in the world. With 82.8 million inhabitants, Iran is the world's 17th-most-populous country. It is the only country with both a Caspian Sea and an Indian Ocean coastline. The country's central location in Eurasia and Western Asia, and its proximity to the Strait of Hormuz, make it of great geostrategic importance. Tehran is the country's capital and largest city, as well as its leading economic center.  - The Caucasus or Caucasia is a region at the border of Europe and Asia, situated between the Black and the Caspian seas.    What is the relationship between 'arkadi ghukasyan' and 'armenians'? Answer:","output":"Arkadi Ghukasyan is an important figure in the Armenian community, particularly for the ethnic Armenians in the Nagorno-Karabakh region. Born in Stepanakert, in the Nagorno-Karabakh Autonomous Republic of the Azerbaijan SSR, he grew up among Armenians and went on to hold influential positions in the self-proclaimed Nagorno-Karabakh Republic (NKR), which is predominantly inhabited by ethnic Armenians.  Ghukasyan, who graduated from the Yerevan State University with a degree in linguistics, initially started his career in the field of journalism, working as a correspondent for the \\"Soviet Karabagh\\" newspaper. Eventually, he became the Deputy Editor-in-Chief of the paper. His involvement in the media allowed him to connect with the Armenian community and represent their interests in the media sphere. In 1991, Ghukasyan was elected to the first Parliament of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, marking the beginning of his political career. He took on important roles and responsibilities within the NKR, including being appointed Political Adviser to the Chairman of the State Defense Committee, heading the NKR delegations during OSCE negotiations with Azerbaijan, and becoming a member of Nagorno-Karabakh's Security Council.  On July 23, 1993, Ghukasyan assumed the position of the first Foreign Minister of the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic. As Foreign Minister and later the President of the NKR, he played a crucial role in representing the voice and interests of the ethnic Armenians living in the region. His leadership and tenure in these positions demonstrated his commitment to the Armenian cause and the establishment of the unrecognised republic, which is considered by the United Nations to be part of Azerbaijan.  Arkadi Ghukasyan was elected as the third President of the NKR on September 8, 1997, and re-elected in 2002, serving until July 19, 2007, when he was succeeded by Bako Sahakyan. During his presidency, Ghukasyan faced significant challenges, including an assassination attempt in 2000, which he survived. The alleged orchestrator of the attack was Samvel Babayan, the former defense minister, who was later convicted and sentenced to 14 years in prison. In conclusion, the relationship between Arkadi Ghukasyan and Armenians is deeply rooted in his personal background and his political career, which has largely focused on advocating for and representing the interests of the ethnic Armenians, particularly those living in the Nagorno-Karabakh region. His positions as Foreign Minister and President of the NKR showcase his dedication and commitment to the Armenian cause, making him an essential figure in the Armenian community."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the title of this article: Seal script, which had evolved slowly in the state of Qin during the Eastern Zhou dynasty, became standardized and adopted as the formal script for all of China in the Qin dynasty (leading to a popular misconception that it was invented at that time), and was still widely used for decorative engraving and seals (name chops, or signets) in the Han dynasty period. However, despite the Qin script standardization, more than one script remained in use at the time. For example, a little-known, rectilinear and roughly executed kind of common (vulgar) writing had for centuries coexisted with the more formal seal script in the Qin state, and the popularity of this vulgar writing grew as the use of writing itself became more widespread. By the Warring States period, an immature form of clerical script called \\"early clerical\\" or \\"proto-clerical\\" had already developed in the state of Qin based upon this vulgar writing, and with influence from seal script as well. The coexistence of the three scripts – small seal, vulgar and proto-clerical, with the latter evolving gradually in the Qin to early Han dynasties into clerical script – runs counter to the traditional belief that the Qin dynasty had one script only, and that clerical script was suddenly invented in the early Han dynasty from the small seal script.

The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the work whose status as the decade's best pop album should not be in doubt? , can you please find it?   Gary Mulholland of The Observer considers the release of Is This It a \\"world-changing moment\\" and notes that its impact was \\"immediate and dramatic\\" on both music and attire. BBC Radio 1's Zane Lowe suggests that the album moved popular opinion from DJs and pop music to \\"skinny jeans and guitars\\", \\"the template for rock 'n' roll in the modern day\\". Tam Gunn of FACT agrees and explains that it \\"caused a sea change\\" in mainstream music in the US and the UK, while Anthony Miccio of Stylus points out that the Strokes' success created the commercial context for \\"other new-wavers\\" to flourish. Rolling Stone writes that Is This It inspired \\"a ragged revolt\\" in Britain, led by the Libertines and Arctic Monkeys, and continued its influence in the US on the success of bands like Kings of Leon. The Observer shares a similar view and concludes that \\"a fine brood of heirs\\", like the Libertines and Franz Ferdinand, would not have existed and been successful if the Strokes had not reinvigorated \\"rock's obsession with having a good time\\".

Syria has four chemical weapons facilities that it did not previously disclose to the United Nations, a Western diplomat told CNN on Tuesday. The diplomat said Sigrid Kaag, the U.N. special envoy overseeing the destruction of Syria's chemical stockpiles, briefed the U.N. Security Council. Three of the sites are research and development facilities and one is a production facility, according to the source. Syria disclosed the information during ongoing meetings between the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons and Syrian authorities, Kaag told the council members, according to the source. U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Samantha Power tweeted shortly after: \\"Must keep pressure on regime so it doesn't hide (chemical weapons) capability.\\" In August 2013, U.N. spokesman Martin Nesirky told reporters that a team of experts had gathered to go to Syria to investigate reports of chemical weapons. In September 2013, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon released the inspectors' report, which says there was \\"clear and convincing evidence\\" that sarin, a nerve agent developed for chemical warfare, was used in a Damascus attack. Later that month, the U.N. Security Council passed a resolution requiring Syria to eliminate its chemical weapons arsenal, and President Bashar al-Assad promised to adhere to the resolution. The following month, Syria began dismantling its chemical weapons program. In July, 600 metric tons of chemical weapons from Syria were transferred to a U.S. ship for destruction in what marked the demise of the last of the country's declared chemical weapons stockpiles. At the time, officials said it was a major milestone. But inspectors have said they couldn't say for sure whether some undeclared weapons were still lurking somewhere in the country. And in August, there were new allegations of chlorine attacks, officials said. After inspectors' findings were detailed in Tuesday's closed-door Security Council briefing, diplomats took to Twitter with statements that echoed accusations aimed at the Syrian government a year ago. \\"Witnesses of chlorine gas attacks described them as carried out by helicopters, which only Syrian regime has. All fingers point to Assad,\\" Power said. \\"Connect the dots: @OPCW sure chlorine used in #Syria, witnesses saw it dropped by helicopters, which only Assad has. Who's responsible? #UNSC,\\" the Lithuanian mission to the United Nations, a current member of the Security Council, tweeted. The Syrian mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to CNN. Asked about the revelation of additional Syrian chemical weapons facilities, State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki pointed to a recent statement from Secretary of State John Kerry, which said the United States was \\"gravely concerned\\" about the recent reports of chlorine attacks in Syria. \\"This finding, coupled with deep concerns regarding the accuracy and completeness of Syria's declaration to the (Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons), raises especially troubling concerns that continued chemical attacks on the Syrian people by the regime could occur,\\" Kerry said last month. CNN's Ashley Fantz, Ben Brumfield, Diana Magnay and Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report. Write highlights for this article.","output":"1.

Burton was born to American parents at the U.S. Army Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in West Germany. His mother, Erma Gene (nee Christian), was a social worker, administrator, and educator. His father, Levardis Robert Martyn Burton, was a photographer for the U.S. Army Signal Corps at the time he was stationed at Landstuhl. Burton and his two sisters were raised by his mother in Sacramento, California. Burton first appeared on television in a drama about a misunderstood deaf boy. LeVar Burton made his film acting debut in 1977 when he played Kunta Kinte in the ABC award-winning drama series Roots, based on the novel by Alex Haley. Burton's audition for the role of Kinte was the first of his professional career. As a result of his performance, he was nominated for the Emmy for Best Actor in a Drama Series. Burton reprised the role of Kunta Kinte in the 1988 television film Roots: The Gift. When asked about the societal impacts of Roots, Burton is quoted as saying, \\"It expanded the consciousness of people. Blacks and whites began to see each other as human beings, not as stereotypes. And if you throw a pebble into the pond, you're going to get ripples. I think the only constant is change, and it's always slow. Anything that happens overnight is lacking in foundation.

The terminal would have been built on Lelu Island, which sits at the mouth of the Skeena river near Prince Rupert, British Columbia. There were worries over the potential threat to an important salmon habitat alongside concerns over greenhouse gases.

Write a summary based on this article:  Republican City Councilman Kevin Faulconer won a decisive victory over Democratic Councilman David Alvarez in the San Diego mayor’s race Tuesday, signaling a new chapter for the city after the scandal-plagued tenure of former Mayor Bob Filner.      Faulconer had 54.5 percent compared to Alvarez’s 45.5 percent of the vote with all precincts reporting.      A Faulconer victory breathes new life into the local Republican Party by restoring its control of the Mayor’s Office that its candidates have occupied for much of the past four decades. Faulconer also becomes the only Republican mayor of a top 10 U.S. city, making him one of the party’s highest-profile leaders in the state.      The results dashed the hopes of Alvarez to become San Diego’s first Latino mayor and its youngest in nearly 120 years. It also blunted a push by Democrats to have a like-minded mayor join the party’s 5-4 majority on the City Council to shepherd a new era of progressive politics for America’s Finest City.      The runoff election will fill the vacancy left by Democrat Bob Filner’s Aug. 30 resignation stemming from a sexual harassment scandal. Faulconer will finish the remaining 33 months on Filner’s term and be up for re-election in 2016.

Alvarez later told U-T San Diego that the issues confronting the city won’t change, regardless of the election results.      “We still have a lot of work ahead regardless of the outcome,” he said. “I look forward to that as mayor or as a member of the council.”      He later said on Twitter that he called Faulconer and conceded the election. “I want to congratulate Kevin Faulconer. It’s clear that he will be the next mayor of San Diego. I look forward to working with him,” he wrote.      Faulconer responded to Alvarez via Twitter: \\"Thank you for a respectful campaign. As mayor, I look forward to working with you to move our city forward.\\"      Conventional wisdom held that Faulconer would have a lead among the mail ballots collected before Election Day, but the 13-point edge he held at 8 p.m. when those results were released was much larger than most pundits expected. An early advantage for Faulconer was anticipated because Republican-leaning voters have historically been consistent and reliable voters in most elections, especially in special ones. ||||| SAN DIEGO -- Republican Councilman Kevin Faulconer defeated Democratic Councilman David Alvarez, 54.5% to 45.5%, to become the city's next mayor, according to unofficial results tallied by the county registrar of voters.      The tally includes all absentee votes and votes from all 582 precincts. Unofficial turnout for the special election was 37%.      Alvarez, 33, said he called Faulconer to offer his congratulations and say that he looks forward to working with the new mayor. If elected, Alvarez would have been the youngest and first Latino mayor in modern San Diego history.      Faulconer, a former public relations executive before entering politics, promised that he and Alvarez will work together \\"to move our city forward.\\"      Acting Mayor Todd Gloria, a Democrat who endorsed Alvarez, praised the Alvarez campaign: \\"Son of a janitor and fast-food worker; his story is proof that anything is possible in San Diego.\\"      Faulconer, 47, told cheering supporters Tuesday night that he \\"can't wait to be the next mayor of this fabulous and great city.\\"      He also allowed himself a not-so-veiled reference to the now-passed era of ex-Mayor Bob Filner, who resigned Aug. 31 after months of a chaotic management style at City Hall followed by multiple accusations of sexual harassment.      \\"This city has gone through a lot in the last year, but we knew that as San Diegans we were better than that,\\" Faulconer said.      Faulconer is to be sworn in March 3 to serve the final 33 months of Filner's term.      Filner, 71, was the city's first Democratic mayor in two decades. He is now serving a 90-day home-confinement sentence after pleading guilty to three charges of mistreating women.

But I can use this background: As time passes, the number of HIV copies keeps increasing, while the number of helper T cells keeps decreasing. The graph in Figure below shows how the number of T cells typically declines over a period of many years following the initial HIV infection. As the number of T cells decreases, so does the ability of the immune system to defend the body. As a result, an HIV-infected person develops frequent infections. Medicines can slow down the virus but not get rid of it, so there is no cure at present for HIV infections or AIDS.

However, Prot's unwavering ability to provide cogent answers to questions about himself, K-PAX, and its civilization leads Dr. Powell to introduce him to a group of astrophysicists, where Prot claims to have journeyed to Earth by means of \\"light-travel\\" and goes on to display rare knowledge that resolves a puzzle for them.After Prot explains that his people do not live in families, Dr. Powell invites Prot to his home for a July fourth picnic. Prot translates for the dog, eats, learns about Dr. Powell's family problems, and plays with the children until the sprinkler turns on and he freaks out.Prot exhibits considerable influence over the other patients at the Institute, each of whom believes unquestioningly that he is indeed from K-PAX. Prot has explained that he can take one person with him when he returns; thereafter most of the patients at the institute ask to be taken to K-PAX.Upon learning that many of his patients expect to leave Earth on July 27, Dr. Powell confronts Prot, who explains that it is a predetermined date. However, Powell believes this to be a significant date in Prot's life, a day on which he suffered a severe psychological trauma. Powell then decides to subject Prot to regression hypnosis, which works well. Using information gained from these sessions, Powell figures out that Prot is actually Robert Porter, a man presumed dead since attempting suicide after his wife and daughter were murdered in 1996.On July 27, what is thought to be Prot is found lying catatonic under his bed, and one of the other patients is also missing. The missing patient is never found, and Prot does not return. The other patients do not recognize Robert as he is being wheeled out of the room.

Ministers are being urged to take ‘urgent action’ after cancer patients in Scotland were given access to another drug not available in England and Wales. Axitinib, aimed at kidney cancer patients who have stopped responding to other treatments, is to be given the green light north of the border after it was shown to significantly extend life. The drug – which costs £3,000 a month – could potentially help 6,000 sufferers a year, but has so far been deemed not cost effective by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) for use on the NHS in England and Wales. The body is currently considering an appeal against its decision. Price of life: At a cost of £3,000 a month Axitimib is expensive but it has been shown to prolong life in cancer sufferers who have stopped responding to other treatments. Experts have expressed dismay at the latest example of ‘health apartheid’ between patients north and south of the border. The decision of the Scottish Medicines Consortium (SMC) to give the go-ahead for the drug in Scotland means taxpayers in England and Wales will have to contribute to the funding of the drug north of the border, but not benefit from it. Critics of NICE say it is judging drugs using criteria from the last century and said the case for a fundamental overhaul was now overwhelming. This year alone, the body has given only one positive recommendation for a new cancer medicine for NHS use, from the 12 ‘single technology’ appraisals on which it has made final or preliminary decisions. At the Conservative Party’s annual conference last month, David Cameron was forced to announce a two year extension to the £200million a year Cancer Drugs Fund – an emergency fund which funds treatments denied by NICE. But there are growing calls for more sweeping reforms. Professor Tom Powles, a consultant oncologist at Barts Health NHS Trust in London, said: ‘Whilst the SMC decision is good news for patients in Scotland, it’s important that all patients across the UK have routine access to innovative treatments. There is a clear need for kidney cancer treatments and it’s therefore very important that patients can have access to treatment options at all stages of the disease.’ Jonathan Emms, the UK Managing Director of Pfizer, which manufactures Axitinib, said: ‘Government needs to play its part in fixing age-old problems to ensure that innovative new medicines are used by the NHS and get to the patients that need them. ‘By continuing to focus on medicines as a cost not an investment, Government will not solve these issues. Instead it sends a clear message that innovation is not valued in the UK and it is not prepared to invest in life-saving and life-changing discoveries. Outdated: Critics of NICE say it is judging drugs using criteria from the last century and said the case for a fundamental overhaul was now overwhelming. ‘Decisions like today’s, where a vital cancer medicine is denied to patients in England and Wales by NICE, but at the same time approved for Scottish patients, further highlights the fundamental problems. We cannot allow this to become the norm. ‘The Prime Minister must take urgent action. A new pro-innovation mandate for NICE is needed to get patients the new medicines they need and prove that the UK is open for business.’ Ben Osborn, the firm’s oncology business unit head, added: ‘Whilst we welcome this decision for patients in Scotland, yet again we find ourselves in a situation where two health bodies, which have assessed similar information, reach an entirely different conclusion on the value of a medicine.’ Axitinib, which is marketed under the tradename Inlyta, is designed to treat adult patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma after failure of prior treatment with other drugs - sunitinib or a cytokine. One trial suggested it extended life by two months on average, with some patients surviving significantly longer. Patients in England will have to appeal to the Cancer Drugs Fund, though funding is not guaranteed. Patients in Wales have no access to any second line advanced treatment for kidney cancer and have to prove ‘exceptional circumstances’ in order to even be considered. Public Health England has warned that more people are being diagnosed with and dying from kidney cancer in England today, compared to ten years ago. Around 30 per cent currently present with late stage disease. Kidney cancer is the eighth most common cancer in the UK, with an estimated 3,850 people dying from the disease each year. Andrew Dillon, chief executive of NICE, said: ‘Axitinib is currently being looked at for NICE by an independent appraisal committee. Earlier this year a draft decision to say no to Axitinib was appealed and the drug is being considered again. ‘Decisions on which drugs to approve are often finely balanced. Health services have to be confident that the extra benefit to patients justifies the price. If we are not sure, we have to say so, in the interests of all those of us who expect the NHS to apply its resources equitably across all of the demands we make of it. ‘NICE is, quite properly, scrutinised closely on its decisions and the methods we use to arrive at them. 'We regularly review our methods to ensure they are consistent with the ambitions set for the NHS and we are currently considering ways to make sure that we take full account of the impact of the severity of different diseases and conditions, together with the wider benefits to society of new treatments. 'We have always relied on feedback to draft the very best processes and guidance. We have asked patients’ groups, industry and our other stakeholders to help us develop this new value assessment approach. Drugs, especially those for cancer, which extend life for terminally ill people, have been given special weight by NICE since January 2009.’ What are highlight points for this article?","output":"1.
