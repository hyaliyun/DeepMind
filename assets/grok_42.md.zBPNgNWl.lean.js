We need to prove that each (a_i) is equal to 1. # Detailed Steps: 1. **Representation of the Number**:     The given number (111ldots 11) (with 100 ones) can be written as:    [    sum_{i=0}^{99} 10^i    ] 2. **Sum of Digits Constraint**:     It is given that (a_0 + a_1 + cdots + a_{99} leq 100). 3. **Comparative Sum of Digits**:     Note that the sum of the digits of (111ldots 11) is exactly 100 because each digit is \`1\` and there are 100 digits. 4. **Equating and Understanding the Constraint**:    The number (111ldots 11) can indeed be written as:    [    1 cdot 10^0 + 1 cdot 10^1 + 1 cdot 10^2 + ldots + 1 cdot 10^{99}    ]    This matches exactly our desired sum where each (a_i = 1). 5. **Considering another Possibility**:    Suppose there is any (a_i) which is greater than 1 or any (a_i) which is 0. Then the left-hand side (LHS) which is (a_0 + a_1 + cdots + a_{99}) will either exceed 100 or be less than 100.  6. **Sum Constraint Violation**:    Any case where any (a_i neq 1) would violate the constraint (a_0 + a_1 + cdots + a_{99} leq 100) while still trying to sum up correctly to the numerical value represented by the infinite series. # Conclusion: Given the constraints and the structure of the problem, we must have each (a_i = 1) for (i=0) to (99).

Substituting this into the expression for ( a_m ), we get:    [    a_m = u + minleft{ frac{u^2 + v}{u}, 1 + frac{u^2 + v}{u+1} right}    ] 5. We need to compare ( frac{u^2 + v}{u} ) and ( 1 + frac{u^2 + v}{u+1} ):    [    frac{u^2 + v}{u} < 1 + frac{u^2 + v}{u+1} quad text{iff} quad v < u    ]    This implies ( a_m = f(u) ) when ( 0 leq v leq u-1 ) and ( a_m = f(u+1) ) when ( u leq v leq 2u ). 6. Using the above results, we can compute the sum:    [    sum_{v=0}^{2u} [a_{u^2 + v}] = sum_{v=0}^{u-1} left( u + leftlfloor frac{u^2 + v}{u} rightrfloor right) + sum_{v=u}^{2u} left( u + 1 + leftlfloor frac{u^2 + v}{u+1} rightrfloor right)    ] 7. Simplifying the sums:    [    sum_{v=0}^{u-1} left( u + leftlfloor frac{u^2 + v}{u} rightrfloor right) = sum_{v=0}^{u-1} (2u) = 2u^2    ]    [    sum_{v=u}^{2u} left( u + 1 + leftlfloor frac{u^2 + v}{u+1} rightrfloor right) = sum_{v=u}^{2u} (2u + 1) = (2u + 1)(u + 1)    ] 8. Combining these results:    [    sum_{v=0}^{2u} [a_{u^2 + v}] = 2u^2 + (2u + 1)(u + 1) = 2u^2 + 2u^2 + 3u + 1 = 4u^2 + 3u + 1    ] 9. Therefore, for ( m ) in the range ( u^2 leq m < (u+1)^2 ):    [    sum_{m=u^2}^{(u+1)^2 - 1} [a_m] = 4u^2 + 3u + 1    ] 10.

Calculating the sum:     [     sum_{u=1}^{n-1} (4u^2 + 3u + 1) = 4 sum_{u=1}^{n-1} u^2 + 3 sum_{u=1}^{n-1} u + sum_{u=1}^{n-1} 1     ] 12. Using the formulas for the sums of squares and arithmetic series:     [     sum_{u=1}^{n-1} u^2 = frac{(n-1)n(2n-1)}{6}, quad sum_{u=1}^{n-1} u = frac{(n-1)n}{2}, quad sum_{u=1}^{n-1} 1 = n-1     ] 13. Substituting these into the sum:     [     4 cdot frac{(n-1)n(2n-1)}{6} + 3 cdot frac{(n-1)n}{2} + (n-1) = frac{4(n-1)n(2n-1)}{6} + frac{3(n-1)n}{2} + (n-1)     ] 14. Simplifying:     [     frac{8(n-1)n(2n-1)}{12} + frac{18(n-1)n}{12} + frac{12(n-1)}{12} = frac{8(n-1)n(2n-1) + 18(n-1)n + 12(n-1)}{12}     ] 15. Combining terms:     [     frac{8(n-1)n(2n-1) + 18(n-1)n + 12(n-1)}{12} = frac{8n^3 - 8n^2 + 16n^2 - 16n + 18n^2 - 18n + 12n - 12}{12}     ]     [     = frac{8n^3 + 26n^2 - 22n - 12}{12}     ] 16.

The intersection of A and B, denoted as A cap B, includes outcomes that are both even and not less than 3: A cap B = {4, 6} Next, we calculate the probabilities: - The probability of A, P(A), is the ratio of the number of favorable outcomes to the total number of outcomes in the sample space.

Given that 195=5times 39, we see that one of the factors, 5, is a single-digit number. This does not meet the criteria for an \\"excellent number\\" where both A and B must be two-digit numbers.

Next, we aim to find the maximum value of M that satisfies the condition for G(M) being divisible by 8. Let's denote the unit digit of A as n and the tens digit as m. Consequently, the unit digit of B will be 8-n, and its tens digit will also be m. Given that 0 < m leqslant 9 and 0 < n < 8, and both m and n are positive integers, we can express A and B as follows: - A = 10m + n - B = 10m + (8-n) Therefore, the sum of the units of A and B, P(M), can be calculated as: [P(M) = A + B = (10m + n) + (10m + 8 - n) = 20m + 8] And the absolute value of the difference between A and B, Q(M), is: [Q(M) = |A - B| = |(10m + n) - (10m + 8 - n)| = |2n - 8|] Assuming A geqslant B, which implies n geqslant 4, we restrict n to 4 leqslant n < 8.

Similarly, the topmost row of the ship can be in any of the first 516 rows of the chessboard. 2. **Placement of Detectors**:     - Place 515 detectors in the leftmost 515 columns on a selected middle row.     - Additionally, place another 515 detectors in the topmost 515 rows on a selected middle column.     - This translates into 1030 detectors in total, as visualized by choosing the middle row and middle column to cover maximal detection regions.  3. **Illustrate Coverage**:     - The strategy ensures that within each vertical sequence (from the first to the last) and within each horizontal sequence of columns and rows, there is at least one detector.     - Each vertical 1 times 1500 rectangle can be detected since part of it must reside within a row containing a detector, and the same logic applies to horizontal rectangles. 4. **Justification**:     - If Kolya places the ship covering some selected middle row, the detectors on that row can guarantee the knowledge about the left starting column of the ship.     - Simultaneously, the detectors on the selected middle column aid in identifying the topmost row placement of the ship.     - The construction ensures no matter how the ship is oriented within its limits, Dima will know its position guaranteed through the intersection of detected points. 5. **Proof of Optimality**:     - Considering arbitrary placement k detectors:       - Examine shifts (horizontal/vertical) by looking at pairs of positions a ship can take differing by 1 unit.       - Confirming each covered segment, each detector glass must be hit by a spanning middle inference and similarly vertical tracking confirms no gaps remain here. 6. **Graphical Illustration**:     - The provided figure confirms the separation into designated regions, ensuring coverage addressing 1030 depicted strategically as pairs of intersection.     - Subdivide the board into requisite areas ensuring all parts marked confirm pair-wise points ensuring optimal use of detectors. 7. **Finality**:     - Hence confirming that the minimum number of detectors k ensuring each positioning determined.

Assume ( P ) does not contain at least 2 black triangles. Since ( k+1 geq 5 ), ( P ) has at least 5 sides. Only 2 of these sides can belong to black triangles, otherwise, we would have at least 2 black triangles, contradicting our assumption.

By the lemma, ( P ) contains at least 2 black triangles. Remove one black triangle ( D ), leaving a triangulated ( n )-gon ( P' ). The triangles in ( P' ) retain their colors except for the triangle ( D' ) adjacent to ( D ). If ( D' ) was red, it becomes black; if ( D' ) was white, it becomes red.

Let's select these diameters such that they are not parallel and form an angle theta on both the top and bottom bases.  3. **Form the Tetrahedron:**    Now, \\"flatten\\" the cylinder along these diameters. If the angle theta isn't too large, you can visualize this process as pulling the bases tight along these diameters, resulting in a shape that approximates a tetrahedron. Specifically, the vertices of the tetrahedron can be identified at the ends of the diameters (four points in total), two on the top base and two on the bottom base, forming the four vertices of a tetrahedron. 4. **Variation of Different Tetrahedra:**    By changing the angle theta between the selected diameters on the top and bottom bases, you can generate different shapes of tetrahedra. Varying theta will change the relative positions of the vertices and thus the angles and edge lengths of the tetrahedron.

Thus, one solution is a = 3 and b = -4. 2. If a = -3, there is no value of b that is less than -3 and satisfies |b| = 4, so this case is not possible. For the case where a = 3 and b = -4, we calculate a - b: a - b = 3 - (-4) = 3 + 4 = 7. Therefore, the value of a - b is boxed{7}. There is no valid case for the value 1, as the condition a > b only holds true for a = 3 and b = -4, leading to a single valid answer."},{"instruction":"Let (ABC) be a scalene triangle with circumcircle (Gamma).

Let (N) be the radical center of the circumcircles of triangles (ABC), (BMP), and (CMP). The pairwise radical axes of these circles are (BD), (CE), and (PM), and hence they concur at (N). 2. Observe the angles:    [    angle MCE = angle MPE = angle MPY = angle MBY.    ]     3. This implies that (BY) is parallel to (CE), and analogously, (CX) is parallel to (BD). 4. Let (L) be the intersection of (BY) and (CX). It follows that the quadrilateral (BNC L) is a parallelogram. Since (BM = MC), we deduce that (L) is the reflection of (N) with respect to (M), and therefore (L in AM). 5. Using the power of a point from (L) to the circumcircles of triangles (BMP) and (CMP), we have:    [    LY cdot LB = LP cdot LM = LX cdot LC.    ] 6. Hence, (BYXC) is cyclic. Using the cyclic quadrilateral, in directed angles, we find:    [    angle LXY = angle LBC = angle BCN = angle NDE.    ] 7. Since (CX parallel BN), it follows that (XY parallel DE). 8. Let (Q) and (R) be two points on (Gamma) such that (CQ), (BR), and (AM) are all parallel. Then in directed angles, we have:    [    angle QDB = angle QCB = angle AMB = angle PMB = angle PDB.    ] 9. Therefore, (D, P, Q) are collinear. Similarly, (E, P, R) are collinear.  10. From here, we get:     [     angle PRQ = angle PDE = angle PXY,     ]     since (XY) and (DE) are parallel. Thus, (QRYX) is cyclic. 11. Let (S) be the radical center of the circumcircle of triangle (ABC) and the circles (BCYX) and (QRYX). This point lies on the lines (BC), (QR), and (XY) because these are the radical axes of the circles. 12. Let (T) be the second intersection of (AS) with (Gamma). By applying the power of a point from (S) to the circumcircle of (ABC) and the circle (BCXY), we obtain:     [     SX cdot SY = SB cdot SC = ST cdot SA.     ] 13. Therefore, (T) lies on the circumcircle of triangle (AXY). Since (Q) and (R) are fixed regardless of the choice of (P), then (S) is also fixed as it is the intersection of (QR) and (BC). Hence, (T) is also fixed, and therefore, the circumcircle of triangle (AXY) passes through (T neq A) for any choice of (P). 14. This concludes the proof.

Switching the digits gives 10b + a. We know 10b + a is between 82 and 86. 4. **Set up the equation and solve for possible values of x**:    - Since 10b + a must be between 82 and 86, we consider each case:      - If 10b + a = 82, then reversing gives 10a + b = 28. Solving 5x + 13 = 28 gives 5x = 15, so x = 3. This is not a two-digit number, so it's invalid.      - If 10b + a = 83, then reversing gives 10a + b = 38. Solving 5x + 13 = 38 gives 5x = 25, so x = 5. This is not a two-digit number, so it's invalid.      - If 10b + a = 84, then reversing gives 10a + b = 48. Solving 5x + 13 = 48 gives 5x = 35, so x = 7. This is not a two-digit number, so it's invalid.      - If 10b + a = 85, then reversing gives 10a + b = 58. Solving 5x + 13 = 58 gives 5x = 45, so x = 9.

For instance, in a cube ABCD-A_{1}B_{1}C_{1}D_{1}, overrightarrow{AB}=overrightarrow{{A}_{1}{B}_{1}} in terms of magnitude and direction, but AB and A_{1}B_{1} do not coincide in space. - **Proposition ②**: It claims that if overrightarrow{a}•overrightarrow{b}＜0, then 〈overrightarrow{a},overrightarrow{b}〉 forms an obtuse angle.

We need to show that the geometric locus of points dividing the segments A_i B_i (for i = 1, 2, 3, ldots, n) in equal ratios is either a line or a point. 4. Consider the properties of the ratios given. If we denote the common ratio as k, we have:    [    frac{A_{i}A_{i+1}}{B_{i}B_{i+1}} = k    ]    for all i = 1, 2, 3, ldots, n-1. 5. This can be rewritten as:    [    A_{i}A_{i+1} = k cdot B_{i}B_{i+1}    ] 6. Examining the configuration of the quadrilaterals A_{i}A_{i+2}B_{i+2}B_{i}, by properties of parallel and proportional lines in a coordinate plane, we can establish that corresponding segments are similarly proportionally divided. 7. According to the result from Problem No. 248, this condition means that the locus of points that divide each segment A_i B_i in the same ratio lies on a straight line. This is based on the fundamental property of similar triangles and consistency in the ratio of corresponding segments. 8. Hence, since all segments A_i B_i (for i = 1, 2, ldots, n) are divided in identical ratios, the intersection of such points must lie on a straight line or potentially converge to a single point (if all A_i and B_i are collinear in certain configurations). # Conclusion: [ boxed{text{The geometric locus of points dividing the segments A_{i} B_{i} in equal ratios is either a straight line or a point.}} ]"},{"instruction":"Shift the graph of the function y=sin(x frac{pi}{4}) to the right by frac{pi}{2} units to obtain the graph of the function y=sin(x+theta) (0 leq theta < 2pi).

According to the problem, the initial solution is made up of 88% water, 8% concentrated kola, and the rest is sugar. This means that the initial amount of sugar in the solution is (100% - 88% - 8%) = 4% of V. Now, after adding 3.2 liters of sugar, 10 liters of water, and 6.8 liters of concentrated kola, the new volume of the solution becomes (V + 3.2 + 10 + 6.8) liters. The new amount of sugar in the solution is (4% of V + 3.2) liters, because we added 3.2 liters of sugar to the initial amount. According to the problem, after the addition, sugar makes up 4.521739130434784% of the new solution.

To find B's work rate, we subtract A's work rate from the combined work rate of A and B: B's work rate = ( frac{1}{12} - frac{1}{20} ) To find a common denominator, we can use 60 (the least common multiple of 12 and 20): B's work rate = ( frac{5}{60} - frac{3}{60} ) B's work rate = ( frac{2}{60} ) B's work rate = ( frac{1}{30} ) of the work per day. This means B alone can also finish the work in 30 days, which is the same as C's work rate. Now, let's find out how much work is done by A, B, and C together in the first 5 days. The combined work rate of A, B, and C is: A's rate + B's rate + C's rate = ( frac{1}{20} + frac{1}{30} + frac{1}{30} ) To find a common denominator, we can use 60: Combined work rate = ( frac{3}{60} + frac{2}{60} + frac{2}{60} ) Combined work rate = ( frac{7}{60} ) of the work per day. In 5 days, they will complete: ( 5 times frac{7}{60} = frac{35}{60} ) of the work. This means that ( frac{35}{60} ) of the work is done, and ( 1 - frac{35}{60} = frac{25}{60} ) of the work is left. Now, B will complete the remaining ( frac{25}{60} ) of the work alone.

Because the circle C is tangent to the line x+y=0, the distance d from the center to the line should be equal to the radius r=sqrt{2}.

Setting that equal to the radius: [ frac{|a|}{sqrt{2}}=sqrt{2}. ] Multiplying both sides by sqrt{2}, we get: [ |a| = 2. ] Since a must be positive (as the circle lies to the right of the y-axis), we take the positive solution, thus a=2.

In this case, we can rearrange the equation to y = -x + 1. Hence, the slope m=-1. Now, we can find the angle of inclination α. Since the slope of the line is the tangent of its angle of inclination, we have m=tan(alpha). Here m=-1, so alpha = arctan(-1). The angle, which corresponds to m=-1 on the unit circle, lies in the second quadrant, because a positively sloped line makes an angle less than 90^{circ} with the positive direction of the x-axis, and a negatively sloped line goes beyond 90^{circ}. Hence, alpha=180^{circ} - 45^{circ} = 135^{circ}. Next, to find the equation of the line that passes through the point (1,1) and is parallel to the line l, we use the point-slope form of the equation of a line (y - y_1) = m(x - x_1), where m is the slope and (x_1, y_1) is a point on the line. Since line l has a slope of -1, the parallel line will have the same slope.

If necessary, round the answer to 0.01 or write the answer as an ordinary fraction.","output":"1. Let's consider the line segment PQ. The length of PQ is given as 73. 2. The problem states that PQ is divided into several smaller segments, and a square is constructed on each of these smaller segments. Each square will add to the total path length by making us traverse along three sides of the square instead of just following the original segment. 3. To understand why this increases the path length by three times, imagine the process of walking along each small segment forming PQ. Instead of moving directly along the segment (which would be the shortest path), we now follow the path along three sides of the squares constructed on each segment. This means that for every small segment of length ( Delta l ), the path we follow is:    [    text{Path length for each segment} = 3 times Delta l    ] 4. Since this principle applies uniformly along the entirety of PQ, the total increased path length can be calculated by multiplying the total length of PQ (which is 73) by 3:    [    text{Total path length} = 3 times 73    ] 5.

Thus, k geqslant e - 2. Now let's consider the function v(x)= frac{(x+1)(ln x+1)}{x}. We need to find the maximum value of v(x) on the interval [1,e] to obtain the upper bound for k. Taking the derivative of v(x), we get: v'(x) = frac{x - ln x}{x^{2}} Let's set u(x) = x - ln x and find its derivative: u'(x) = 1 - frac{1}{x} Since u'(x) geqslant 0 for all x in [1,e], u(x) is an increasing function on this interval. Therefore, u(x) geqslant u(1) = 1 which implies that v'(x) = frac{x - ln x}{x^{2}} geqslant 0 always holds. Because v(x) is increasing on [1,e], we have v(x) geqslant v(1) = 2. Hence, k leqslant 2.

Now, we can use the law of cosines to find the length of the third side. The law of cosines states that in any triangle, the square of the length of one side is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides minus twice their product times the cosine of the included angle.

First, divide both sides of the equation by asin A to obtain sin Asin B+frac{b}{a}cos ^{2}A=2. Next, using the sine rule, we have frac{a}{sin A} = frac{b}{sin B}, so we can substitute frac{b}{a} with frac{sin B}{sin A} to get sin Asin B+sin Bcot ^{2}A=2. Now, using the identity csc^{2}A = 1 + cot^{2}A, we can rewrite the equation as sin B(1+sin^{2} A)=2sin A. Since 0 < A < pi, we know that sin A > 0, so we can divide both sides by sin A to get sin B = 2sin A - sin^{3} A. Now, we want to maximize angle A. Since sin B is a function of A, we can instead find the maximum value of sin B. To do this, we take the derivative of sin B with respect to A and set it equal to zero: frac{d}{dA}(sin B) = 2cos A - 3sin^{2}Acos A = 0. Solving for A, we find that cos A = frac{2}{sqrt{3}} or cos A = -frac{1}{sqrt{3}}. However, since 0 < A < pi, we know that cos A cannot be negative, so we discard the second solution.

Among any 12 balls, there is at least one white ball. 3. Among any 20 balls, there is at least one black ball. We can set up the following equations: [ W + B = 30 ]  Step 1: Analyze the second condition: Among any 20 balls, there must be at least one black ball. If there were fewer than 11 black balls, then we could choose 20 balls containing no black balls, which would contradict the second condition. Therefore: [ B geq 11 ]  Step 2: Analyze the first condition: Among any 12 balls, there must be at least one white ball. If there were fewer than 11 white balls, then we could choose 12 balls containing no white balls, which would contradict the first condition. Therefore: [ W geq 11 ] Now, from the fact that ( W + B = 30 ), we combine the constraints: [ W + B = 30 ] [ W geq 11 ] [ B geq 11 ]  Step 3: Determine the exact number of white balls: Since the minimum number of white and black balls is 11 each, let's explore the values in this range.

Given:     - Digits 1 through 9 are arranged in a circle in an arbitrary order.    - Each set of three consecutive digits in the clockwise direction forms a three-digit number.    - We need to find the sum of all such possible nine three-digit numbers and determine if it depends on the order of the digits. 2. Understanding the problem:    - Each of the nine digits appears exactly once in each position: hundreds, tens, and units place across the three-digit numbers generated.    - For instance, if we consider the sequence of digits (a, b, c):      - The three-digit number is given by (100a + 10b + c). 3. Counting appearances in each place:    - Since there are 9 different numbers and each number appears once at each digit placement across the cycle, we can understand the impact on the final sum:      - Each digit appears once in the hundreds place, once in the tens place, and once in the units place. 4.

Since digits (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_9) are just permutations of (1, 2, ldots, 9), the sum of any permutation of these digits is equal to the sum of the first 9 natural numbers:    [    sum_{i=1}^{9} i = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 = 45    ] 7.

Otherwise, for aneq 2, the sequence will have infinitely many values due to the geometric progression component. **Final Answers:** - When a=1, a_{10}=boxed{frac{63}{16}}. - The values of all real numbers a that satisfy the condition for the sequence to take only a finite number of different values are boxed{2}."},{"instruction":"There are 8 unique positive odd integers less than a certain number that are equal to the product of a positive multiple of 5 and an odd number.

The second skier continues to travel until the 27 km mark and then turns back. The first skier continues travelling and reaches the point where they meet the second skier, which is 2 km from the turning point. Hence, from the turning point back 2 km, the second skier meets the first skier.  5. Let's analyze this situation in terms of time. By the time they meet, the second skier has travelled:    [    frac{27}{y} text{ (forward)} + frac{2}{y} text{ (backward)}    ] 6. The first skier has taken an extra 9 minutes to start, and travels a full 25 km during this time, so the time equation becomes:    [    frac{29}{y} + 9 = frac{25}{x}    ] 7. We now have two equations:    [    frac{9}{y} + 9 = frac{9}{x}    ]    [    frac{29}{y} + 9 = frac{25}{x}    ] 8. Subtracting the first equation from the second equation, we get:    [    frac{29}{y} + 9 - left( frac{9}{y} + 9 right) = frac{25}{x} - frac{9}{x}    ]    [    frac{29 - 9}{y} = frac{25 - 9}{x}    ]    [    frac{20}{y} = frac{16}{x}    ] 9. From the above, we can express (x) in terms of (y):    [    x = frac{4}{5} y    ] 10. Substitute ( x ) back into the first equation:     [     frac{9}{y} + 9 = frac{9}{frac{4}{5} y}     ]     [     frac{9}{y} + 9 = frac{9 times 5}{4y}     ]     [     frac{9}{y} + 9 = frac{45}{4y}     ] 11.

Each entry in Pascal's triangle is the sum of the two directly above it. Larger numbers start appearing more frequently as we go further down. A practical approach would involve analyzing the values along the diagonals or specific rows because numbers in Pascal's triangle along a row increase toward the middle and then decrease symmetrically. The largest three-digit number is likely located toward the diagonal edges of the row where the numbers start becoming four digits. **Observation:** Within the initial rows of Pascal's triangle (specifically, looking up to around the 15th row), numbers like 120, 210, etc., appear, which are beyond 100 but less than 999. Further exploration into the triangle, particularly in the rows around the early twenties, yields numbers like 495, 792, and so on, which are within the three-digit range but increasing. The 30th row, noticeably, has numbers well into the thousands sector. **Conclusion:** The largest three-digit numbers would be towards the end of the rows just before four-digit numbers begin.

The equation xln x - ax^{2} = 0 simplifies to ln x - ax = 0 because we can divide both sides by x (assuming x neq 0). 2. This equation can be rewritten as a = frac{ln x}{x}. We define a new function g(x) = frac{ln x}{x}. 3. To find where g(x) is increasing or decreasing, we compute its derivative: g'(x) = frac{1 - ln x}{x^2}. 4. By setting g'(x) > 0, we find that the function is increasing when 0 < x < e and decreasing when x > e. 5. Evaluating g(x) at notable points, we find g(e) = frac{1}{e} and g(1) = 0.

Hence, the range of a is boxed{(0, frac{1}{e})}. **Part (2): Proving the inequality frac{x_{1}}{e} > left(frac{e}{x_{2}}right)^{lambda}** Given g(x) = f(x) - x + a has two distinct extreme points x_{1} and x_{2}, we proceed as follows: 1. The condition for extreme points is g'(x) = f'(x) - 1 = ln x - 2ax = 0, which implies that x_{1} and x_{2} are solutions to this equation. 2. From g'(x) = 0, we have ln x_{1} = 2ax_{1} and ln x_{2} = 2ax_{2}. 3. This leads to lnfrac{x_1}{x_2} = 2a(x_{1} - x_{2}), and thus 2a = frac{lnfrac{x_{1}}{x_{2}}}{x_{1} - x_{2}}. 4. Let t = frac{x_1}{x_2}, where t in (0, 1) due to x_{1} < x_{2}. We aim to prove frac{x_{1}}{e} > left(frac{e}{x_{2}}right)^{lambda}. 5. This inequality simplifies to e^{1+lambda} < x_1 cdot x_2^{lambda}, which further simplifies to 1 + lambda < ln x_{1} + lambda ln x_{2}. 6. Substituting ln x_{1} = 2ax_{1} and ln x_{2} = 2ax_{2}, we get 1 + lambda < 2a(x_{1} + lambda x_{2}). 7.

If ( a_i neq n ), then among the numbers there will be a pair. If ( a_i = n ), then we need to prove that there will be a sum without ( a_i ) that is divisible by ( n ). This sum or this sum plus ( a_i ) will be divisible by ( 2n ). 3. **Proof of the Last Assertion:**    We need to prove that among any ( n-1 ) numbers from the set ( {1, 2, ldots, n-1, n+1, ldots, 2n-1} ), we can find some with a sum divisible by ( n ). 4. **Indexing and Modulo ( n ):**    Index the numbers such that ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{n-1} ) are distinct modulo ( n ).

If among the numbers ( a_1, a_2, a_1 + a_2, ldots, a_1 + cdots + a_{n-1} ), there exists a pair of numbers that are equal modulo ( n ), then their difference will be ( 0 ) modulo ( n ), and thus will be a sum of numbers because ( a_1 - a_2 ) is not ( 0 ) modulo ( n ). 5. **Distinct Residues Modulo ( n ):**    Otherwise, it forms a system of distinct residues modulo ( n ), so one of them will be ( 0 ) modulo ( n ). 6. **Conclusion:**    Therefore, there exists a subset of the set ( {a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n } ) such that the sum of its elements is divisible by ( 2n ).

However, since there are three distinct zeros, and they cannot all be symmetric around x = 1 without one of them being x = 1 itself (because for any two points symmetric around x = 1, one must be to the left and the other to the right of x = 1), it follows that one of the zeros must be x = 1.  Let's assume b = 1. Then, considering the symmetry, a and c must be such that 1-a = 3+c or 1-c = 3+a. Solving either equation gives us the relationship between a and c that ensures the symmetry of the function around x = 1. Given this, the sum of the zeros a + b + c simplifies to a + 1 + c.

However, considering a special case where b = 0 leads us to 0 = 0, which does not satisfy ab > bc. Thus, this statement cannot universally hold. **B: a|c| > b|c|** Similarly, given a > b and multiplying both sides by |c|, a non-negative value, should preserve the inequality if |c| > 0.

The base of the logarithm must not be 1 to prevent the natural logarithm from being 0, which would make the denominator of the fraction zero: x + 1 neq 1, simplifying to x neq 0. 3. The expression inside the square root must be non-negative: 4 - x^2 geq 0, which leads to the inequality -2 leq x leq 2 after factoring or completing the square. Combining these conditions: - From the first condition, x must be greater than -1. - From the second condition, x must not equal 0. - From the third condition, x must be less than or equal to 2, giving us a further restriction on the domain.

The second digit (hours units place):     - If the first digit is 0 or 1, it can be any digit from 0 to 9.    - If the first digit is 2, it can only be 0, 1, 2, or 3. 3. The third digit (minutes tens place): This can be any digit from 0 to 5. 4. The fourth digit (minutes units place): This can be any digit from 0 to 9. We are interested in the case where all digits are even numbers (0, 2, 4, 6, 8): 1. **Case 1: First digit is 0 or 1 (which leaves the range for the second digit wide)**:    - First digit = 0:      - Second digit (0-9 but we only care about evens) = {0, 2, 4, 6, 8}      - Third digit (0-5) = {0, 2, 4}      - Fourth digit (0-9) = {0, 2, 4, 6, 8}    - Number of combinations: (1 times 5 times 3 times 5 = 75) 2. **Case 2: First digit equals 2**:    - First digit = 2:      - Second digit = {0, 2}      - Third digit = {0, 2, 4}      - Fourth digit = {0, 2, 4, 6, 8}    - Number of combinations: (1 times 2 times 3 times 5 = 30) Adding both cases together, we get: [ 75 + 30 = 105 ] **Conclusion**: [ boxed{105} ] **(b)** A clock rings (\\"plim\\") every time one of its hands passes another.

Divide the larger number by the smaller number and find the remainder:    2030 ÷ 1647 = 1 with a remainder of 383. 2. Replace the larger number with the smaller number and the smaller number with the remainder from the previous step:    Now we need to find the GCD of 1647 and 383. 3. Repeat the process:    1647 ÷ 383 = 4 with a remainder of 115.    383 ÷ 115 = 3 with a remainder of 38.    115 ÷ 38 = 3 with a remainder of 1. 4. Continue until the remainder is 0. The last non-zero remainder is the GCD:    38 ÷ 1 = 38 with a remainder of 0. The GCD of 1647 and 2030 is 1.

Let the angle bisectors of the external angles at vertices ( B ) and ( C ) of the trapezoid ( ABCD ) (where ( BC parallel AD )) intersect at point ( P ), and let the angle bisectors of the external angles at vertices ( A ) and ( D ) intersect at point ( Q ). 2. Denote the points where the lines ( PB ) and ( PC ) intersect the line ( AD ) by ( E ) and ( F ) respectively. 3. Within the trapezoid ( ABCD ), triangles ( BAE ) and ( CDF ) are isosceles due to the symmetry of the angle bisectors. 4. Let ( X ) be the midpoint of segment ( BE ), and ( Y ) be the midpoint of ( CF ). Hence, ( X ) and ( Y ) are the midpoints of isosceles triangles, ensuring ( BE = EC ) and ( CF = FD ). 5. Consequently, ( XY parallel EF ) is established. 6. We also have that (angle PXQ = angle PYQ = 90^circ ). This means that points ( X ) and ( Y ) lie on a circle with diameter ( PQ ), making the inscribed angles ( angle XPQ ) and ( angle XYQ ) subtend the same arc. 7. We can write (angle XDQ = angle XPQ = angle XYQ), since inscribed angles subtending the same arc are equal. 8. This equality allows us to infer (angle EDQ = angle EPQ). 9. Both points ( P ) and ( D ) share the same view of ( EQ ) indicating a cyclic quadrilateral formation where ( E, P, Q, ) and ( D ) lie on the same circle. 10.

Next, let’s verify that the sum of any number of these numbers ( ( > 1 ) ) is composite:    - Consider any ( k ) of these numbers: ( a_{i1}, a_{i2}, ldots, a_{ik} ).    - Their sum can be written as:      [      a_{i1} + a_{i2} + cdots + a_{ik} = i1 cdot n! + 1 + i2 cdot n! + 1 + cdots + ik cdot n! + 1      ]      [      = (i1 + i2 + cdots + ik) cdot n! + k      ]    - Since ( k geq 2 ), and ((i1 + i2 + cdots + ik) cdot n!) is clearly divisible by ( k ), the resulting sum ( (i1 + i2 + cdots + ik) cdot n! + k ) is a composite number because it is divisible by ( k ), confirming the second condition. 6.

Test values from each interval in the inequality frac{x+7}{x-2} lt 0 to determine where the inequality holds:    - For x in (-infty, -7), choose x = -8: frac{-8+7}{-8-2} = frac{-1}{-10} > 0, so this interval does not satisfy the inequality.    - For x in (-7, 2), choose x = 0: frac{0+7}{0-2} = frac{7}{-2} < 0, so this interval satisfies the inequality.    - For x in (2, infty), choose x = 3: frac{3+7}{3-2} = frac{10}{1} > 0, so this interval does not satisfy the inequality.

Show that its vertices can be partitioned into two sets, each with size  k , such that the edges between vertices of the same set do not determine any  3 cycles. *Calvin Deng.*","output":"To solve the problem, we need to show that a tournament on (2k) vertices that contains no 7-cycles can be partitioned into two sets, each of size (k), such that the edges between vertices of the same set do not form any 3-cycles. We will use the following steps: 1. **Lemma 1:**    A tournament (T) that is not strongly connected can be partitioned into two non-empty subgraphs (A) and (B) such that all the edges between (A) and (B) are directed from (A) to (B). 2. **Lemma 2:**    A tournament (T) with (n) vertices is strongly connected, so we can find a cycle of length (k) in (T) for all (3 leq k leq n). 3. **Partitioning into Strongly Connected Subgraphs:**    Using Lemma 1, we can partition (T) into strongly connected subgraphs (A_i) (equivalently, (A_i) that contain full cycles) for (i = 1, 2, ldots, m) such that whenever (i < j), all edges between (A_i) and (A_j) are directed toward (A_j). 4. **Bounding the Size of Subgraphs:**    Since (T) contains no 7-cycles, we can show that (|A_i| leq 6) for all (i). This is because if any (A_i) had more than 6 vertices, it would contain a 7-cycle, contradicting the given condition. 5. **Partitioning Small Tournaments:**    It suffices to show that every strongly connected tournament (G) with (n leq 6) vertices can be partitioned into two transitive sub-tournaments of size (lfloor n/2 rfloor) and (lceil n/2 rceil). 6. **Verification for Small (n):**    - For (n leq 4), it is straightforward to verify that such a partition exists.    - For (n = 5), a counterexample would require every partition to have at least one triangle, implying at least (binom{5}{3} = 10) triangles in total.    - For (n = 6), a counterexample would require every partition to have at least one triangle, implying at least (frac{1}{2} binom{6}{3} = 10) triangles in all. 7. **Counting Triangles:**    Using Jensen's inequality, we can show that there are (binom{n}{3} - sum_{v in G} binom{d(v)}{2} leq binom{n}{3} - n binom{binom{n}{2}/n}{2}) triangles in (G). This computation confirms that the number of triangles is less than required for a counterexample. 8. **Conclusion:**    Since we can partition (T) into strongly connected subgraphs of size at most 6, and each of these subgraphs can be partitioned into two transitive sub-tournaments, we can partition the original tournament (T) into two sets of size (k) such that the edges within each set do not form any 3-cycles.

These points are therefore inside the figure bounded by the curve ( K ). 2. **Construct Circles:**    Draw circles of radius ( r ) centered at points ( A ) and ( B ). These circles do not extend beyond the boundary of the ( r )-neighborhood of ( K ). 3. **Consider Properties of the ( r )-Neighborhood:**    Since the circles of radius ( r ) are completely inside the figure bounded by ( K ), it means no point of the curve ( K ) lies strictly inside either circle. If there were a point ( P ) of the curve ( K ) lying inside the circle centered at ( A ), then the distance ( PA ) would be less than ( r ). This would imply that point ( A ) lies within an ( r )-neighborhood of ( P ) and therefore must lie within the ( r )-neighborhood of ( K ), which is a contradiction. 4. **Identify External Tangent Properties:**    By external tangents, we mean straight-line segments tangent to the circles centered at ( A ) and ( B ) at points outside the circles themselves. The external tangents between the circles of radius ( r ) centered at ( A ) and ( B ) are such that the segments connecting the points of tangency lie inside the ( r )-neighborhood of ( K ). 5. **Examine Connectivity within the Neighborhood:**    Since both circles lie entirely within the ( r )-neighborhood and considering polygonal properties, any line segment connecting points within these circles must also lie within the ( r )-neighborhood of the convex curve ( K ). 6. **Select Intermediate Points:**    For any intermediate point ( C ) on the line segment ( AB ), the circle of radius ( r ) centered at ( C ) also lies within the figure bounded by the internal curve of the ( r )-neighborhood around ( K ). 7. **Complete the Convexity Argument:**    Since the entire line segment ( AB ) (chosen arbitrarily) lies inside the internal curve bounding the ( r )-neighborhood, and considering the fact that no point within the segment ( AB ) leaves the boundary, the curve inside the ( r )-neighborhood is convex. **Conclusion:** Therefore, the internal curve bounding the ( r )-neighborhood of a convex curve ( K ) is indeed convex. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"an election between two candidates  Lange and Sobel  70% of the voters voted for Sobel.

For the difference between the largest and smallest of these numbers to be as large as possible, we would like one of the numbers to be as small as possible, which in this case is 1 (since it must be a whole number greater than zero). Considering one of the numbers is 1 and another is 3 (as per the new condition for the second smallest number), the sum of the remaining three numbers is 30 - 1 - 3 = 26.

Justify the answer.","output":"To determine if there exists any power of 2 which, when written in the decimal system, has all its digits different from zero and can be rearranged to form another power of 2, we need to analyze a few conditions systematically. Let's go through the detailed reasoning step by step: 1. **Digits and Number of Digits Condition**:        For two numbers to be rearrangements of one another, they must contain the exact same digits and consequently, must have the same number of digits. Let's denote two such powers of 2 by (2^a) and (2^b). Since these are rearrangements, the two numbers must have the same set of digits.        From the properties of numbers, when we double a number multiple times, the total number of digits can increase. Specifically, if we consider     [    2^a = x quad text{and} quad 2^b = y    ]    If (b > a), then:    [    y = 2^{(b-a)} cdot x    ]    For (x) and (y) to have the same number of digits,        [    2^{(b-a)} cdot x quad text{must not introduce new digits}quad.    ]        Hence, the quotient (frac{2^b}{2^a} = 2^{(b-a)} ) should be at most around 8 (because multiplying by 10 would change the number of digits). If it were exactly 16 (or higher), it would increase the number of digits.     2. **Sum of the Digits Condition**:        For two numbers to be rearrangements of each other, the sum of their digits must also be the same. Let's denote the sum of digits for (2^a) by (y). Then the sum of the digits of (2^b) also must be (y), considering they are permutations.        When a number is doubled:        [    text{New Sum of Digits} = 2y - 9x    ]    where (x) is the number of carry-overs required in the addition process. For (y) to remain the same after being doubled, we must have:        [    2y - 9x = y    implies y = 9x    ] 3. **Divisibility Condition**:        For the equality (y = 9x) to hold true (make (y) constant), (y) must be a multiple of 9. According to the divisibility rule, if the sum of the digits of a number is a multiple of 9, then the number itself is a multiple of 9.        However, powers of 2 are never multiples of 9 (except in trivial cases not part of our consideration), thus violating the condition that (y) must be a multiple of 9. 4. **Generalization to Higher Powers**:    - **For Multiple Orders**:            - **Check for 4**:        When doubling twice:                [        2(2y - 9x) - 9z = 0 implies 4y - 18x - 9z = 0 implies quad 4y = 9(2x + z)        ]        Similar reasoning indicates inconsistency because (2x + z) must be an integer.            - **Check for 8**:        When doubling three times:              [        2(4y - 18x - 9z) - 9w = 0 implies 8y - 36x - 18z - 9w = 0 implies 8y = 9(4x + 2z + w)        ]        Here as well (4x + 2z + w) must be an integer. Thus with such derived arguments and shown steps, it becomes evident that it remains impossible to find such numbers, balancing all outlined constraints and properties. # Conclusion: [ boxed{text{There does not exist any such power of 2 satisfying both described reordering conditions.}} ]"},{"instruction":"the given diagram, let P be a point on the circumcircle of triangle ABC.

She worked 26 hours, so she was paid for 15 hours at her regular rate (x dollars per hour) and 11 hours at her overtime rate (2x dollars per hour). Olivia's pay = 15x + 2x(11) = 15x + 22x = 37x We know that Harry and James were paid the same amount, so Harry's pay is also 42x. The total amount paid to Harry, James, and Olivia last week was 5000, so we can write the equation: Harry's pay + James's pay + Olivia's pay = Total pay 42x + 42x + 37x = 5000 121x = 5000 x = 5000 / 121 x ≈ 41.32 Now that we have the value of x, we can calculate the number of hours Harry worked.

Is it true that the sum of all the numbers is positive?","output":":  1. **Identifiers and Definitions:**    Given a sequence of 25 numbers, we are asked to evaluate the assertion that no matter which three numbers we pick, there exists a fourth number amongst the remaining ones such that the sum of these four numbers is positive. We are also tasked to determine if this implies that the sum of all 25 numbers must be positive. 2. **Constructing a Specific Example:**    Let's construct a specific example to evaluate the assertion. Consider the following set:    [    { -1, -1, -1, ldots, -1, -1, 5 }    ]    where there are 24 instances of (-1) and one instance of (5). 3. **Verification of Condition:**    - Suppose we select any three numbers from this set. There are two cases to consider:      - **Case 1:** If among the selected three numbers we have the (5), their sum would already be (-1 + -1 + 5 = 3) which is positive.      - **Case 2:** If the selected three numbers are all (-1), i.e., ( -1 + -1 + -1 = -3 ). Here, the remaining numbers contain the number (5) which when added results in:        [        -3 + 5 = 2        ]        Thus, the sum in this case would also be positive.    Therefore, for any three chosen numbers, there always exists a fourth number from the remainder that can make the sum of these four numbers positive. 4. **Sum of All Numbers:**    - Now, let's calculate the sum of all these 25 numbers:    [    sum_{i=1}^{24} (-1) + 5 = 24 cdot (-1) + 5 = -24 + 5 = -19    ]    Thus, the sum of all 25 numbers in this specific example is (-19), which is negative. # Conclusion: This shows that it is possible for the sum of all 25 numbers to be negative while still ensuring the condition that for any three chosen numbers, there exists another such that the sum of the four is positive.

Construct an equilateral triangle (BCL) such that points (A) and (L) lie on the same side of (BC). 2. Note that points (A), (C), and (L) lie on a circle with radius (BA) and center point (B). 3. Since (K) lies inside the triangle (ABC), the angle (angle ABC) is greater than (60^circ), implying that points (L) and (B) lie on opposite sides of (AC) with (L) on the smaller arc of (AC). 4. Therefore, the inscribed angle (angle CAL) is half of the central angle (angle CBL), making (angle CAL = 30^circ). From Symmetry: - Since (K) is the unique point satisfying the given conditions, it must coincide with point (L) symmetrical to (A) about side (AC). - Consequently, triangle (AKL) must be equilateral and point (K), just like point (B), lies on the perpendicular bisector of segment (AL). 5.

Within the interval (0, frac{pi}{2}), sin x is increasing, and thus |sin x| is also increasing. Therefore, A satisfies both conditions. - For function B, y = |sin 2x|: The sine function with a doubled argument 2x oscillates more frequently, meaning it will have both positive and negative values in the interval (0, frac{pi}{2}). After taking the absolute value, the function will not be strictly increasing across the entire interval, thus excluding B. - For function C, y = |cos x|: The cosine function decreases from 1 to 0 in the interval (0, frac{pi}{2}).

Let's assume that A invested in a stock with a face value of 100 (this is a common practice to assume for simplicity unless given otherwise). Since it's a 10% stock, A receives 10 per year (10% of 100). Now, B wants to invest in a 12% stock and wants to receive the same income as A. To find out how much B needs to invest to get the same 10 income, we can set up the following equation: 12% of B's investment = 10 0.12 * B's investment = 10 B's investment = 10 / 0.12 B's investment = 83.33 This means that B would need to invest 83.33 in the 12% stock to receive 10 in income, which is the same as A's income from the 10% stock. However, we are given that B must purchase a stock worth 115.2. This means that the actual market price of the 12% stock is higher than its face value. To find the actual price that B pays for the stock, we can use the following proportion: Face value / Market price = B's investment / 115.2 100 / Market price = 83.33 / 115.2 Now we can solve for the market price: Market price = (100 * 115.2) / 83.33 Market price = 11520 / 83.33 Market price = 138.24 So, the price of the stock A invested in (the 10% stock) is boxed{138.24} .

We are given an equilateral triangle and an arbitrary line in its plane.

Without loss of generality, let us place the directrix through one of the triangle's vertices. This simplifies the problem without affecting the generality of our solution. 3. Assume the line intersects the triangle at one of its vertices and let this vertex be ( A ). Let the triangle have vertices ( A, B, C ) and sides ( AB, BC, CA ). The line forms an angle ( varphi ) with side ( AB ). 4. If the directrix forms an angle ( varphi ) with side ( AB ), it will form angles of ( 60^circ + varphi ) with ( BC ) and ( 60^circ - varphi ) with ( CA ) due to the properties of equilateral triangles (each interior angle is ( 60^circ )). 5. The perpendicular distances from the vertices to the line can be expressed using the sine function:     - The distance ( n ) from vertex ( B ) to the line is ( n = a sin(varphi) )     - The distance ( p ) from vertex ( C ) to the line is ( p = a sin(60^circ - varphi) )     - The height of the triangle is given by ( h = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}a ). 6.

We use trigonometric identities to evaluate:     - (sin(60^circ + varphi) = sin 60^circ cos varphi + cos 60^circ sin varphi)     - (sin(60^circ - varphi) = sin 60^circ cos varphi - cos 60^circ sin varphi) 8. Substituting,     - (sin(60^circ) = frac{sqrt{3}}{2})     - (cos(60^circ) = frac{1}{2})    Therefore,    [    sin^2(60^circ + varphi) = left( frac{sqrt{3}}{2}cos varphi + frac{1}{2}sin varphi right)^2    ]    and    [    sin^2(60^circ - varphi) = left( frac{sqrt{3}}{2}cos varphi - frac{1}{2}sin varphi right)^2.    ] 9.

We are asked to prove that QG = GH = QI = QJ. # Step-by-Step Solution: 1. **Define the Points**:    - P lies on the altitude CD.    - PE parallel BC and PE intersects AB at E and AC at H.    - PF parallel AB and PF intersects CB at F and CA at I.    - PG parallel CA and PG intersects BC at G and BA at J.     2. **Setup of Problem in triangle ABC**:    - Note that because C = frac{pi}{2}, triangle ABC is a right-angled triangle.     - By defining these intersecting points relative to P lying on the altitude, we are setting up geometric relations that rely on similar triangles and cyclic quadrilaterals. 3. **Properties of Parallels**:    - Since PE parallel BC and PF parallel AB and PG parallel CA, several similar triangles and angle equalities are formed. 4. **Similar Triangles and Angle Chasing:**    - Triangles triangle PAE and triangle PCA are similar by AA criterion because angle APE = angle ACP and angle EPA = angle PAC.    - Similarly, triangle PGB and triangle PCA are similar.    - Through parallel segments and similar triangles, PE parallel BC implies the angles formed at intersections lead to symmetrical relationships.     5. **Cyclic Quadrilaterals Consideration:**    - Utilize the diagram to show that J, E, F, G, H lie on a circle with center Q.    - Similarly, G, H, I, J, E, F also lie on a circle with center Q. 6. **Equal Radii**:    - Since these points lie on the circle centered at Q:      - QG = QH = QI = QJ (all radii of the same circle). 7. **Verification by Power of Point Theorem** (or Circle Properties):    - As an additional step to verify:      [      CF^2 = (CP sin P) ^2 = PA sin P cdot PB sin P = AD cdot BE      ]    - This equality supplements the idea that each of these segments extend to equal radii circles upon intersection. # Conclusion: We conclude that: [ QG = GH = QI = QJ  ] boxed{QG = GH = QI = QJ}"},{"instruction":"Let x, y, and z be nonnegative real numbers such that x + y + z = 3 and x = y.

Let's proceed with the detailed steps: 1. **Definition and Basic Assumption:**    Assume that there are six four-digit numbers, say (a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5, a_6). These numbers are pairwise relatively prime which means ( gcd(a_i, a_j) = 1 ) for all (i neq j). 2. **Contradiction Approach:**    Assume, for contradiction, that it is not possible to choose five numbers among (a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_5, a_6) that are pairwise relatively prime. 3. **Partition Possible Scenarios:**    If it is not possible to choose five numbers that are pairwise coprime, then within any subset of five numbers, there must be at least one pair with a common factor larger than 1. 4. **Evaluate All Possible Pairs:**    Let’s consider any subset of five numbers among the six given numbers. Due to the pairwise relatively prime condition of the six numbers, each of these five-number subsets must include all unique common factors larger than 1. 5. **Using Pigeonhole Principle:**    According to the Pigeonhole Principle, if we distribute ( k+1 ) pigeons into ( k ) pigeonholes, at least one pigeonhole must contain more than one pigeon. Here, each common divisor within the subset of five numbers implies that there should be a repetition of common factors for this to be true, hence contradicting the initial condition that the set of six numbers are pairwise relative prime. 6. **Completion and Final Observation:**    Therefore, the initial assumption that it is not possible to select any five numbers to be pairwise relatively prime implies a contradiction. Hence, it must be true that we can always pick five numbers from the six four-digit pairwise relatively prime numbers to ensure the selected subset is pairwise relatively prime. # Conclusion Therefore, the solution shows that it's always possible to select five four-digit numbers from any six that are pairwise relatively prime and ensure the selected five numbers are also pairwise relatively prime.

Multiplying these ratios together, we get:    [    left( frac{AE}{EB} right) left( frac{BF}{FC} right) left( frac{CG}{GD} right) left( frac{DH}{HA} right) = left( frac{-d_1}{d_2} right) left( frac{-d_2}{d_3} right) left( frac{-d_3}{d_4} right) left( frac{-d_4}{d_1} right) = 1    ] 5. Now, consider any other orientation of the tetragon. Let H' be a point on DA such that E, F, G, H' are coplanar. Define d_1', d_2', d_3', d_4' as the signed distances from A, B, C, D to this new plane. 6. Using the same logic as before, we have:    [    frac{AE}{EB} = frac{-d_1'}{d_2'}, quad frac{BF}{FC} = frac{-d_2'}{d_3'}, quad frac{CG}{GD} = frac{-d_3'}{d_4'}, quad frac{DH'}{H'A} = frac{-d_4'}{d_1'}    ] 7. Multiplying these ratios together, we get:    [    left( frac{AE}{EB} right) left( frac{BF}{FC} right) left( frac{CG}{GD} right) left( frac{DH'}{H'A} right) = left( frac{-d_1'}{d_2'} right) left( frac{-d_2'}{d_3'} right) left( frac{-d_3'}{d_4'} right) left( frac{-d_4'}{d_1'} right) = 1    ] 8. Since the product of the ratios is 1 in both cases, it implies that:    [    frac{DH}{HA} = frac{DH'}{H'A}    ]    Therefore, H = H', meaning that the point H does not change its position relative to the plane containing E, F, G. 9. Hence, we have shown that E, F, G, H remain coplanar for any orientation of the tetragon. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"The distance from point P(0,1) to the asymptotes of the hyperbola frac {y^{2}}{4}x^{2}=1 is (　　) A: sqrt {5} B: frac {sqrt {5}}{5} C: frac {2sqrt {5}}{5} D: 5","output":"According to the problem, the equation of the hyperbola is frac {y^{2}}{4}-x^{2}=1,   thus, the equations of its asymptotes are y=pm2x, or 2xpm y=0,   the distance d from point P(0,1) to the line 2x-y=0 is d= frac {|2times0-1|}{sqrt {4+1}}= frac {sqrt {5}}{5},   therefore, the correct answer is boxed{B}.

Using this transformation:     (frac{a}{35-a} + 1) + (frac{b}{75-b} + 1) + (frac{c}{85-c} + 1) = 5 + 3 = 8.     That simplifies to:     frac{35}{35-a} + frac{75}{75-b} + frac{85}{85-c} = 8.  3. Focus on the expression to evaluate:     frac{7}{35-a} + frac{15}{75-b} + frac{17}{85-c}.     Since we know the value of:     frac{35}{35-a} + frac{75}{75-b} + frac{85}{85-c} = 8,     multiply these transformations by 7, 15, and 17 respectively:    - Scale factor for frac{35}{35-a} is frac{7}{35},    - Scale factor for frac{75}{75-b} is frac{15}{75},    - Scale factor for frac{85}{85-c} is frac{17}{85}.    So,     frac{7}{35-a} = frac{1}{5} times frac{35}{35-a},     frac{15}{75-b} = frac{1}{5} times frac{75}{75-b},     frac{17}{85-c} = frac{1}{5} times frac{85}{85-c}.    Adding these up,     frac{7}{35-a} + frac{15}{75-b} + frac{17}{85-c} = frac{1}{5} times 8 = frac{8}{5}.

For the 2-liter vessel with 20% alcohol: Amount of alcohol = 20% of 2 liters = 0.20 * 2 = 0.4 liters For the 6-liter vessel with 40% alcohol: Amount of alcohol = 40% of 6 liters = 0.40 * 6 = 2.4 liters Now, let's combine the alcohol from both vessels: Total alcohol = 0.4 liters + 2.4 liters = 2.8 liters The total volume of the mixture is 8 liters (since both vessels were poured out into a new vessel). Now we need to calculate the concentration of alcohol in the 8-liter mixture. Concentration of alcohol in the mixture = (Total alcohol / Total volume) * 100 Concentration of alcohol in the mixture = (2.8 liters / 8 liters) * 100 Concentration of alcohol in the mixture = 0.35 * 100 Concentration of alcohol in the mixture = 35% Now, the rest of the 10-liter vessel is filled with water. Since the mixture already occupies 8 liters, the remaining volume to be filled with water is 2 liters. Adding water does not change the amount of alcohol, so the concentration of alcohol in the 10-liter vessel will be based on the total volume of 10 liters. New concentration of alcohol in the 10-liter vessel = (Total alcohol / Total volume of the 10-liter vessel) * 100 New concentration of alcohol in the 10-liter vessel = (2.8 liters / 10 liters) * 100 New concentration of alcohol in the 10-liter vessel = 0.28 * 100 New concentration of alcohol in the 10-liter vessel = 28% Therefore, the new concentration of the mixture in the 10-liter vessel is boxed{28%} ."},{"instruction":"Let U=3cdot 2005^{2006}, V=2005^{2006}, W=2004cdot 2005^{2005}, X=3cdot 2005^{2005}, Y=2005^{2005} and Z=2005^{2004}.

Hence, ( n = 1 ) and ( n = 3 ) are solutions. 2. **Assume ( n > 1 )**:    Let us consider ( n > 1 ). We select ( p ), the smallest prime divisor of ( n ). Note that ( n ) must be odd since ( n mid 2^n + 1 ), and hence ( p ) is also odd. 3. **Order of 2 modulo ( p )**:    If ( p mid n ), then by the given condition ( n^2 mid 2^n + 1 ), it is implied that ( 2^n equiv -1 pmod{p} ). Thus, ( 2^{2n} equiv 1 pmod{p} ). The order of 2 modulo ( p ), therefore, must divide both ( 2n ) and ( p-1 ).    By Fermat's Little Theorem, ( 2^{p-1} equiv 1 pmod{p} ). Therefore, the order ( d ) of 2 modulo ( p ) divides ( p-1 ). Moreover, since ( p ) is the smallest prime divisor of ( n ), we have (gcd(p-1, n) = 1). 4. **Possible orders of 2 modulo ( p )**:    Combining the facts, the order must be either 1, 2, or any divisor of ( p-1 ). This leaves the possibilities ( d = 1 ) or ( d = 2 ) because higher divisors would imply ( p-1 ) has common factors with ( n ).    - If ( d = 1 ):      [      2 equiv 1 pmod{p} rightarrow text{impossible since } p neq 2.      ]    - If ( d = 2 ):      [      2^2 equiv 1 pmod{p} rightarrow p = 3.      ]      Thus, ( p = 3 ) must divide ( n ).

Note that 2 has order 6 modulo 9:    [    2^1 equiv 2, quad 2^2 equiv 4, quad 2^3 equiv 8 equiv -1, quad 2^6 equiv 1.    ]    Since ( k ) is odd:    [    2^{3^{l-1} k} equiv -1 pmod{9}, quad 2^{2 cdot 3^{l-1} k} equiv 1 pmod{9}.    ]    Hence:    [    2^{2 cdot 3^{l-1} k} - 2^{3^{l-1} k} + 1 equiv 1 + 1 + 1 equiv 3 pmod{9}.    ]    Evaluating ( 2^{3^l k} + 1 ):    [    2^{3^{l-1}k} + 1 equiv 3 pmod{9}.    ]    Since ( 9 nmid 3 ), the term cannot be smaller than 9 left modulo 3.    Thus, ( l = 1 ) and ( n = 3 ). 7. **Certification for other ( k )**:    Continuing with ( k geq 2 ), assume ( k ) has a smallest prime divisor ( p geq 5 ). The conditions ( 2^{2n} equiv 1 pmod{p} ) imply order ( d mid 6 ), which limits us to possible values for ( p = 5, 7 ).

The rows adjacent to A are denoted as B and C where:      - If A is the first row, B is the second row and C is the third row.      - If A is the last row, B is the second last row and C is the third last row.      - Otherwise, B and C are the rows immediately above and below A. 4. **Case Analysis:**    - Let's consider the columns [leftlfloor frac{n}{2} rightrfloor + 1, ldots, n] and [2, 3, ldots, n - leftlfloor frac{n}{2} rightrfloor + 1].      - If b leq leftlfloor frac{n}{2} rightrfloor or b geq n - leftlfloor frac{n}{2} rightrfloor + 2  (where b is the column number in row B containing a marked square):        - The area of the rectangle formed by these columns in rows A and B is given by 2(n - leftlfloor frac{n}{2} rightrfloor).        - Thus, 2(n - leftlfloor frac{n}{2} rightrfloor) geq n implies n - leftlfloor frac{n}{2} rightrfloor geq frac{n}{2}.      - Therefore, this requires:        [        leftlfloor frac{n}{2} rightrfloor + 1 leq b leq n - leftlfloor frac{n}{2} rightrfloor + 1        ] 5. **Validation with Additional Rows:**    - Considering rows A, B, and C altogether with their respective columns, the formed rectangles must cover the grid without missing the marked square, achieving the goal when n geq 8. 6. **Conclusion for n geq 8:**    - For n geq 8, it can be shown that the rectangles of area at least n will contain a marked square, failing to meet the required conditions. 7. **Verification for n = 7:**    - For n = 7, there is a known configuration where marking the squares in a specific pattern can ensure that every rectangle with area at least 7 contains one of the marked squares.

Sophie brings in cans such that the ratio of the number of cans contributed by Mark, Jaydon, and Sophie is 4:3:2. Since Mark's ratio is 4 and represents 8R + 20 cans, we can say that each unit of the ratio represents (8R + 20)/4 = 2R + 5 cans. Therefore, Sophie's cans, which are 2 units of the ratio, can be represented as 2(2R + 5) = 4R + 10. The total number of cans is the sum of cans brought in by Mark, Jaydon, and Sophie, which is: Total = Mark's cans + Jaydon's cans + Sophie's cans Total = (8R + 20) + (2R + 5) + (4R + 10) Now, let's simplify the equation: Total = 8R + 20 + 2R + 5 + 4R + 10 Total = 14R + 35 We know that each individual must contribute at least 5 cans, so R ≥ 5. We also know that the total number of cans is an odd number which is not less than 250.

Substituting x = 2 into the equation of circle C, we get: (y - 1)^2 = 1. Solving for y, we get: y = 1 ± 1, so the length of the chord intercepted by circle C is 2, which satisfies the condition.

Hence, the radius (r) of the circle is:    [    r = frac{a}{2}    ] 4. **Calculate the Area of the Circle:**    The area of a circle is given by the formula:    [    text{Area of the circle} = pi r^2    ]    Substituting (r = frac{a}{2}):    [    text{Area of the circle} = pi left(frac{a}{2}right)^2 = pi frac{a^2}{4}    ] 5. **Find the Ratio of the Circle’s Area to the Square’s Area:**    To determine what fraction of the square's area is occupied by the circle, we divide the area of the circle by the area of the square:    [    text{Ratio} = frac{text{Area of the circle}}{text{Area of the square}} = frac{pi frac{a^2}{4}}{a^2} = frac{pi}{4}    ] 6. **Convert the Ratio to a Percentage:**    To convert this ratio into a percentage, multiply by 100:    [    text{Percentage} = left(frac{pi}{4}right) times 100 approx frac{3.141592653589793}{4} times 100 approx 78.53981633974483 %    ] 7. **Round to the Nearest Integer:**    Rounding (78.53981633974483% ) to the nearest whole number, we get:    [    79%    ] # Conclusion: The circle inscribed within a square occupies approximately (boxed{79}%) of the area of the square."},{"instruction":"Suppose that  x^{10} + x + 1 = 0  and  x^100 = a_0 + a_1x +... + a_9x^9 .

Notice that:    [    x^{100} = (x^{10})^{10}    ]    Substituting ( x^{10} = -x - 1 ) into the equation, we get:    [    x^{100} = (-x - 1)^{10}    ] 3.

However, since ( x^{10} = -x - 1 ), we can reduce any term with ( x^{10} ) or higher powers back to a polynomial of degree less than 10. 5. Specifically, we are interested in the coefficient ( a_5 ). From the binomial expansion:    [    (-x - 1)^{10} = sum_{k=0}^{10} binom{10}{k} (-1)^k x^k    ]    The coefficient of ( x^5 ) in this expansion is:    [    binom{10}{5} (-1)^5 = binom{10}{5} (-1)^5 = binom{10}{5} (-1) = -binom{10}{5}    ] 6. Calculating ( binom{10}{5} ):    [    binom{10}{5} = frac{10!}{5!5!} = frac{10 times 9 times 8 times 7 times 6}{5 times 4 times 3 times 2 times 1} = 252    ] 7.

Let's compare the price per rose for each option: - Individually: 4.50 per rose - One dozen (12 roses): 36 per dozen, which is 36 / 12 = 3 per rose - Two dozen (24 roses): 50 per two dozen, which is 50 / 24 ≈ 2.08 per rose The two dozen option gives us the lowest price per rose. So, we should buy as many two dozen sets as possible with the 680. Let's calculate how many two dozen sets we can buy with 680: 680 / 50 = 13.6 We can't buy a fraction of a set, so we can buy 13 sets of two dozen roses. 13 sets * 24 roses = 312 roses Now, we have to check if we can use the remaining money to buy more roses individually or by the dozen to maximize the total number of roses. The remaining money after buying 13 sets of two dozen roses is: 680 - (13 * 50) = 680 - 650 = 30 With the remaining 30, we can buy roses individually or by the dozen. Since the dozen option gives us a lower price per rose than buying individually, we should check if we can buy a dozen with the remaining money. 30 is not enough to buy a dozen for 36, so we have to buy the remaining roses individually. 30 / 4.50 = 6.666...

Total distance = Length of the train + Length of the bridge                = 70 meters + 80 meters                = 150 meters Now, we can calculate the time it will take for the train to cross the bridge by dividing the total distance by the speed of the train.

We start by finding a common denominator:    [    A = frac{a^2 + 1}{bc} + frac{b^2 + 1}{ca} + frac{c^2 + 1}{ab} = frac{a^2c + a^2b + b^2a + b^2c + c^2a + c^2b + 1 cdot ab + 1 cdot bc + 1 cdot ca}{abc}    ]    Simplifying the numerator, we get:    [    A = frac{a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + a + b + c}{abc}    ] 3. Let ( d = gcd(a, b, c) ). By definition, ( d ) divides ( a ), ( b ), and ( c ). Therefore, ( d^3 ) divides ( abc ). 4. Since ( d ) divides ( a ), ( b ), and ( c ), it follows that ( d^3 ) also divides ( a^3 ), ( b^3 ), and ( c^3 ). Hence, ( d^3 ) divides ( a^3 + b^3 + c^3 ). 5. Given that ( A ) is an integer, the numerator ( a^3 + b^3 + c^3 + a + b + c ) must be divisible by ( abc ). Since ( d^3 ) divides both ( abc ) and ( a^3 + b^3 + c^3 ), it must also divide ( a + b + c ). 6. Therefore, we have:    [    d^3 mid (a + b + c)    ]    This implies:    [    d^3 leq a + b + c    ] 7. Taking the cube root of both sides, we get:    [    d leq sqrt[3]{a + b + c}    ] 8.

If the shirts are 40% off, that means Zane is paying 60% of the original price (100% - 40% = 60%). The original price of each polo shirt is 50, so the discounted price is 60% of 50. To find 60% of 50, we calculate 0.60 * 50 = 30. Now, we know that Zane paid 60 for the polo shirts at the discounted price of 30 each.

What is the car's average speed for the entire trip?","output":"To calculate the average speed for the entire trip, we need to know the total distance and the total time taken for the trip. Since the trip is divided into three equal segments, we can assume each segment is the same distance, let's call it ( D ). For the first segment at 80 km/h: Time = Distance / Speed = ( D / 80 ) hours For the second segment at 24 km/h: Time = ( D / 24 ) hours For the third segment at 30 km/h: Time = ( D / 30 ) hours The total time for the trip is the sum of the times for each segment: Total Time = ( D / 80 + D / 24 + D / 30 ) To find a common denominator for the fractions, we can use the least common multiple (LCM) of 80, 24, and 30. The LCM of 80, 24, and 30 is 240. So we can rewrite the total time as: Total Time = ( (3D / 240) + (10D / 240) + (8D / 240) ) Total Time = ( (3D + 10D + 8D) / 240 ) Total Time = ( 21D / 240 ) Total Time = ( D / (240 / 21) ) Total Time = ( D / (80 / 7) ) Total Time = ( 7D / 80 ) hours The total distance for the trip is the sum of the distances for each segment, which is 3D since each segment is D. The average speed is the total distance divided by the total time: Average Speed = Total Distance / Total Time Average Speed = ( 3D / (7D / 80) ) To simplify, we can divide both the numerator and the denominator by D: Average Speed = ( 3 / (7 / 80) ) Average Speed = ( 3 * (80 / 7) ) Average Speed = ( 240 / 7 ) Average Speed ≈ 34.29 km/h So the car's average speed for the entire trip is approximately boxed{34.29}  km/h."},{"instruction":"Edward spent 2 on a board game and then he bought 4 action figures for 7 each.

The minimum value of y occurs when both |x+3| and |x-1| are at their minimum, which is when x = 1. At this point, we have y_{min}= |1+3| + |1-1| = 4 + 0 = 4. Hence, the minimum value of y is 4. For the inequality a^2 - 3a leq |x+3| + |x-1| to hold for all real x, it must be true when |x+3| + |x-1| is at its minimum value, thus: a^2 - 3a leq y_{min} a^2 - 3a leq 4 To find the range of a, solve the quadratic inequality: a^2 - 3a - 4 leq 0 Factoring the quadratic expression, we get: (a-4)(a+1) leq 0 The critical points where the sign of the inequality may change are a = 4 and a = -1. By testing points between and beyond these values, we find that the inequality holds true when -1 < a < 4. Thus, the range of a is -1 < a < 4.

The present value of the bill can be calculated as: PV = FV - TD PV = 2520 - 270 PV = Rs. 2250 The interest rate (R) is given as 16% per annum. Since we are dealing with months, we need to convert the annual interest rate to a monthly interest rate. There are 12 months in a year, so the monthly interest rate is: R_monthly = R_annual / 12 R_monthly = 16% / 12 R_monthly = 1.3333% per month (approximately) The true discount formula is: TD = (PV * R_monthly * m) / 100 We can rearrange this formula to solve for \\"m\\": m = (TD * 100) / (PV * R_monthly) Now we can plug in the values we have: m = (270 * 100) / (2250 * 1.3333) m = 27000 / 3000 m = 9 Therefore, the bill is due boxed{9}  months hence."},{"instruction":"The polynomial g(x) = x^4 + ax^3 + bx^2 + cx + d has real coefficients, and g(3i) = g(1+i) = 0.

In what time will they be clear of each other from the moment they meet?","output":"To solve this problem, we need to find the time it takes for both trains to pass each other completely from the moment they meet at the intersection. First, we need to convert the speeds from kilometers per hour (kmph) to meters per second (m/s) because the lengths of the trains are given in meters. Speed of the first train in m/s = 42 kmph * (1000 m / 1 km) * (1 hour / 3600 seconds) = 42 * 1000 / 3600 = 11.67 m/s Speed of the second train in m/s = 30 kmph * (1000 m / 1 km) * (1 hour / 3600 seconds) = 30 * 1000 / 3600 = 8.33 m/s Since the trains are moving towards each other, we need to find the relative speed at which they are approaching each other. Because the tracks intersect at a 45-degree angle, we cannot simply add their speeds. We need to use vector addition to find the resultant speed at which the distance between the trains is closing. The relative speed (Vr) can be found using the formula for the resultant velocity of two vectors at a 45-degree angle: Vr = √(V1^2 + V2^2 + 2 * V1 * V2 * cos(45°)) Where V1 is the speed of the first train, V2 is the speed of the second train, and cos(45°) is √2/2. Vr = √(11.67^2 + 8.33^2 + 2 * 11.67 * 8.33 * (√2/2)) Vr = √(136.3889 + 69.3889 + 194.0111) Vr = √(399.7889) Vr ≈ 19.99 m/s Now, we need to find the total length that needs to be cleared for the trains to be clear of each other. Since they are moving towards each other, we add the lengths of both trains: Total length to be cleared = Length of the first train + Length of the second train Total length to be cleared = 120 m + 280 m = 400 m Finally, we can find the time it takes for the trains to clear each other by dividing the total length by the relative speed: Time = Total length to be cleared / Relative speed Time = 400 m / 19.99 m/s ≈ 20.01 seconds Therefore, it will take approximately boxed{20.01}  seconds for the two trains to be clear of each other from the moment they meet."},{"instruction":"Given the function f(x)=(x2){e}^{x}frac{a}{2}({x}^{2}2x).<br/>(1) When a=e, find the maximum value of the function f(x) on the interval left[1,2right];<br/>(2) If f(x) has a local maximum point x_{0} and f(x_{0}) lt 0, find the range of values for a.","output":"**(1)** Given f(x) = (x-2)e^x - frac{a}{2}(x^2 - 2x), when a = e, we have: f(x) = (x-2)e^x - frac{e}{2}(x^2 - 2x).

Since e^x is an increasing function, for 1 leq x leq 2, we have e^x geq e, implying f'(x) geq 0. Therefore, f(x) is monotonically increasing on [1,2]. The maximum value of f(x) on this interval is attained at x=2: f(2) = (2-2)e^2 - frac{e}{2}(2^2 - 2cdot2) = 0.

Tanya then multiplied each of Vasya's numbers by the number written below it and obtained 200 consecutive natural numbers as a result. Prove that someone made a mistake.","output":"1. **Identify the Key Property of Digit Sums:**    A number is divisible by 3 or 9 if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3 or 9, respectively. This property will help us analyze the sums of digits of the given numbers. 2. **Analyze the Distribution of Sums divisible by 3:**    Among any set of 200 consecutive natural numbers, approximately 66 to 67 of them will be divisible by 3. This means the sums of the digits of these numbers will also be divisible by 3. 3. **Counting the Sums Divisible by 3:**    Let us denote by k the number of Vasya's sums that are divisible by 3. Then, if Petya correctly lists his sums, which are also sums of 200 consecutive natural numbers, there should be k sums divisible by 3 from Petya's list as well. 4. **Determine the Distribution of Multiples:**    Now consider Tanya's operation: multiplying each of Vasya's sums by the corresponding Petya's sums. Among these products, the number of results that must be divisible by 3 can be calculated. For each sum of digits from Vasya's list that is divisible by 3, if the corresponding Petya’s sum is also divisible by 3, thus the resulting product is divisible by 9. 5. **Minimum Multiples of 3 among 200 Results:**    The minimum number of resulting products that are divisible by 3 is given by:    [    k + 2(66 - k) = 132 - k    ]    Here, we used the fact that for 66 sums divisible by 3, there are at least 2(66 - k) additional sums among other sums possibly contributing to divisibility by 3. Hence, for the final product to be correct as stated in the problem (yielding 200 consecutive natural numbers), the above expression should be less than or equal to 67. 6. **Inequality and Contradiction:**    From the above expression, we get:    [    132 - k leq 67 implies k geq 65    ] 7. **Analyzing Numbers Divisible by 9:**    However, here arises a contradiction. If k geq 65, then among Petya’s sums, there must be at least:    - 65 sums that are divisible by 9 (since a sum divisible by 3 corresponding to another sum divisible by 3 in the product to give a multiplication by 9). 8. **Maximum Number of Multiples of 9:**    Among any 200 consecutive natural numbers, the maximum number of them divisible by 9 can only be about 22 (as 200/9 approx 22).    Therefore, if k geq 65, there need to be at least 65 sums divisible by 9, which contradicts the maximum number of consecutive multiples of 9. # Conclusion: Given this contradiction, we conclude that it is impossible for Tanya to obtain 200 consecutive natural numbers by multiplying Vasya's sums of digits with Petya's sums. Hence, someone among them must have made a mistake.  Therefore, the conclusion is: boxed{text{Someone among Vasya, Petya, or Tanya must have made a mistake.}}"},{"instruction":"On an 8 times 8 chessboard, there are 8 rooks positioned such that none of them can capture any other.

Prove that the areas of the territories of all the rooks are equal.","output":"1. **Understanding the Problem**:     - We have an 8 times 8 chessboard.     - There are 8 non-attacking rooks on the board.     - Each cell, based on specific rules, belongs to a particular rook.     - We need to prove that all rooks control exactly the same area. 2. **Rook Attack Patterns**:     - A rook moves and captures in a straight line, either horizontally or vertically.     - Each rook thus controls cells that are in its row or column. 3. **Counting Controlled Cells for a Rook**:     - A single rook on the board can directly control its own cell plus all other cells in its row and column.     - This gives (7 + 7 + 1 = 15) cells: 7 in the row, 7 in the column, and its own cell. 4. **Distribution of Shared Cells**:     - Consider two rooks, say (A) and (B):       - If both rooks are in different rows and columns, they only share cells on their intersecting row and column.       - For any cell in the intersection of their row and column, this cell belongs to the nearest rook. If both are equidistant, the cell is shared evenly. 5. **Applying the Rules**:     - Place the rook (A) at a cell ((i, j)) and rook (B) at ((k, j)):       - Cell ((i, j)) belongs to rook (A).       - Cell ((k, j)) belongs to rook (B).       - Cells between ((i, k)) vertically are split.    6. **Generalizing the Idea**:     - Each rook vertically and horizontally controls specific cells.     - When another rook affects a cell in its path, the cells are shared based on proximity.     - Each rook gets half the cells that two rooks could dispute.    7. **Solid Example using (A, B, C, D)**:     - Assume (A) at ((1, 1)) and another rook (B) at ((2, 1)):       - Cells in row 1 and 2 vertically are shared.       - If two rooks dispute a cell equally, then that cell is split. 8. **Final Calculation**:     - Since each rook controls exactly 15 cells:       - 1 cell (where it stands) + 14 cells shared with other rooks.       - Consider that control, split cells mean each rook effectively controls the equivalent of 8 cells. 9. **Conclusion**:     - By the nature of the setup and symmetrical sharing of cells, every rook ends up controlling the exact same area due to even splitting.     - Hence, each rook controls the same (8) cells.

Our goal is to see under what conditions all digits can be the same ('0' or '1') after a number of steps. 3. **Consider (N neq 2^k)**: Suppose that (N) is not a power of 2. We shall prove that under any unfavorable conditions, Ali-Baba will never be able to open the cave because an adversarial move can always be made to prevent all digits from becoming uniform. 4. **Odd Case ((N) is odd)**: Let’s first handle the case where (N) is odd. Place zeros and ones randomly around the circle so that there is a mix of zeros and ones.    - Assume that Ali-Baba switches certain (k) digits at every turn.    - Ali-Baba wins only if all the selected (k) digits match either the set of all zeros or all ones.    - Since the sum of these digits is odd, the number of zeros is not equal to the number of ones. Thus, by rotating the circle’s digits, we can always position these dissimilar digits into the selected (k) places, preventing Ali-Baba from achieving uniform digits after any move. 5. **Even Case with an Odd Factor ((N) is even but has an odd factor (m))**: Break the large circle into a smaller subset of (m) positions and ignore the rest. Follow the same reasoning applied in the odd case to prevent Ali-Baba from achieving the uniformly same digits. 6. **Special Case for (2^k)**: We handle the case where (N = 2^k) inductively.     - **Base case (k=0)**: The trivial case where (N = 1), there’s nothing to rotate, and the cave is already \\"open.\\"          - **Induction step**: Suppose we have an algorithm ( A_m ) that works for (m = 2^k). Build the algorithm (A_{2m}) for (2m = 2^{k+1}):                  1. Divide the circle into pairs of opposite positions and treat each pair as a single unit.                  2. If all pairs are equal, apply ( A_m ) to these units. The cave, therefore, opens in this scenario if ( A_m ) succeeds.         3. If sums in the pairs have the same parity, use ( A_m ) for these units. If unsuccessful, all sums remain odd, and switching all digits to the other within the unit doesn't change parity.                  4. Apply an operation ( D ) (changing (m) digits around) to toggle between operation types ensuring all sums are now even. Reapply ( A_m ) to open the cave if properly adjusted.     - **Algorithm (B)** is defined for setting uniform same parity in pairs. Algorithm (C) ensures sum parities will match through step-wise selection and parity switching. 7. **Final Result**: Therefore, using the combined reinforced operation strategies involving (B) and sequential parities (D) ensures (A_{2^k}) works for (2^k), ensuring uniform head position for these specific values of (N). # Conclusion: [  boxed{N = 2^{k}, ; k=0,1,2, ldots} ]"},{"instruction":"the geometric sequence {a_n}, if aa_5a_7=3 sqrt{3}, then a_2a_8= (   ) A: 3 B:  sqrt{17} C: 9 D: 13","output":"Given that aa_5a_7=-3 sqrt{3}, we can first find the common ratio r of the geometric sequence.

The external tangent planes form a cone similar to part (a), but the plane through points X will intersect with the axial section of the cone. 4. The axle section will now consist of parts that contain both forward and backward from the centers, forming symmetrical regions about the axial plane section in Pi. 5. Therefore, the locus of points will include lines through symmetric areas with respect to the common external tangent circles. Conclusion:  boxed{text{Symmetrical regions about the external tangents of S_1 and S_2}} # Summary - For internal tangency, the geometric locus of points consists of all points outside the axial section of the cone. - For external tangency, the geometric locus of points forms symmetrical areas with respect to the external tangents. Thus, both cases provide geometric loci configurations for the specific tangency conditions described. \`\`\`"},{"instruction":"Given sin alpha cos alpha =frac{{12}}{{25}}, alpha in left(frac{pi}{2},0right), then cos alpha sin alpha = A: frac{1}{5} B: frac{1}{5} C: frac{7}{5} D: frac{7}{5}","output":"Given sin alpha cos alpha =-frac{12}{25}, and knowing that alpha is in the interval left(-frac{pi}{2},0right), we can deduce the signs of sin alpha and cos alpha based on the quadrant in which alpha lies. 1. Since sin alpha cos alpha =-frac{12}{25} < 0 and alpha is in the fourth quadrant where sin alpha < 0 and cos alpha > 0, we can confirm the signs of sin alpha and cos alpha. 2. To find cos alpha -sin alpha, we can square and then take the square root of the expression to maintain its value:    [    cos alpha -sin alpha =sqrt{(cos alpha - sin alpha)^{2}}    ] 3.

We need to prove that the center of the polygon S is inside P for n ge 4. 2. **Number of Unique Chords:**    We start by identifying how many unique lengths of chords can be formed with the vertices of the regular polygon S.     [    text{Number of vertices} = n^2 + n + 1.    ]    Choosing a vertex A, each chord length can be paired symmetrically about the center due to the rotational symmetry of S.

Let AB be this longest chord. 5. **Assumption of Non-Inclusion of Center:**    Assume, for contradiction, that the center O is not inside P. This would imply all other vertices of P are on one side of the chord AB. 6. **Points on one side of AB:**    Since O is inside triangle ABC when considering any additional vertices beyond A and B, we realize that all these vertices lie on one arc of the circumcircle, subtending an angle less than 180^circ. The number of these divisions:    [    1 + frac{n^2 + n}{2}.    ] 7. **Contradiction with Unequal Chords:**    Referring to Theorem (the one suggested by problem 1224), if we try to pick A, B, and n-1 additional vertices such that all cords are unique, it yields the same problem and thus a contradiction arises with the assumption of unequal chords (Refer to **K. M. L. 27 (1963/12) 202. o**). 8. **Validity for n ge 4:**    For n ge 4, the unique-length condition leads us back to unequal chord lengths violating the arc properties of the circumcircle. Hence, the center O must be within the polygon P formed by (n+1) vertices to sustain the distinct chord lengths condition. 9. **Final Proof:**    Therefore, for any n ge 4, S's center O must be inside P to maintain the unique length condition of the chords, proving the original assertion. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"the rightangled triangle (ABC), a point (D) on the leg (AC) is given.

Let's go through the steps to identify the non-standard medal: 1. **First Weighing:**    We compare the following groups on the balance scale:    - Left Pan: (3G, 3S, 3B)     - Right Pan: (3G, 3S, 3B)        Possible outcomes:    - **Balance is equal:** No non-standard medal among these 6G, 6S, 6B. The non-standard medal must be among the remaining medals: (1G, 1S, 1S, 1S, 1B, 1B, 1B).    - **One pan is heavier:** Indicates non-standard medal is in one of the compared groups. Suppose the left pan is heavier. Then, possible suspects are: (2G, 2S) from the lighter pan, and (3B, 2S) from the heavier pan. 2. **Second Weighing (if balance was unequal):**    Compare the following on the balance scale:    - Left Pan: (3G, 1S, 1B)     - Right Pan: (3G, 1S, 1B)        Possible outcomes:    - **Balance is unequal:** Non-standard medal must be among the current comparisons. Suppose the left pan is lighter. Then possible suspects are:      - (3G, 1S) from the lighter pan or,       - (1B) from the heavier pan.    - **Balance is equal:** Non-standard medal must be among the remaining unweighed medals, which are (1G, 1S, 1S, 1S, 2B). 3. **Third Weighing:**    - Pick any standard medal from our previous group and compare:      - Assume standard medals are chosen from earlier successful groups.      - Compare (G, S) and one suspect non-standard from the remaining suspect group.          Suppose in our previous weighing, (3G) and (1S) were in balance, leaving us with suspect (1B). Here we would weigh (G·S) which produced trusted balance. 4. **If balance was unequal in the first weighing:**     - Separate suspects; compare by choosing only suspect medals:    - If the suspect ( 3B ) tends heavy, it must be non-standard. # Conclusion: After three comparisons using balanced scales, we can identify the one non-standard medal by process of elimination and comparison of masses.

Thus, ( f(0) ) cannot be negative. 5. **Case ( f(0) = 0 ):**    If ( f(0) = 0 ), then:    [    0 = max (f(z), 0).    ]    This implies ( f(z) leq 0 ), and since ( f(z) geq 0 ) (from earlier argument), ( f ) is the zero function. Thus, ( f(x) = 0 ) for all ( x ). 6. **Case ( f(0) > 0 ):**    Assuming ( f(0) > 0 ):    [    f(0) = max (f(z), f(0) f(z)) = max (f(-z), f(0) f(-z)).    ]    Therefore, ( f(z) = f(-z) ), suggesting ( f ) must be symmetric around the origin and thus constant not only on ( mathbb{R}^{-} ), but on all of ( mathbb{R} ). 7. **Verification of the constant function:**    Based on previous conclusions, we assert that for ( f(x) = c ) where ( c equiv f(0) ), ( f ) solves the functional equation. Hence,    [    f(xy) = max {f(x+y), f(x)f(y)}.    ]    Since ( f ) is constant, ( f(xy) = c ), ( f(x+y) = c ), and ( f(x)f(y) = c^2 ), verifying ( c = 1 ). 8. **Conclusion:**    ( f ) being constant with values satisfying ( 0 leq f(0) leq 1 ), we deduce ( f(x) = c ). Therefore, the only functions satisfying the equation are ( f(x) = 0 ) or any constant value ( c neq 0) in interval ( (0, 1] ).

Since the speed of the train is given in kilometers per hour (kmph), we need to convert it to meters per second (m/s) to match the time unit (seconds). The conversion factor from kmph to m/s is 5/18 (since 1 km = 1000 meters and 1 hour = 3600 seconds). So, the speed of the train in m/s is: 72 kmph * (5/18) = 20 m/s Now, we know the train crosses the platform in 26 seconds at a speed of 20 m/s. The distance covered while crossing the platform is the length of the train plus the length of the platform. Distance covered = Speed * Time Distance covered = 20 m/s * 26 s = 520 meters This distance is the sum of the length of the train and the length of the platform.

Calculate possible combinations for each feasible k = 1, 2, dots, 8, where k neq 4.5.    - For k=1, mathcal{C} can't contain 1, choose k-1 = 0 elements from remaining 8: binom{8}{0}    - For k=2, mathcal{C} can't contain 2, choose k-1 = 1 element from remaining 7: binom{7}{1}    - Continue similarly for k=3, 4, 5, dots, 8.    - Sum all valid combinations:    [sum_{k=1}^8 binom{8}{k-1} - binom{8}{4}] (not subtracting any specific value since there's no symmetrical balance as in the original problem) Calculation: binom{8}{0} + binom{7}{1} + binom{6}{2} + binom{5}{3} + binom{4}{4} + binom{5}{5} + binom{6}{6} + binom{7}{7} = 1 + 7 + 15 + 10 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 37 Thus, boxed{37} is the number of possible ordered pairs (mathcal{C}, mathcal{D}).

This means the sequence {a_{n}} is monotonically increasing. 2. **Transformation of the Sum**:    - By manipulating the recursive formula, we find a_{n+1}-1=a_{n}^{2}-a_{n}=a_{n}(a_{n}-1).    - This leads to frac{1}{a_{n+1}-1}=frac{1}{a_{n}(a_{n}-1)}=frac{1}{a_{n}-1}-frac{1}{a_{n}}.    - Therefore, frac{1}{a_{n}}=frac{1}{a_{n}-1}-frac{1}{a_{n+1}-1}. 3. **Summation**:    - Let m=frac{1}{a_{1}}+frac{1}{a_{2}}+ldots +frac{1}{a_{2017}}.    - By applying the transformation, we get m=left(frac{1}{a_{1}-1}-frac{1}{a_{2}-1}right)+left(frac{1}{a_{2}-1}-frac{1}{a_{3}-1}right)+ldots +left(frac{1}{a_{2017}-1}-frac{1}{a_{2018}-1}right).    - This simplifies to m=frac{1}{a_{1}-1}-frac{1}{a_{2018}-1}=3-frac{1}{a_{2018}-1}. 4. **Analysis of a_{2018}**:    - Since a_{1}=frac{4}{3} > 1 and a_{n+1}-a_{n}=(a_{n}-1)^{2} > 0, we observe that the sequence grows and a_{2}=1+frac{4}{9}, a_{3}=1+frac{52}{81}, a_{4}=1+frac{6916}{6561} > 2, and so on, leading to a_{2018} > 2. 5. **Conclusion**:    - Given a_{2018} > 2, we have 0 < frac{1}{a_{2018}-1} < 1, which implies 2 < m < 3.    - Therefore, the integer part of m is 2.

Hence, we can write:    [    frac{AC}{CP} = frac{ED}{DP}    ] 2. **Equal Arcs and Angles**:    Since ( CD = EF ), arcs ( CD ) and ( EF ) have equal measure.

This gives us two inequalities:    - k-4 > 0 which simplifies to k > 4.    - 10-k > 0 which simplifies to k < 10. 2. For the foci to be on the x-axis, the distance along the x-axis (major axis) must be greater than the distance along the y-axis (minor axis). This means the denominator associated with x^2 must be larger than the denominator associated with y^2. Therefore, we have:    - k-4 > 10-k.

We will use a scaled-down version of the problem to simplify our calculations and then scale up the results. 1. **Scaling Down the Problem:**    The line segment from ((0,0)) to ((1001,429)) can be scaled down by dividing both coordinates by their greatest common divisor (GCD). The GCD of 1001 and 429 is 1, so the scaled-down line segment is from ((0,0)) to ((1001,429)). 2. **Simplifying the Problem:**    We can simplify the problem by considering the line segment from ((0,0)) to ((7,3)). This is because the line segment from ((0,0)) to ((1001,429)) is essentially 143 times the line segment from ((0,0)) to ((7,3)) (since (1001 = 7 times 143) and (429 = 3 times 143)). 3. **Equation of the Line:**    The equation of the line segment from ((0,0)) to ((7,3)) is:    [    y = frac{3}{7}x    ] 4. **Determining Close Points:**    A point ((x,y)) is considered close to the line if the circle or square centered at ((x,y)) intersects the line. The distance from a point ((x,y)) to the line (y = frac{3}{7}x) is given by:    [    text{Distance} = frac{|3x - 7y|}{sqrt{3^2 + 7^2}} = frac{|3x - 7y|}{sqrt{58}}    ]    For a point to be close, this distance must be less than or equal to (frac{sqrt{2}}{10}). 5. **Checking Points:**    We manually check the points ((0,0)), ((2,1)), ((3,1)), ((4,2)), ((5,2)), and ((7,3)) to see if their squares or circles intersect the line (y = frac{3}{7}x).    - For ((0,0)) and ((7,3)), these points are on the line, so their squares and circles intersect the line.    - For ((2,1)), ((3,1)), ((4,2)), and ((5,2)), we check if the distance from these points to the line is less than or equal to (frac{sqrt{2}}{10}). 6. **Counting Intersections:**    - The points ((2,1)) and ((5,2)) have their squares touching the line, but the circles do not.    - The points ((0,0)) and ((7,3)) have both their squares and circles touching the line. 7. **Scaling Up:**    Since the line segment from ((0,0)) to ((1001,429)) is 143 times the line segment from ((0,0)) to ((7,3)), we multiply the number of intersections by 143.    - The number of squares intersected is (2 times 143 + 2 times 144 = 574).    - The number of circles intersected is (0 times 143 + 2 times 144 = 288). 8. **Summing Up:**    The total number of intersections is (574 + 288 = 862).

Since x_{1} neq x_{0}, we get: (x_1-2)^2+(x_1-2)(x_0-2)+(x_0-2)^2-a=0. Using f′(x_0)=3(x_0-2)^2-a=0, we find (x_0-2)^2=frac{a}{3}. - For x_0=2-sqrt{frac{a}{3}}, solving the equation gives x_1=2+2sqrt{frac{a}{3}}, and thus x_1+2x_0=6. - For x_0=2+sqrt{frac{a}{3}}, solving the equation gives x_1=2-2sqrt{frac{a}{3}}, and thus x_1+2x_0=6.

Let's denote the hypotenuse of the right-angled triangle as ( c ) and one of the acute angles as ( alpha ).     2. For a right-angled triangle, the perimeter is ( a + b + c = 8 ). Given the relationships from trigonometry, we have ( a = c sin(alpha) ) and ( b = c cos(alpha) ).     3. Therefore, the perimeter can be written as:        [        c + c sin(alpha) + c cos(alpha) = 8        ]     4. Simplifying the above equation, we get:        [        c (1 + sin(alpha) + cos(alpha)) = 8        ]        [        c = frac{8}{1 + sin(alpha) + cos(alpha)}        ]     5. Using the trigonometric identity:        [        sin(alpha) + sin(90^circ - alpha) = sin(alpha) + cos(alpha)        ]     6. Therefore:        [        c = frac{8}{1 + sin(alpha) + cos(alpha)}        ]     7. Applying the sum-to-product identities, we use:        [        sin(A) + sin(B) = 2 sinleft(frac{A + B}{2}right) cosleft(frac{A - B}{2}right)        ]     8. Plugging in ( A = alpha ) and ( B = 90^circ - alpha ), we get:        [        sin(alpha) + cos(alpha) = 2 sinleft(frac{alpha + (90^circ - alpha)}{2}right) cosleft(frac{alpha - (90^circ - alpha)}{2}right) = 2 sin(45^circ) cosleft(alpha - 45^circright)        ]     9.

The value is minimized when ( cos(alpha - 45^circ) = 1 ), which occurs when ( alpha = 45^circ ).     **Conclusion**: Therefore, the triangle with the smallest hypotenuse is an isosceles right-angled triangle with ( alpha = 45^circ ).

Let's start by noting that Oleg wrote unique numbers above each of the 50 columns and to the left of each of the 50 rows of the ( 50 times 50 ) table. In total, there are 100 unique numbers, with 50 of these numbers being rational and the other 50 irrational.     2. The problem requires us to determine the maximum number of rational products in the multiplication table formed by the numbers written in each row and column. 3. Let us denote:     - ( x ) as the number of irrational numbers written on the left side of the table.     - ( 50 - x ) as the number of rational numbers written on the left side of the table. 4. Based on this, the remaining numbers written on the top of the table will be:     - ( 50 - x ) irrational numbers.     - ( x ) rational numbers.     5. When we form the multiplication products in the cells of the table, the product of a rational and an irrational number is always irrational. Therefore, to maximize rational products in the table, we need combinations of rational numbers from both the row and the column indices. 6. Let's analyze the formation of the table. Each cell ((i, j)) will contain the product of the number written in the (i)-th row and the (j)-th column. The products will be rational only if both of these numbers are rational. 7. The number of rational products can be calculated by the formula:     [     text{Number of rational products} = text{(# of rational numbers on LHS)} times text{(# of rational numbers on top)}     ]     Given our notation and constraints:     [     text{Number of rational products} = x times (50 - x)     ] 8. To find the maximum number of rational products, we need to maximize the function ( f(x) = x times (50 - x) ). 9. We recognize this as a quadratic function in the form (f(x) = 50x - x^2). To find the maximum value, we can complete the square or use the vertex formula of a parabola, (x = -frac{b}{2a}), where the quadratic function is ( ax^2 + bx + c ). Here, (a = -1) and (b = 50). Thus,     [     x = frac{50}{2 times 1} = 25.     ]      10. Substituting ( x = 25 ) into our function,     [     f(25) = 25 times (50 - 25) = 25 times 25 = 625.     ]     11. Hence, the maximum number of rational products that can be present in the table is ( 625 ). Since each multiplication entry is distinct by construction, the rest are irrational. The total number of entries in the table is (2500). Therefore, the number of irrational products is:     [     2500 - 625 = 1875.     ] 12. As (x) varies from 0 to 50, the calculations we did show that the maximum consistent and possible number of rational products is exactly 1250. Conclusion: The maximum number of rational products in the table that can be achieved is ( boxed{1250} )."},{"instruction":"Find the solution set of the inequality: x^{2}+4x+5 < 0","output":"First, let's multiply the inequality by -1 to make the leading coefficient positive, which reverses the inequality sign: x^{2}-4x-5 > 0 Then, factor the quadratic expression: (x-5)(x+1) > 0 Now, let's find the intervals where the quadratic is positive. The quadratic equals to zero at x=5 and x=-1. These values divide the number line into three intervals: (-infty,-1), (-1,5), and (5,infty). We can test a single value in each interval to see if the quadratic is positive or negative in that interval: - Test x=-2 in (-infty,-1): (-2-5)(-2+1) = 7 cdot (-1) = -7 < 0 - Test x=0 in (-1,5): (0-5)(0+1) = -5 cdot 1 = -5 < 0 - Test x=6 in (5,infty): (6-5)(6+1) = 1 cdot 7 = 7 > 0 The quadratic is positive in the intervals where our test value resulted in a positive number.

If the width of the pool bottom is x meters, then the length must be frac{4}{x} meters to maintain the area of 4 square meters. The cost of the pool bottom (which is 4 square meters) is 120 yuan per square meter, totaling 4 times 120 = 480 yuan.  The cost of the pool walls involves two parts:  - The long sides are 2 meters deep and frac{4}{x} meters long, with two such sides. So, their total area is 2 times 2 times frac{4}{x} = frac{16}{x} square meters. - The short sides are 2 meters deep and x meters wide, with two such sides as well. So, their total area is 2 times 2 times x = 4x square meters. The cost of the pool walls is 80 yuan per square meter, so the total cost for the walls is 80 times (frac{16}{x} + 4x) = 320 times (x + frac{4}{x}) yuan. Therefore, the functional relationship between the total cost y yuan of the pool and the width x meters of the pool bottom is given by: [y = 320(x + frac{4}{x}) + 480] # Part 2: Minimizing the Total Cost From the derived equation y = 320(x + frac{4}{x}) + 480, we want to find the minimum value.

According to the problem, Petya's incorrect sum is ( 44444 ) instead of the correct sum ( 12345 ). 4. We can write the following system of equations based on the information given:    [    begin{cases}    x + y = 12345     (10x + c) + y = 44444    end{cases}    ] 5.

Additionally, the points scored by each participant are less than the sum of the points scored by any other two participants. We need to prove that each participant scored more than 18 points. 1. **Assume the contrary (proof by contradiction):**     - Assume there is a participant who scored 18 points or less. Let (x) be the number of points scored by the participant who came last, and (y) be the number of points scored by the participant who came second to last.         [         x leq 18         ] 2. **Ordering of points:**     - Since all participants scored a different number of points, and (x < y), the following rankings exist by score: (y+1, y+2, dots, y+18). 3. **Analyzing the highest score:**     - The participant with the highest score, by ordering, would then have at least (y+18) points. 4. **Summing lowest scores:**     - The sum of points for the last place and second to last place participants is:         [         x + y leq 18 + y         ] 5. **Contradiction:**     - Since the highest point must be less than the sum of the points from any two participants, in this case:         [         y + 18 > 18 + y         ]     - This results in an obvious contradiction, as (y + 18) is clearly not less than or equal to (18 + y).

This implies the elements ( J_{1}, J_{2}, J_{3} ) and the elements ( P_{1}, P_{2}, P_{3} ) denote corresponding segments or points which are crucial to the proof. 2. **Step 2**: Proving the angle equality.    We need to demonstrate that the angles between the segments ( J_{1}J_{2} ) and ( J_{2}J_{3} ) are equal to the angles between corresponding segments involving points ( P_{1}, P_{2}, P_{3} ) and some other intermediate point ( W ).

We can use the formula for average marks to find the total marks: Average marks = (Total marks in all subjects) / (Number of subjects) We know Kamal's average marks are 71, and he has taken 5 subjects (English, Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, and Biology). Let's denote his marks in Mathematics as M. So, the total marks in all subjects would be: Total marks = 71 * 5 Now, we can calculate the total marks: Total marks = 71 * 5 = 355 We also know the marks he obtained in the other four subjects: English = 76 Physics = 72 Chemistry = 65 Biology = 82 Now, we can calculate the total marks he obtained in these four subjects: Total marks in four subjects = 76 + 72 + 65 + 82 Let's calculate that: Total marks in four subjects = 295 Now, we can find Kamal's marks in Mathematics by subtracting the total marks in the four subjects from the total marks in all subjects: M = Total marks - Total marks in four subjects Let's calculate M: M = 355 - 295 M = 60 So, Kamal's marks in Mathematics are boxed{60} ."},{"instruction":"triangle XYZ, the sides are in the ratio 3:4:5.
