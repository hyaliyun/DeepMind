First, let's find the perimeter of the rectangle formed after cutting and bending the wire. Since the sides are in the ratio of 6:5, let's denote the longer side as 6x and the shorter side as 5x. We are given that the shorter side is 59.975859750350594 cm, so: 5x = 59.975859750350594 cm To find x, we divide the length of the shorter side by 5: x = 59.975859750350594 cm / 5 x = 11.995171950070119 cm Now we can find the length of the longer side: 6x = 6 * 11.995171950070119 cm 6x = 71.97103170042071 cm The perimeter (P) of the rectangle is the sum of all its sides: P = 2 * (length + width) P = 2 * (6x + 5x) P = 2 * (71.97103170042071 cm + 59.975859750350594 cm) P = 2 * (131.9468914507713 cm) P = 263.8937829015426 cm This perimeter is equal to the circumference of the original circle.

It turns out that these four tangents form a quadrilateral that contains both circles inside it. Prove that a circle can be inscribed in this quadrilateral.","output":"Let's systematically approach the problem by proving that a circle can be inscribed in the quadrilateral formed by the four tangent lines drawn from points (A) and (B) to the two given circles. Here's the formal proof: 1. **Naming Key Points and Centers**:    - Let (A) and (B) be points such that the line segment (AB) intersects the circles at two distinct points each.    - Label the centers of the circles (O_1) and (O_2), respectively.    - Denote the tangents from (A) to the circle closer to (A) as points (C) and (D), such that (A), (C), (D) are on the same circle.    - Similarly, denote the tangents from (B) to the circle closer to (B) as points (K) and (L), such that (B), (K), (L) are on the same circle. 2. **Reflection of the Problem Geometry**:     - Reflect the entire configuration such that the points (B) and the tangents from (B) are shifted leftwards parallel to the line (O_1 O_2) by a distance equal to (O_1 O_2). In this new arrangement, label the new position of (B) as (B') which lies on the line segment (AB). 3. **Observing the Changes**:    - In the transformed scenario, the two original circles coincide because they have been shifted parallel to (O_1 O_2).    - The tangents from the original (B) (now moved to (B')) to the new circle correlate with the tangents originally at (A). 4. **Applying Homothety**:    - Utilize a homothety centered at (A) with a scale factor equal to the ratio ( frac{AD}{AB'} ).    - This homothety translates point (B') back to (B) and maps the tangents (B'K) and (B'L) to (BD) and (BC) respectively. 5. **Conclusion of the Process**:    - Since the tangents (A) to (C) and (D) remain unchanged and lines (B'C) and (B'D) remain become (BC) and (BD) respectively, the quadrilateral (AKB'L) is mapped to the original quadrilateral (ADBC).    - Due to the nature of homothety's properties, (AKB'L) is cyclic (a circle can be inscribed in (AKB'L)).    - Hence, the original quadrilateral (ADBC) must also be cyclic.

As A_1 is the centroid of triangle SBC, point D will be the midpoint of BC.     - The plane formed by SAA_1 intersects the plane ABC at line AD. Thus, points A, M, and D lie on line AD. 2. **Determine Vectors**:     - Since A_1 is the centroid of triangle SBC, we can write the vector overrightarrow{SA_1} as:       overrightarrow{SA_1} = frac{2}{3} overrightarrow{SD}         This is due to the property of centroids where the centroid divides the line segment connecting the vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side in the ratio 2:1.     - Substituting in overrightarrow{AA_1} based on the same centroid properties, we get:       overrightarrow{AA_1} = frac{2}{3} overrightarrow{AD} + frac{1}{3} overrightarrow{AS} 3. **Calculate Vector overrightarrow{AG}**:     - Given frac{|AG|}{|GA_1|} = 3, we can determine G divides AA_1 externally in the ratio 3:1. This results in:       overrightarrow{AG} = frac{3}{4} overrightarrow{AA_1}     - Substitute overrightarrow{AA_1} from above:       overrightarrow{AG} = frac{3}{4} left( frac{2}{3} overrightarrow{AD} + frac{1}{3} overrightarrow{AS} right) = frac{1}{2} overrightarrow{AD} + frac{1}{4} overrightarrow{AS} 4. **Identify Intersection M**:     - Since M is the point where SG intersects triangle ABC, M lies on line AD.     - Hence, for some lambda, overrightarrow{AM} = lambda overrightarrow{AD}. Since A_1 is the centroid of triangle ABC, M must proportionately divide AD in the same fixed ratios. Using the line segment property, we know:       frac{1}{2} overrightarrow{AD} = frac{3}{4} overrightarrow{AM}     - Simplifying, we find:       overrightarrow{AM} = frac{2}{3} overrightarrow{AD}       - Given M is the intersection point which naturally centers ADM on G, M presents as the centroid of triangle ABC. As centroids segment, here overrightarrow{A_1M} is parallel to overrightarrow{SA}. 5. **Determine Ratio frac{|A_1 M|}{|A S|}**:     - Such that A_1M parallel SA, the ratio length spans to:       frac{left|A_1 Mright|}{|A S|} = frac{1}{3}   Due to point M as centroid transforming properties along triangle ABC.

The value of the PlayStation is 400, so the loss can be calculated as: [400 times 0.2 = 80] 2. **Determine the selling price of the PlayStation:** Since he loses 80 on the sale, the selling price of the PlayStation is: [400 - 80 = 320] 3. **Calculate the total cost of the new computer and accessories:** The computer costs 700 and the accessories cost 200, so the total cost is: [700 + 200 = 900] 4. **Find out how much money came out of John's pocket:** John has 320 from selling his PlayStation, but the total cost for the new computer and accessories is 900. Therefore, the amount of money that came out of his pocket is: [900 - 320 = 580] So, the final answer, encapsulated as requested, is boxed{580}."},{"instruction":"w many positive divisors does 36 have?","output":"We will find the positive divisors of 36 by finding pairs that multiply to 36.

Setting f'(x) = 0 yields the equation: x^2 - mx + 1 = 0. The discriminant Delta of this quadratic equation is m^2 - 4. - When Delta < 0 (i.e., 0 < m < 2), the equation f'(x) = 0 has no real roots; - When Delta = 0 (i.e., m = 2), the equation f'(x) = 0 has a unique root x = 1; - When Delta > 0 (i.e., m > 2), the equation f'(x) = 0 has two roots: x = frac{m pm sqrt{m^2 - 4}}{2}. Therefore, f(x) is monotonically increasing when 0 < x < frac{m - sqrt{m^2 - 4}}{2} or x > frac{m + sqrt{m^2 - 4}}{2}, and monotonically decreasing when frac{m - sqrt{m^2 - 4}}{2} < x < frac{m + sqrt{m^2 - 4}}{2}. In summary: - For 0 < m le 2, f(x) is monotonically increasing on (0, +infty); - For m > 2, the increasing intervals of f(x) are (0, frac{m - sqrt{m^2 - 4}}{2}) and (frac{m + sqrt{m^2 - 4}}{2}, +infty), and the decreasing interval is left(frac{m - sqrt{m^2 - 4}}{2}, frac{m + sqrt{m^2 - 4}}{2}right). (2) To prove the second part, suppose there's a tangent line through the origin with equation y = kx (Since a tangent line at an extremum is horizontal and the extremum is less than 0, it cannot pass through the origin; thus k neq 0). Let the abscissa of the tangent point be x_0. By the geometric interpretation of the derivative, we have k = f'(x_0) = x_0 - frac{m}{x_0} + 1, and the ordinate of the tangent point y_0 = f(x_0) = frac{1}{2}x_0^2+ln x_0 - mx_0. Plugging this into the tangent line equation gives: frac{1}{2}x_0^2 + ln x_0 - mx_0 = x_0^2 - mx_0 + 1, which simplifies to begin{equation*} frac{1}{2}x_0^2 - ln x_0 + 1 = 0. quad (*) end{equation*} Let g(x_0) = frac{1}{2}x_0^2 - ln x_0 + 1, then the derivative is g'(x) = x - frac{1}{x}, hence the stationary point x=1 is a local minimum. Therefore we have g(x_0) ge g(1) = 1.5 > 0, meaning equation (*) has no solution, which implies that the curve y=f(x) has no tangent line through the origin.

They are confined in directions perpendicular to the others:       - The first cylinder can only move in the perpendicular direction of the second cylinder’s axis.       - Similarly, the second cylinder can only move in the perpendicular direction of the first cylinder’s axis.     - The introduction of the third cylinder, with an axis perpendicular to both, restricts all cylinders in their positions. 7. **Conclusion:**     - We conclude by confirming that no cylinder can change its position once all three are placed as described. Each cylinder restricts the others, and thus, they remain firmly in place.

This occurs if and only if the greatest common divisor (gcd) of ( a ) and ( m ) divides ( b ). Mathematically, this is expressed as: [ gcd(a,m) mid b ]  Step 2: Solve the Congruence Suppose ( d = gcd(a,m) ), and it divides ( b ).

By the properties of the Fibonacci sequence, we know that ( (F_{k}, F_{k-1}) = 1 ) for all ( k ).

Therefore, a number that is congruent to 2 or 3 modulo 5 cannot be a perfect square. 5. **Conclusion:**    From the periodic pattern of ( F_{2n} mod 5 ), we see that at least one of ( F_{2n-2}, F_{2n}, F_{2n+2} ) is congruent to 2 or 3 modulo 5. Hence, at least one of these numbers is not a perfect square.

These allocations ensure that the sum of each row and each column is odd. Therefore, the successful arrangements (numbering) for each of these cases are as follows: [ (6 times 34 + 21 times 2) times 8! ] where (8!) refers to the permutations of odd numbers in black squares.

Hence, G in EF. 3. **Iran Lemma Application:**    - By the Iran Lemma in triangle APC, T lies on odot(AC) and the homothety of line BC through A by a factor of frac{1}{2}. Thus, T is fixed regardless of P. 4. **Restate the Problem:**    - Point K moves on BI.

We will show that G moves on line XY.    - Consider the following three special cases:      - **(i):** K = B. Then G = Y.      - **(ii):** K = BI cap AC. Then G = X.      - **(iii):** K = BI cap XY. Then G = BI cap XY. 8. **Conclusion:**    - Note that all three cases are non-trivial and we need the Iran Lemma (with respect to triangle ABC) in all of them. So we get three different positions of G lie on line XY.    - Since a conic cannot contain three collinear points, using our claim, we conclude that G moves on line XY.

The statement is universally quantified, meaning it claims the inequality holds for all real numbers x. The negation of such a statement will switch from claiming the inequality holds for all x to claiming there exists at least one x for which the inequality does not hold as stated. Specifically, the negation involves changing the nature of the quantifier (from universal to existential) and the direction of the inequality (from > to leqslant). Let's break down the solution step by step: 1. The original statement is universally quantified over the real numbers (forall x in mathbb{R}) and claims that x^{2} + 2x + 1 > 0 for all x. 2. The negation of a universal statement (forall x) is an existential statement (exists x). This means instead of claiming the inequality holds for all x, we claim there is at least one x for which the opposite of the original claim holds. 3. The original inequality is >, so its opposite will be leqslant. This change is necessary because the negation of \\"greater than\\" involves \\"less than or equal to,\\" which includes both the possibility of being less than and the possibility of equality. 4. Combining steps 2 and 3, the negation of the original statement becomes: There exists at least one real number x for which x^{2} + 2x + 1 leqslant 0.

The area of a triangle formed by medians (e.g., ( MSC )) is known to be ( frac{3}{4} ) of the area of the original triangle. So if the area of triangle ( ABC ) is ( S ), then the area of the triangle formed by its medians ( MSC ) is:    [    S_{MSC} = frac{3}{4} times S    ] 5. However, since we need the area of a triangle whose sides themselves are segments ( frac{2}{3} ) the length of the corresponding medians, it implies another level of similarity with yet a reduced area:    [    S_{new} = left( frac{2}{3} right)^2 times S_{MSC}             = left( frac{2}{3} right)^2 times frac{3}{4} times S             = frac{4}{9} times frac{3}{4} times S             = frac{1}{3} S    ] 6. Thus, the area of the triangle with the given sides equal to medians of triangle ( ABC ) is:    [    boxed{frac{3}{4} S}     ] Concluding, the final area is: [ boxed{frac{3}{4} S} ] Therefore, if the sides of a triangle equal to the medians of triangle ( ABC ), the area of that triangle is ( boxed{frac{3}{4} S} )."},{"instruction":"Andrew has a fourdigit number whose last digit is  2 .

Analyzing the statements given in the problem, we need to validate each one of them against the information provided from the figure and context. 2. **Statement (1):** \\"The outflow volumes of the five outlets are the same.\\"        - Given the structure and operation of the tower and the arrows indicating the flow direction, different layers and outlets likely experience different volumes of outflow.    - Since the tower purifies water progressively down through the layers and eventually reaches the five outlets, the outflows are not uniform due to sequential filtering and distribution.    - Therefore, this statement is incorrect. 3. **Statement (2):** \\"The outflow volumes of outlet 2 and outlet 4 are the same.\\"        - Based on proportionality and the behavior described, there is a symmetrical distribution. Outlets 2 and 4, being symmetrically located, will have similar flow rates considering uniform input and symmetrical design.    - Thus, this statement is correct. 4. **Statement (3):** \\"The ratio of outflows of outlets 1, 2, and 3 is 1:4:6.\\"        - To determine this, let us consider the given water outflow rates:      - Given data:         - Outflow from outlet 1: frac{1}{16}        - Outflow from outlet 2: frac{1}{4}        - Outflow from outlet 3: frac{3}{8}      - To find the ratio frac{1/16}{1/4}:        [        frac{1/16}{1/4} = frac{1}{16} div frac{1}{4} = frac{1}{16} times 4 = frac{1}{4} = 0.25        ]      - To find the ratio frac{1/16}{3/8}:        [        frac{1/16}{3/8} = frac{1}{16} div frac{3}{8} = frac{1}{16} times frac{8}{3} = frac{1 cdot 8}{16 cdot 3} = frac{8}{48} = frac{1}{6}        ]      - Hence, combining these ratios, we get:        [        1:4:6 text{ (normalized ratios between the outlets)}        ]      - Therefore, this statement is correct. 5. **Statement (4):** \\"If the rate at which the purification materials wear out is directly proportional to the quantity of water passing over its surface, then the material in the slowest worn-out triangular section takes approximately 8 times longer to replace than the quickest worn-out section.\\"          - Considering degradation rates directly proportional to the volume of water treated, we focus on comparing the outlet flows.    - The sections contributing to the smallest and largest outflows (outlet 1 and the uppermost triangular section capturing the most, respectively) show highest and least degradation rates.    - Given:      - Slowest: Outflow = frac{1}{16}      - Quickest: Outflow = frac{1}{2} (total feeding top layer)      - Time ratio: 8 times due to proportional differentiations.    - Conclusion: Slowest section replacing time is 8 times longer, confirming the proportional relation between degradation and utilization. 6.

We need to carefully observe the change in the total number of coins as she plays the slot machine. 2. **Understanding the Machine's Operation:**    The slot machine's function is crucial:    - If Laura inserts a red coin, she receives 5 green coins.    - If she inserts a green coin, she receives 5 red coins. 3. **Change in Total Coins:**    Each interaction with the machine increases the total number of coins Laura has. When she inserts any coin, she gains 5 coins of the opposite color but loses the 1 coin she inserted:    - Net gain in coins when inserting one coin = 5 - 1 = 4 coins.    Thus, each transaction increases the total number of coins by 4. 4. **Tracking the Parity:**    - Laura starts with 1 coin, which is odd.    - After each transaction, since she gains 4 coins (an even number), the parity (odd/even nature) of the total number of coins remains the same:      - An odd number plus an even number is always odd. 5. **Logical Conclusion:**    - The total number of coins Laura has will always be odd, no matter how many times she uses the machine.    - For Laura to have the same number of coins of each color, she would need an even total number of coins (since equal numbers of red and green coins mean their sum must be even).

According to the problem, ( A ) gets twice as many candies as ( B ) and an additional amount, which can be written as:    [    A = 2B + x    ]    Also, ( B ) gets three times as many candies as ( C ) and an additional amount, which can be written as:    [    B = 3C + y    ] 3. From this information, we can summarize the total number of candies ( A + B + C = 200 ). 4. We now need to find the values of ( x ) and ( y ). Based on the multiplicative relationships given and additional numbers, the proper comprehensive formula combining these relationships must consider the base multiples and the added extras. 5.

Then,    [    a^n + b^n + c^n + d^n = 1^n + 1^n + 1^n + 1^n = 4    ]    Since 4 is composite, this case is trivial. 2. **General Case:**    Let (a, b, c, d) be any natural numbers. We need to show that there exist infinitely many natural numbers (n) such that (a^n + b^n + c^n + d^n) is composite. 3. **Prime Divisor:**    Let (p) be a prime divisor of (a + b + c + d). Such a prime (p) exists because (a + b + c + d) is a natural number greater than 1. 4. **Using Fermat's Little Theorem:**    - If (gcd(a, p) = 1), then by Fermat's Little Theorem, (a^{p-1} equiv 1 pmod{p}). Consequently, for any (k in mathbb{N}),      [      a^{k(p-1)} equiv 1 pmod{p}      ]    - If (gcd(a, p) > 1), then (p) is a divisor of (a). 5. **Generalizing for (a, b, c, d):**    - For (gcd(a, p) = 1), we have:      [      a^{k(p-1)+1} equiv a pmod{p}      ]    - For (gcd(a, p) > 1), (p) divides (a), so:      [      a^{k(p-1)+1} equiv 0 pmod{p}      ] 6. **Summing Up:**    Similarly, we can conclude for (b, c, d):    [    b^{k(p-1)+1} equiv b pmod{p}    ]    [    c^{k(p-1)+1} equiv c pmod{p}    ]    [    d^{k(p-1)+1} equiv d pmod{p}    ] 7. **Combining Results:**    Summing these results, we get:    [    a^{k(p-1)+1} + b^{k(p-1)+1} + c^{k(p-1)+1} + d^{k(p-1)+1} equiv a + b + c + d pmod{p}    ]    Since (p) divides (a + b + c + d), it follows that:    [    a^{k(p-1)+1} + b^{k(p-1)+1} + c^{k(p-1)+1} + d^{k(p-1)+1} equiv 0 pmod{p}    ] 8. **Conclusion:**    Therefore, for (n = k(p-1) + 1) (where (k) is any natural number), (a^n + b^n + c^n + d^n) is divisible by (p) and hence is composite.

This number of sequences is given by the Catalan number (C_n).     In our case, the provided sequence has an additional condition (x_1 + x_2 + cdots + x_{2021} = -1). This implies that (x_{2021}) must be (-1) and we rather need to check sequences of length (2020) (which is even) with equal number of 1's and -1's. 2. **Combination Count**:     - Let's denote ( S_n ) as the set of all sequences of ( n ) 1's and ( n ) -1's. Clearly, the size of ( S_n ) is given by (binom{2n}{n}) since we choose ( n ) positions out of ( 2n ) positions to place the 1's. 3. **Sequences Not Satisfying Conditions**:     - Let's denote ( A_n ) as the set of sequences within ( S_n ) that do not satisfy the given conditions. For any (sigma = x_1 x_2 cdots x_{2n} in A_n), there exists at least one position (k) such that the partial sum up to (k) is less than zero. Let (k_0) be the smallest such (k).

Take ( x = c - 2 + varepsilon ) and substitute into the given functional equation ( f(x) = f(x+2) + 2f(x^2 + 2x) ). We need to check the conditions:    [    x + 2 = c + varepsilon > c quad text{and} quad x(x + 2) = (c - 2 + varepsilon)(c + varepsilon) > c + varepsilon > c    ]    Therefore, we conclude that:    [    xf(x) = xf(x + 2) + 2xf(x^2 + 2x)    ]    Using the assumption ( xf(x) le 2021 ) for ( x > c ), we get:    [    xf(x) le x left( frac{2021}{x + 2} right) + 2x left( frac{2021}{x^2 + 2x} right) = 2021    ]    Hence, if the inequality is true for some ( x > c ), ( c ge 3 ), then it is also true for ( x > c - 2 ).

By assumption, (O_1O_2 > r_1) and (O_1P leq r_1), so (O_1O_2 > O_1P). Thus, (sin angle O_1PO_2 > sin angle O_1O_2P). 5. **Case 1**: Some angle of (triangle O_1O_2P) is greater than (120^circ). Without loss of generality, suppose (angle O_1O_2P > 120^circ). Since (sin angle O_1PO_2 > sin angle O_1O_2P = sin (180^circ - angle O_1O_2P)), we have:    [    sin angle O_1PO_2 > sin (180^circ - angle O_1O_2P) = sin angle O_1O_2P    ]    This leads to a contradiction because (angle O_1PO_2 + angle O_2O_1P > 180^circ). 6. **Case 2**: (angle O_1O_2P) and (angle O_2O_1P leq 120^circ). Without loss of generality, suppose (60^circ leq angle O_1O_2P leq 120^circ). However, this contradicts the fact that (sin angle O_1PO_2 > sin angle O_1O_2P).

However, the value of costheta is essentially being used as the angle for the sine function in sin(costheta). We need to consider where the angle costheta would fall on the unit circle. Since costheta is negative, it corresponds to an angle that would lie in either the second or third quadrant of the unit circle if we were to consider it as an angle itself. For sin(costheta) to be evaluated: - If costheta were to be considered an angle in the second quadrant, then sin(costheta) would be positive, as the sine of any angle in the second quadrant is positive.  - However, costheta is not an angle; it is the cosine of the angle theta. It is a value between -1 and 0 because costheta is negative and cannot exceed -1 in magnitude. - This means that costheta represents an angle in the fourth quadrant when we interpret it as the cosine of an angle due to the range of cosine for angles in that quadrant (-1 leq costheta leq 0). - In the fourth quadrant, the sine value is negative, as it corresponds to the vertical coordinate of the unit circle which is below the x-axis.

Therefore, the isosceles triangles Delta OA_1B_2 and Delta OC_2B_1 are also congruent by SAS congruence theorem since the angles and sides match. 7. This congruence implies that A_1B_2 = C_2B_1, thereby AB = BC. 8. By similar reasoning, we can show that BC = CD and CD = DA, thus ABCD forms a rhombus. 9.

Our goal is to find the minimum value of the sum of the absolute values of its roots. 1. **Discriminant Condition**:    Since the roots (alpha_1) and (alpha_2) are irrational, the discriminant of the quadratic polynomial must be a non-square integer:    [    D = p^2 - 4q    ]    The discriminant (D) must be a non-negative integer that is not a perfect square. 2. **Absolute Value Sum Condition**:    Consider the sum of the absolute values of the roots:    [    left|alpha_1right| + left|alpha_2right|    ] 3. **Inequality Relation**:    By utilizing the inequality involving the absolute values, we have:    [    left(left|alpha_1right| + left|alpha_2right|right)^2 geq left(alpha_1 - alpha_2right)^2    ]    Since (alpha_1) and (alpha_2) are roots of the quadratic equation, they can be expressed as:    [    alpha_1 = frac{-p + sqrt{D}}{2} quad text{and} quad alpha_2 = frac{-p - sqrt{D}}{2}    ]    Thus:    [    left(alpha_1 - alpha_2right)^2 = left(frac{-p + sqrt{D}}{2} - frac{-p - sqrt{D}}{2}right)^2 = left(frac{2sqrt{D}}{2}right)^2 = D    ] 4. **Constraint on Discriminant**:    Since (D) is a non-perfect square and (D neq 0, 1, 4), and considering (D equiv p^2 pmod{4}), we deduce that (D neq 2, 3).

We need to prove that triangle BOC is an isosceles triangle, where M is the midpoint of CD, and O is the intersection point of AC and BM. 1. **Point E on BM:**    On the line segment BM, we select a point E such that ME = MB. This places point E in such a way that M is also the midpoint of BE. 2. **Parallelogram BCED:**    In the quadrilateral BCED, since M is the midpoint of both CD and BE, and given that the diagonals of a parallelogram bisect each other, quadrilateral BCED must be a parallelogram. Therefore, DE parallel BC. As a result, point E lies on the line AD. Since E lies on both BM and AD, it confirms that E is along AD. 3. **Equality of Segments:**    Since AB = BD, and noting that AB = CE and BD = BE, we ascertain that trapezoid ABCE is isosceles. Hence, AB = CE. 4. **Angles in Isosceles Trapezoid:**    Because trapezoid ABCE is isosceles, we have:    [    angle ABC = angle BCE    ]     5. **Congruent Triangles:**    Furthermore, triangles ABC and ECB can be shown to be congruent by the Angle-Side-Angle (ASA) criterion since:    [    triangle ABC cong triangle EBC    ] 6. **Angle Equivalence:**    From the congruence of these triangles, we find:    [    angle BCA = angle CBE    ] Since AC intersects BM at point O, and point M is the midpoint of CD, triangle BOC formed has equal segments BO = OC due to symmetry in the trapezoid structure and the properties deduced.

A cheetah in cell x attacks all cells within a 19 times 19 square centered at x, excluding cells in the same row or column as x. 3. **Restrictions in a 10 times 10 Square**    Consider any 10 times 10 smaller square Q. A cheetah g in Q attacks all cells in a 19 times 19 square centered at g, except those in the same row or column as g.

The two large semicircles together form one circle with a diameter of 12 meters. Therefore, each large semicircle has a radius of 6 meters. 2. The area of one large semicircle is frac{1}{2}pi(6^2) = 18pi square meters. So, the combined area of two large semicircles is 36pi square meters. 3. The two small semicircles together form one circle with a diameter of 8 meters. Therefore, each small semicircle has a radius of 4 meters. 4.

Thus, we have:    b_{1}b_{14} = b_{2}b_{13} = b_{3}b_{12} = ldots = b_{7} cdot b_{8} = 3 2. **Applying properties of logarithms**: By the property of logarithms, summing the logarithms of products is equivalent to taking the logarithm of the product of those numbers.

In the modified version, each entry is the sum of the two directly above it plus 2, except in the second row derived from the first which maintains traditional calculations. The regular Pascal's triangle patterns result from binomial coefficients binom{n}{k}, where n is the row number, and k is the position, starting from 0. A binomial coefficient is even except when k = 0 or k = n, if and only if there's no carry in addition when written in base 2 due to power of 2 properties. In our case, starting from the third row (n=2 in traditional), each element binom{n}{k} in regular Pascal's triangle will be transformed into binom{n}{k} + 2. This shifts all numbers into the even category unless they were 1 (which only occurs at the ends). The first 30 rows are considered and if using the properties of powers of 2 and the transformation by adding 2, we see that more rows will satisfy this condition: - Row 2 becomes [1, 4, 1]. - Row 4 becomes [1, 6, 8, 6, 1]... Now we hypothesize that any row starting from n=2 in traditional Pascal, when n is a power of 2 (like 4, 8, 16), transformed rows in the modified triangle will satisfy the 'all even numbers' condition, due to their binary addition properties and the addition of 2, which just shifts odd binomial coefficients, except the first to even. Thus, rows at powers of 2 up to 16 (4, 8, 16) in the first 30 rows will satisfy this property. However, we stop if n=32, but consider until 16 for this condition.

Since c is constant and equals to 8, we can substitute it into the formula and simplify:  S = sqrt{10(10-a)(10-b)(10-8)} = sqrt{20(10-a)(10-b)}.  The maximum value of this product occurs when (10-a) and (10-b) are equal, due to the fact that the product of two numbers with a constant sum is maximized when the numbers are equal. This is an application of the arithmetic mean-geometric mean inequality, which states that for nonnegative numbers, the geometric mean is always less than or equal to the arithmetic mean. In our case, since a+b=12, we have 10-a=2+b and 10-b=2+a. Setting them equal to each other, 2+b = 2+a.

By definition of perpendicular bisector, a perpendicular bisector of a segment passes through the midpoint of the segment. Consequently, the perpendicular bisector of A B goes through the midpoint of A B, let this midpoint be denoted as M.  3.

In School A, there are 3 teachers (2 males and 1 female), and in School B, there are also 3 teachers (1 male and 2 females). Therefore, the total number of ways to select one teacher from each school is the product of the number of teachers in each school, which is 3 times 3 = 9. This gives us all possible combinations of selecting one teacher from each school. Next, we need to find the number of combinations where the selected teachers are of the same gender.

Let ( g(0) = b ), so we have    [    g(x) = ax + b.    ] 5. **Substitute Back into Original Function ( f ):**        Substituting back to the function ( f ):    [    g(z) = a log x + b,    ]    Applying to ( f ):    [    log f(x) = a log x + b implies f(x) = e^{a log x + b} = e^b x^a.    ] 6. **Consistency with Functional Equation:**    Verify consistency:    [    f(x) f(y) = e^b x^a e^b y^a = e^{2b} (xy)^a,    ]    and    [    f(frac{1}{f(xy)}) = e^b left( frac{1}{e^b (xy)^a} right) = frac{e^b}{(e^b (xy)^a)} = frac{1}{(xy)^a}.    ]    Thus,    [    f left( frac{1}{f(xy)} right) = e^b left( frac{1}{e^b (xy)^a} right) = f(x) f(y).    ] 7. **Special Cases:**    (a = 1) and ( b ) arbitrary: ( f(x) = frac{e^b}{x} ).

We connect vertex r_i to vertex c_j with an edge if the cell at the intersection of row i and column j is free. 2. **Reformulate the Problem**:    Vasya's goal can be reformulated as finding no more than 99 edges in this bipartite graph such that each vertex (either in R set or C set) remains with an even number of unmarked edges. 3. **Graph Theoretic Fact**:    We will prove a general fact: In any graph with n geq 2 vertices, it is possible to mark n-1 or fewer edges such that each vertex has an even number of unmarked edges. 4. **Induction Hypothesis**:    Assume for k < n, it is possible to mark k-1 edges so that every vertex has an even number of unmarked edges. We will show this holds for k = n. 5. **Base Case**:    For n=2, this is trivial - just mark the single edge between the two vertices (if it exists). 6. **Inductive Step**:    - If there is a vertex of degree 1, mark the only edge connected to it, then remove this vertex and edge from the graph. The remaining graph has n-1 vertices. By the induction hypothesis, in this reduced graph, we can mark n-2 edges to maintain the required parity condition.    - If there is a vertex with degree 0, simply remove it, as it does not affect the problem. 7. **Handling Cycle**:    If every vertex has a degree of at least 2, start from any vertex and traverse the edges. Since each vertex has at least degree 2, we will inevitably form a cycle. Remove the edges of the cycle from the graph, which ensures the degree of each remaining vertex retains the required even parity. 8. **Complete the Process**:    - Continue this process iteratively.    - Reduce the graph progressively, ensuring that each step remains consistent with the inductive assumption.     9. **Application to the Problem**:    Given the 50x50 grid, apply the above theorem for n = 100 vertices. Thus, Vasya can mark at most 99 edges ensuring every vertex ends up with an even number of unmarked edges. 10. **Conclusion**:    Vasya can place up to 99 new pieces such that each row and each column of the board has an even number of pieces.

Using the Binomial Theorem, we expand their fifth powers as follows:          [     (5k pm 1)^5 = (5k)^5 pm 5 cdot (5k)^4 + binom{5}{2}(5k)^3 pm binom{5}{3}(5k)^2 + 5 cdot 5k pm 1     ]          [     (5k pm 2)^5 = (5k)^5 pm 5(5k)^4 cdot 2 + binom{5}{2}(5k)^3 cdot 2^2 pm binom{5}{3}(5k)^2 cdot 2^3 + 5 cdot 5k cdot 2^4 pm 2^5     ]          - On examining these expansions, we observe that all terms except the constant term (the last term) are divisible by (25).

Then the remainders of their fifth powers mod 25 can be (1, -1, 7,) or (-7). We need to demonstrate that the sum of these remainders cannot be divisible by 25 if the sum of the five fifth powers is 25.      5. **Summing Up the Remainders:**     - The maximum absolute value of the sum of five such remainders is (5 times 7 = 35).     - The possible sums are therefore (-35) to (35).     - However, for the sum of the remainders to be exactly 0 or 25, specific conditions must be met:         - **Sum is Zero:** This is impossible since the sum consists of odd remainders which cannot sum to zero.         - **Sum is Twenty-Five:** This requires careful pairing whereby a combination of remainders such as (7, 7, 7, 7, -3) or (7, 7, 7, 1, 3) is necessary. But none forms a valid set since 3 cannot be achieved by the sum of fifth power remainders. 6. **Final Conclusion:**     - By contradiction, since it is impossible to form such a sum with the provided remainders, our assumption that none of the integers is divisible by 5 must be false.

The representation of the number  n  as a product is also considered a representation consisting of a single factor  n .","output":"To solve this problem, we need to analyze the two different ways of representing the number ( n ) and show that they yield the same number of representations. 1. **Prime Factorization Representation**:    - Andrey finds all different representations of ( n ) as a product of powers of prime numbers, where each factor is greater than or equal to the previous one.    - Let ( n ) have the prime factorization ( n = p_1^{alpha_1} cdot p_2^{alpha_2} cdots p_m^{alpha_m} ), where ( p_1, p_2, ldots, p_m ) are distinct prime numbers and ( alpha_1, alpha_2, ldots, alpha_m ) are positive integers. 2. **Divisibility Representation**:    - Petya finds all different representations of ( n ) as a product of integers greater than 1, where each factor is divisible by all the previous factors.    - This means that if ( n = b_1 cdot b_2 cdots b_k ), then ( b_1 mid b_2 mid cdots mid b_k ). 3. **Counting Representations**:    - For Andrey's representation, we need to count the number of ways to write ( n ) as a product of powers of primes, where the exponents are non-decreasing.    - For Petya's representation, we need to count the number of ways to write ( n ) as a product of integers, where each integer is divisible by the previous one. 4. **Nondecreasing Sequences**:    - The number of nondecreasing sequences of positive integers that sum to ( k ) is denoted by ( f(k) ).    - For each prime ( p_i ) with exponent ( alpha_i ), the number of ways to distribute the exponent ( alpha_i ) into nondecreasing sequences is ( f(alpha_i) ). 5. **Product of Counts**:    - The total number of representations for ( n ) in both cases is given by the product of the counts for each prime factor.    - Therefore, the number of representations for ( n ) is ( prod_{i=1}^m f(alpha_i) ). 6. **Conclusion**:    - Since both Andrey and Petya's representations are counted by the same product ( prod_{i=1}^m f(alpha_i) ), they will always find the same number of representations.    - Hence, the game will always end in a draw for any positive integer ( n ).

Since each ball can be placed in any of the 4 boxes, for each ball, there are 4 options. Thus, for 4 balls, the total number of ways is  [4 times 4 times 4 times 4 = 4^{4} = 256.] So, the total number of ways to place the balls is boxed{256}.  (2) Each box can have at most one ball, how many ways are there to place the balls? In this case, since each box must have exactly one ball, we are essentially permuting 4 distinct balls into 4 distinct boxes. The number of ways to do this is the permutation of 4 elements out of 4, which is  [A_{4}^{4} = 4! = 24.] Therefore, the total number of ways to place the balls is boxed{24}.  (3) If exactly one box is empty, how many ways are there to place the balls? First, choose 2 out of the 4 balls to be in the same box, which can be done in C_{4}^{2} ways. Then, permute the 3 remaining \\"items\\" (where one \\"item\\" is the pair of balls, and the other two are single balls) into the 3 non-empty boxes, which can be done in A_{3}^{3} ways. Therefore, the number of ways is [C_{4}^{2} times A_{3}^{3} = binom{4}{2} times 3! = 6 times 6 = 36 times 4 = 144.] Thus, the total number of ways to place the balls is boxed{144}.

Step 2: With 3 identical balls and 3 boxes where one box must contain 2 balls, and the other two each contain 1 ball, we only need to choose which box will contain the 2 balls. Since the balls are identical, this choice can be made in C_{3}^{1} = 3 ways.

We need to find the largest positive real number (x) such that for any balanced (n times n) chessboard, we can find (n) cells such that these cells all have numbers greater than or equal to (x), and no two of these cells are in the same row or column. 2. **Formulate the Answer**: The answer is (frac{1}{left(frac{n+1}{2}right)^2}) if (n) is odd and (frac{1}{frac{n}{2} cdot left(frac{n}{2}+1right)}) if (n) is even. 3. **Construct the Chessboard**:    - Let (x = lceil frac{n+1}{2} rceil) and (y = lfloor frac{n+1}{2} rfloor). Then (x + y = n + 1).    - Define (a_{i,j}) as the cell on the (i)-th row and (j)-th column, where (a_{1,1}) denotes the top left corner.    - Assign values to the cells as follows:      [      a_{i,j} =       begin{cases}       0 & text{if } i < y text{ and } j < x       frac{1}{x} & text{if } i ge y text{ and } j < x       frac{1}{y} & text{if } i < y text{ and } j ge x       frac{1}{xy} & text{if } i ge y text{ and } j ge x       end{cases}      ] 4. **Proof of Optimality**:    - Consider a bipartite graph ((R, C)) where (R) is the set of rows and (C) is the set of columns. Row (i) and column (j) are adjacent with an edge if (a_{i,j} ge frac{1}{xy}).    - By Hall's Marriage Theorem, it suffices to show that for every (X subset R) of rows, (|N(X)| ge |X|). 5. **Contradiction Argument**:    - Assume for contradiction that there exists a set of (m) rows (call them (r_1, ldots, r_m)) such that (|N(X)| le m - 1).    - This implies there are at least (n + 1 - m) columns (call them (c_1, ldots, c_{n+1-m})) such that (a_{j,k} < frac{1}{xy}) for every (1 le j le m) and (1 le k le n + 1 - m).    - Let (S) be the set of squares in the intersection of these (n + 1 - m) columns and (m) rows. The sum of values of squares in (S) is at most ((n + 1 - m)m frac{1}{xy} < 1), and equality cannot hold.    - Let (T) be the set of squares in the intersection of these (m) rows but the other (m - 1) columns. Since (S) and (T) form (m) rows, the sum of values of squares in (S) plus the sum of values of squares in (T) is exactly (m). It follows that the sum of numbers in squares (S) is greater than (m - 1). However, (S) is a subset of (m - 1) columns, which is a contradiction.

Therefore, the assumption that the first person is telling the truth leads to a contradiction. Thus, the first person must be a liar. If the first person is a liar, both of his statements must be false:    - The statement \\"There are no more than three people here\\" is false, which means there are more than three people in the room.    - The statement \\"All of us are liars\\" is false, meaning not all people in the room are liars. 2. **Second person's statements:**    - \\"There are no more than four people here.\\"    - \\"Not all of us are liars.\\"    Assume the second person is telling the truth:    - The statement \\"There are no more than four people here\\" indicates that at most four people are in the room.    - The statement \\"Not all of us are liars\\" is consistent with the situation where not everyone in the room is a liar.    Combining this information with the result from analyzing the first person, we have:    - There are more than three people in the room.    - There are no more than four people in the room.        Hence, there must be exactly four people in the room. 3. **Third person's statements:**    - \\"There are five of us here.\\"    - \\"Three of us are liars.\\"    Given our previous analysis that there are exactly four people in the room, the statement \\"There are five of us here\\" must be false. Thus, the third person must be a liar. If the third person is a liar, then both of his statements must be false:    - The statement \\"There are five of us here\\" is indeed false.    - The statement \\"Three of us are liars\\" is also false, so there cannot be three liars. Since we have already identified the first and third persons as liars, this leaves only the second person as a truth-teller.

This includes Class 6 winning two rounds, Class 18 winning one round, and Class 6 winning the last round, and vice versa for Class 18. The probability for X=4 is: P(X=4) = frac{132}{625} + frac{108}{625} = frac{240}{625} = frac{48}{125} - For X=5, the game ends after all five rounds, which means: P(X=5) = 1 - P(X=3) - P(X=4) = 1 - frac{4}{25} - frac{48}{125} = frac{57}{125} Now, we calculate the expected value E(X): E(X) = 3 cdot frac{4}{25} + 4 cdot frac{48}{125} + 5 cdot frac{57}{125} = frac{537}{125} Hence, the expected value of the random variable X is boxed{frac{537}{125}}."},{"instruction":"What is the remainder when 7459 is divided by 9?","output":"1.

If the car travels at 120 km/h, the train travels 50% faster, which means the train's speed is 120 km/h + (50% of 120 km/h). 50% of 120 km/h is 0.5 * 120 km/h = 60 km/h. So, the train's speed is 120 km/h + 60 km/h = 180 km/h. Now, let's calculate the time it takes for the car to travel 75 km without any stops. The time is distance divided by speed. Time for the car = Distance / Speed = 75 km / 120 km/h = 0.625 hours. Since both the train and the car reach point B at the same time, the train also takes 0.625 hours to cover the 75 km if it did not stop at any stations.

Now, let's check which given function value does not satisfy this equation:    - For x=-1, y=3(-1)+5=3-5=2, which matches the given value.    - For x=0, y=3(0)+5=0+5=5, which matches the given value.    - For x=1, y=3(1)+5=3+5=8, which matches the given value.    - For x=2, y=3(2)+5=6+5=11, which does not match the given value of 12.    - For x=3, y=3(3)+5=9+5=14, which matches the given value. Therefore, the incorrect function value is boxed{12}, which corresponds to choice boxed{C}."},{"instruction":"Points P, Q, R, and S are in space such that each of overline{SP}, overline{SQ}, and overline{SR} is perpendicular to the other two.

The area of right triangle SPQ with legs of length 10 each is (10)(10)/2 = 50 square units. Thus, the volume of the pyramid with base SPQ and height 8 is: [ text{Volume} = frac{1}{3}(text{Area of } SPQ)(SR) = frac{1}{3}(50)(8) = frac{400}{3} text{ cubic units}. ] Letting the distance from S to face PQR be d. The volume of SPQR can also be expressed as frac{d}{3}([PQR]). Hence,  [ frac{d}{3}([PQR]) = frac{400}{3}, ] which simplifies to [ d = frac{400}{[PQR]}. ] Applying the Pythagorean Theorem to triangles SPQ, SPR, and SQR, we find: [ PQ = 10sqrt{2}, quad PR = QR = sqrt{10^2 + 8^2} = sqrt{164} = 2sqrt{41}. ] Triangle PQR is isosceles with PR = QR. The altitude from R to overline{PQ} bisects overline{PQ}, so PM = 5sqrt{2}.

Let ( S ) denote the unique set of integers such that     [    sum limits_{n in S} 2^n = sqrt{d}    ]    This means that the binary representation of (sqrt{d}) can be expressed as a sum of distinct powers of 2. 2. Let the number of digits of (sqrt{d}) before the decimal point be (chi). Therefore, (sqrt{d} < 2^{chi+1}). 3. Consider the number ( v ) obtained by taking the first (chi + ell) digits of (sqrt{d}), where (ell geq chi). Note that     [    v = frac{ lfloor 2^{ell} sqrt{d} rfloor}{2^{ell}} = sqrt{d} - frac{ { 2^{ell} sqrt{d} } }{2^{ell}}    ]    Here, ({ x }) denotes the fractional part of (x). 4.

The second term above is strictly less than ( frac{1}{4^{ell}} ), and hence in its binary representation, the first (2ell) digits after the decimal point are zero. The third term is less than (frac{1}{2^{ell-chi-2}}), and thus in its binary representation, the first (ell-chi-2) digits are zero. 6. Since (2ell geq ell-chi-2) and the second term is smaller than the third, it follows that (v^2) has at least (ell-chi-2) bits after the decimal point set to one. 7. We will now use the following lemma:    **Lemma:** Suppose that (m) is a rational number that has a finite binary expansion. Further, let (S) be a multiset of integers such that     [    sum limits_{n in S} 2^n = m    ]    Then (|S| geq s_2(m)).    **Proof:** This is easy to prove. While (S) has two equal elements, we may combine them and reduce the size of (S) by one. Since the final set (S) must exactly be the binary expansion of (m), we obtain that (|S| geq s_2(m)), as claimed. 8. Note that (s_2(v^2) geq ell-chi-2). Moreover, we may write (v^2) as:    [    sum limits_{u in S, u geq -ell} 2^{2u} + sum limits_{u > v geq -ell, u, v in S} 2^{u+v+1}    ]    We are using exactly (binom{s(chi+ell) + 1}{2}) powers of two in the representation above. From the lemma, we therefore obtain     [    binom{s(chi+ell) + 1}{2} geq ell-chi-2    ] 9. Write (N = chi + ell). The above yields     [    (s(N)+1)^2 > 2N-4chi-2    ]    This can easily be seen to imply (s(N) > sqrt{2N} - 2) for all large (N).

The greatest common divisor (GCD) of ( d_i ) and ( d_{i+1} ), denoted ( (d_i, d_{i+1}) ), satisfies the inequality:    [    (d_i, d_{i+1}) leq d_{i+1} - d_i.    ]    Let's denote ( r_i = d_{i+1} - d_i ) for ( i = 1, 2, ldots, s-1 ). 3. By problem conditions, we have:    [    sum_{i=1}^{s-1} r_i = d_s - d_1 = N - 1,    ]    and    [    sum_{i=1}^{s-1} (d_i, d_{i+1}) = N - 2.    ] 4. Subtracting these two equations gives:    [    sum_{i=1}^{s-1} r_i - sum_{i=1}^{s-1} (d_i, d_{i+1}) = (N-1) - (N-2) = 1.    ]    Thus,    [    sum_{i=1}^{s-1} [d_{i+1} - d_i - (d_i, d_{i+1})] = 1.    ] 5. This means that for some ( k ), we have:    [    d_{k+1} - d_k - (d_k, d_{k+1}) = 1,    ]    and for all other ( i ), ( d_{i+1} - d_i = (d_i, d_{i+1}) ). 6. The left-hand side,     [    d_{k+1} - d_k - (d_k, d_{k+1}) = 1,    ]    must be divisible by ( (d_k, d_{k+1}) ). This implies ( (d_k, d_{k+1}) = 1 ) and ( d_{k+1} - d_k = 2 ). 7. This can only occur if both ( d_k ) and ( d_{k+1} ) are odd numbers. 8. Since ( (d_{i+1} = frac{N}{d_i}) ) must also be a divisor of ( N ):    - If ( frac{N}{d_{k+1}} = d_m ), then ( frac{N}{d_k} = d_{m+1} ).    - Given ( (d_m, d_{m+1}) = frac{N}{(d_k, d_{k+1})} = frac{N}{1} = N ), the inequality confirms that ( N ) must be odd. 9. Considering the constraints, let us try small odd numbers for ( N ). 10. For ( N = 3 ):     - The divisors are ( 1 ) and ( 3 ).     - The sequence ([1, 3]) satisfies ( d_1 = 1 ) and ( d_2 = 3 ).     - Calculating the GCD for any adjacent pairs, ( (1, 3) = 1 ).     - Summing these gives ( sum (1, 3) = 1 ), further ( 3 - 1 = 2 ).

To ensure ( p ) remains a prime, the only possibility is:    [    a - b = 1    ]    This is because ( a ) and ( b ) are positive integers and ( a - b ) must be non-negative. The expression thus simplifies to:    [    p = (a - b)(a^2 + ab + b^2) = 1 cdot (a^2 + ab + b^2)    ]    Therefore:    [    p = a^2 + ab + b^2    ] 3.

First, let's find the LCM of 29, 37, and 43. Since these numbers are all prime, the LCM is simply their product: LCM(29, 37, 43) = 29 * 37 * 43 Now, let's calculate the product: LCM(29, 37, 43) = 29 * 37 * 43 LCM(29, 37, 43) = 45653 The LCM of 29, 37, and 43 is 45653.

Our goal is to ensure that for any subset of five numbers ( {a_{i_1}, a_{i_2}, a_{i_3}, a_{i_4}, a_{i_5}} ) from this set, the product ( a_{i_1} times a_{i_2} times a_{i_3} times a_{i_4} times a_{i_5} ) is divisible by the sum ( a_{i_1} + a_{i_2} + a_{i_3} + a_{i_4} + a_{i_5} ). 2. **Construction of the Set**:    We will construct a set to meet the given condition. First, take any arbitrary set of 100 different natural numbers ( {a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{100}} ). Denote any subset of 5 numbers from this set as ( {a_{i_1}, a_{i_2}, a_{i_3}, a_{i_4}, a_{i_5}} ). 3. **Defining a Common Multiple**:    Let ( S ) be the sum of all possible distinct combinations of any 5 elements (i.e., pentads) chosen from the initial set, calculated as:    [    S = sum_{{i_1, i_2, i_3, i_4, i_5}} (a_{i_1} + a_{i_2} + a_{i_3} + a_{i_4} + a_{i_5})    ]        Calculate the product of numbers in a typical set of five ( {a_{i_1}, a_{i_2}, a_{i_3}, a_{i_4}, a_{i_5}} ):    [    P = a_{i_1} times a_{i_2} times a_{i_3} times a_{i_4} times a_{i_5}    ] 4. **Scaling the Set**:     We scale each element in the set ( {a_1, a_2, ldots, a_{100}} ) by multiplying each element by ( S ). This gives us a new set ( {S times a_1, S times a_2, ldots, S times a_{100}} ). 5. **Verification**:    Now consider any five elements from the scaled set: ( {S times a_{i_1}, S times a_{i_2}, S times a_{i_3}, S times a_{i_4}, S times a_{i_5}} ).    - The product of these five elements is:      [      P' = (S times a_{i_1}) times (S times a_{i_2}) times (S times a_{i_3}) times (S times a_{i_4}) times (S times a_{i_5}) = S^5 times P      ]    - The sum of these five elements is:      [      sigma' = S times (a_{i_1} + a_{i_2} + a_{i_3} + a_{i_4} + a_{i_5}) = S times sigma      ]      where ( sigma ) is the sum of the five original numbers.    Since ( S ) is defined to be the summation of all such sums over all combinations of five elements, ( sigma ) divides ( S ).    Therefore, ( sigma' ) divides ( S^5 times P ).

Analogous to above, ( g(m, n) equiv 2 pmod{3} ) and ( 4 mid g(m, n) ). Thus, the only possible case to rule out is ( g(m, n) = 8 ). 11.

Prove that some four of them are mutually acquainted.","output":"1. **Recognize the structure of the problem:** We are given a group of nine men in a room such that among every three of them, there are at least two who are mutually acquainted. We need to prove that there exists a group of four men who are all mutually acquainted. 2. **Invoke the Ramsey theory principle:** The problem hints at an application of Ramsey theory, particularly within graph theory. According to Ramsey's theorem, for any graph, there is a minimum number of vertices such that any edge coloring will result in a monochromatic complete subgraph of a specified size. Specifically, (R(3,3) = 6), which means among six people, there must be a subset of three who are either all mutually acquainted or all mutually unacquainted. Given our condition, the latter subset (all mutually unacquainted) is excluded by the problem's conditions. 3. **Restate the problem with graph theory terminology:**     - There are 9 vertices (men).     - An edge exists between any two vertices if the corresponding men are acquainted.     - For any three vertices, at least two have an edge between them. 4. **Consider implications if a vertex has at most four edges:**     - If any man is not acquainted with five or more others, consider such a man (A).     - Let (B_1, B_2, B_3, B_4, B_5) be men who are not acquainted with (A) (as (A) is not acquainted with these five). 5. **Force mutual acquaintance among these five:**     - Let (G = {B_1, B_2, B_3, B_4, B_5}).      - By the condition, in any trio of men, at least two must be acquainted. Since (A) is excluded, this property must hold within (G), creating a subgraph where each subset of three men within (G) has at least two who know each other. 6. **Returning to (G), further analyze mutual acquaintance:**     - If each man in (G) had fewer than three acquaintances among (G), they would form a subset where a trio could exist without mutual acquaintances, contradicting our initial condition. Thus, in (G), each must have at least three acquaintances. 7. **Final step for contradiction method:**     - Assume no such subset of four globally mutually acquainted men exists. Every man in (G) is acquainted with at least three, and by extension from Step 6, each graph configuration drives a subgraph akin to (K_4) indicating the very contradiction to our assumption - thus ensuring at least one four-man fully acquainted subset. 8. **Conclusion:** Since either of these cases within G directly interconnects and with R(3,3) theorem enforcement, a universal four-man group must be interconnected. Therefore, we have demonstrated that there exists a group of four men who know each other.

The goal is to determine the parity (even or odd) of the number of adjacent cell-pairs with different colors. 2. **Score Definition:**    Assign a score to each cell: 1 if the cell is black and 0 if the cell is white. For any two adjacent cells, the Oracle provides the parity of the sum of their scores, i.e., (u + v pmod{2}), where (u) and (v) are the scores of the two adjacent cells. 3. **Objective:**    The Guesser needs to compute the parity of the sum of the scores of all adjacent cell-pairs.

On Pat's turn, he transforms the number ( y ) into ( y + 2019 ). We need to determine the smallest ( N ) such that none of the numbers obtained during the game is divisible by ( 2018 ). 4. First, consider the number after Mary's first turn:    [    N_1 = 2017N + 2    ]    We need ( N_1 notequiv 0 pmod{2018} ). 5.

What is the minimum number of candies that could have originally been in the can?","output":"Let's denote the original number of red candies as ( c ) and the original number of green candies as ( z ). 1. Čeněk ate (frac{2}{5}) of the red candies, so (frac{3}{5}c) red candies are left. 2. Zuzka ate (frac{3}{5}) of the green candies, so (frac{2}{5}z) green candies are left. 3. The red candies constitute (frac{3}{8}) of all the candies left in the can. Using these facts, we can construct the following equation for the total number of remaining candies: [ frac{3}{5}c = frac{3}{8} left( frac{3}{5}c + frac{2}{5}z right) ] To clear the fractions, multiply through by 40: [ 40 cdot frac{3}{5}c = 40 cdot frac{3}{8} left( frac{3}{5}c + frac{2}{5}z right) ] Simplify: [ 24c = 15 left( frac{3}{5}c + frac{2}{5}z right) ] Distribute (15): [ 24c = 9c + 6z ] Subtract (9c) from both sides: [ 15c = 6z ] Divide both sides by 3: [ 5c = 2z ] Thus, the original number of red candies (c) is related to the original number of green candies (z) by: [ c = frac{2z}{5} ] Since both (c) and (z) must be integers, (z) must be a multiple of 5. Let's start with the smallest possible multiples: 1. If ( z = 5 ):    [ c = frac{2 cdot 5}{5} = 2 ]    Not an integer. 2. If ( z = 10 ):    [ c = frac{2 cdot 10}{5} = 4 ]    Not an integer. 3.

If ( z = 25 ):    [ c = frac{2 cdot 25}{5} = 10 ]    This is the smallest integral solution. Therefore, with ( c = 10 ) and ( z = 25 ): - Čeněk leaves (frac{3}{5} times 10 = 6) red candies. - Zuzka leaves (frac{2}{5} times 25 = 10) green candies. So, the total number of candies left is ( 6 + 10 = 16 ), and red candies form (frac{3}{8}) of all the candies left: [ frac{6}{16} = frac{3}{8} ] Thus, the solution holds.

Solving each factor, we have:    - x - 2y = 0 implies x = 2y    - x + 2y = 0 implies x = -2y 4. **Graph Interpretation**:      These equations mean the graph consists of two lines intersecting at the origin, with slopes 2 and -2, which indeed are the definitions for a pair of intersecting lines. 5. **Conclusion**:      The graph of 3x^2 - 12y^2 = 0 is a pair of intersecting straight lines.

Given that (S-ABC) is a regular tetrahedron with height (SO = 3) and the base edge length is 6. We need to find the parallel cross-section area passing through a point (P) such that (AP: PO' = 8), where (O') is the foot of the perpendicular from (A) to the face (SBC). 2. Since (S-ABC) is a regular tetrahedron, (O) is the centroid of (triangle ABC). We know that in a regular tetrahedron, the centroid of any face acts as the foot of the perpendicular from the opposing vertex. 3. Connect (A) to (O) and extend it to intersect (BC) at point (D). Point (D) is the midpoint of (BC). Thus, (A, O, D) are collinear.         Hence,        AD = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} cdot BC = frac{sqrt{3}}{2} cdot 6 = 3sqrt{3}        where (AD) is two-thirds of the median from vertex (A) in (triangle ABC). 4. Since (O) divides (AD) in the ratio (1:2),        OD = frac{1}{3} AD = frac{1}{3} times 3sqrt{3} = sqrt{3}     5. To find (SD), we use the Pythagorean theorem in (triangle SOD):        SD = sqrt{SO^2 + OD^2} = sqrt{3^2 + (sqrt{3})^2} = sqrt{9 + 3} = 2sqrt{3}     6. Since (O') lies on (DS), using the section formula, since (O') divides (AD) in the given ratio, we can find:        O'D = frac{OD}{SD} cdot AD = frac{sqrt{3}}{2sqrt{3}} cdot 3sqrt{3} = frac{3sqrt{3}}{2}     7. Let’s denote the intersection of our desired plane and (SD) as (O'').     Since (AP: PO' = 8), the division ratio is akin to finding that (P) divided the height proportionally:        frac{AP}{PO'} = 8 implies frac{O''D}{AD} = frac{8}{9}     8. Calculating (O''D), we have:        O''D = frac{8}{9} times O'D = frac{8}{9} times frac{3sqrt{3}}{2} = frac{4sqrt{3}}{3}     9. Now, the height from (S) to the new plane is:        SC'' = SD - O''D = 2sqrt{3} - frac{4sqrt{3}}{3} = frac{6sqrt{3} - 4sqrt{3}}{3} = frac{2sqrt{3}}{3}     10. The given cross-section ((A'',B'',C'')) forms another triangle similar to (triangle ABC), with area ratio in proportion to the squares of the heights.     Thus the area of the cross-section is:          frac{(SC'')^2}{(SD)^2} = frac{(frac{2sqrt{3}}{3})^2}{(2sqrt{3})^2} = frac{frac{4 cdot 3}{9}}{4 cdot 3} = frac{1}{9}      11.

For all n vertices, the sum of these straight angles is:    [    180^circ times n    ] 5. Using the formula for the sum of interior angles, we recall:    [    text{Sum of interior angles} = 180^circ n - 360^circ    ]    Note that, rearranging this equation, we obtain:    [    180^circ n = text{Sum of interior angles} + 360^circ    ] 6. The sum of the exterior angles can be thought of as the total angles around a point (one full rotation) minus the sum of the interior angles:    [    text{Sum of exterior angles} = 180^circ n - 180^circ (n-2)    ]     7. Simplifying the above expression:    [    text{Sum of exterior angles} = 180^circ n - 180^circ n + 360^circ = 360^circ    ] 8.

There are 3! = 6 permutations of the balls, and each permutation will result in a unique painting method.

We need to mark points Y and Z on edges mathrm{CC}_1 and mathrm{A}_1 mathrm{D}_1 respectively, in such a way that triangle mathrm{XYZ} is equilateral.  1. **Establishing the Position of Point X**:    - Given that X divides mathrm{AB} in the ratio 1:2 from A, let the edge length of the cube be a.    - Therefore, mathrm{XA} = frac{a}{3} and mathrm{XB} = frac{2a}{3}. 2. **Finding Points Y and Z**:    - Mark the point Z on mathrm{A}_1 mathrm{D}_1 such that mathrm{A}_1 mathrm{Z} : mathrm{ZD}_1 = 2 : 1. Hence, mathrm{A}_1 mathrm{Z} = frac{2a}{3} and mathrm{ZD}_1 = frac{a}{3}.    - Similarly, mark point Y on mathrm{CC}_1 such that mathrm{C}_1 mathrm{Y} : mathrm{YC} = 2 : 1. Thus, mathrm{C}_1 mathrm{Y} = frac{2a}{3} and mathrm{YC} = frac{a}{3}. 3. **Verification of Triangle XYZ being Equilateral**:    - Each segment mathrm{XA}, mathrm{ZD}_1, and mathrm{YC} equals frac{a}{3}.    - Each segment mathrm{AA}_1, mathrm{D}_1mathrm{C}_1, and mathrm{CB} equals a.    - Each segment mathrm{A}_1 mathrm{Z}, mathrm{C}_1 mathrm{Y}, and mathrm{BX} equals frac{2a}{3}. 4. **Evaluation of the Lengths of Edges of Triangle XYZ**:    - For  triangle mathrm{XBC}, Delta mathrm{YC}_1 mathrm{D}_1, Delta mathrm{ZA}_{1} mathrm{~A}, these are right-angled triangles with equal lengths of the legs, which implies that:      [      mathrm{XC} = mathrm{YD}_1 = mathrm{ZA}      ]    - The face diagonal length mathrm{XY} using Pythagoras theorem in the right triangle mathrm{XCY}:      [      mathrm{XY} = sqrt{left(frac{a}{3}right)^2 + left(frac{2a}{3}right)^2} = sqrt{frac{a^2}{9} + frac{4a^2}{9}} = sqrt{frac{5a^2}{9}} = frac{sqrt{5}a}{3}      ]    - Thus, the length mathrm{XY} equals the same as mathrm{YZ} and mathrm{ZX} making the triangle mathrm{XYZ} equilateral due to:      [      mathrm{XY} = mathrm{YZ} = mathrm{ZX} = frac{sqrt{5}a}{3}      ] **Conclusion**:  We completed the step-by-step proof showing that triangle mathrm{XYZ} is equilateral when points Y and Z are marked as described. Ensuring that XA = frac{a}{3}, ZD_{1} = frac{a}{3}, and YC = frac{a}{3} and the rest of the calculations ensure the triangle remains equilateral.

Next, let's investigate each answer option. A: For a + b to be perpendicular to c = (0,1), their dot product should be zero:  (a + b) cdot c = (0, 1+x^2) cdot (0,1) = 0 times 0 + (1+x^2) times 1 = 1 + x^2.

Since a+b=(0, 1 + x^2) only has a second component and c=(0,1) only has a second non-zero component as well, a+b can be considered as a scalar multiple of c.

Since -(1+x^2) is always negative for any real x, this dot product cannot be zero; hence, a + b cannot be perpendicular to d. D: For a + b to be parallel to d = (1,-1), one should be a scalar multiple of the other. However, since a + b has a zero for its first component and a positive second component, while d has non-zero and differing signs for both components, they cannot be scalar multiples of each other.

Without loss of generality, assume ( p ) divides ( (m - n) ). Let:    [    m - n = p cdot a    ]    for some integer ( a ).

Notice that ( a ) must be a divisor of ( n ) because ( n^2 ) is involved. Let ( a = frac{n}{b} ) for some integer ( b ). Then:    [    frac{n}{b} (2n + p cdot frac{n}{b}) = k cdot n^2    ]    Simplifying, we get:    [    frac{n}{b} (2n + frac{pn}{b}) = k cdot n^2    ]    [    frac{n}{b} cdot frac{2bn + pn}{b} = k cdot n^2    ]    [    frac{n (2bn + pn)}{b^2} = k cdot n^2    ]    [    frac{2bn^2 + p n^2}{b^2} = k cdot n^2    ]    [    frac{n^2 (2b + p)}{b^2} = k cdot n^2    ]    [    frac{2b + p}{b^2} = k    ] 7. **Determine the uniqueness of ( d ):**    Since ( p ) is a prime number and ( p > 2 ), the equation ( frac{2b + p}{b^2} = k ) has only one solution for ( b ) that satisfies the equation for a given ( n ) and ( p ). Therefore, there is only one possible value for ( d ). (blacksquare)"},{"instruction":"Mork pays a tax rate of 40% on his income, while Mindy pays a rate of some percentage on hers.

Percent Increase = [(S' - S) / S] * 100% Substitute S' with S * (10/9): Percent Increase = [(S * (10/9) - S) / S] * 100% Percent Increase = [(10S/9 - S) / S] * 100% Percent Increase = [(10S - 9S) / (9S)] * 100% Percent Increase = [S / (9S)] * 100% Percent Increase = (1/9) * 100% Percent Increase = 11.11% Therefore, the average employee salary was increased by approximately boxed{11.11%} ."},{"instruction":"Let (mathbf{u}) and (mathbf{v}) be nonzero vectors such that [ |mathbf{u}| = 3, quad |mathbf{v}| = 3, quad |mathbf{u} + mathbf{v}| = 3. ] Find the angle between (mathbf{u}) and (mathbf{v}), in degrees.","output":"Let (d = |mathbf{u}| = |mathbf{v}| = |mathbf{u} + mathbf{v}| = 3.)

First, we find the total number of ways to distribute all books without any restriction. Since there are 4 options (students) for each of the 5 books, this can be done in 4^5 ways. Next, we subtract the distributions where at least one student does not get any book. For any given student, the number of ways for that student to get no books is (4-1)^5 = 3^5. However, since there are 4 students, we multiply this by 4, getting 4 cdot 3^5. We are overcounting the cases where exactly two students get no books. We choose 2 out of 4 students in binom{4}{2} ways, and distribute the books among the remaining 2 students in 2^5 ways. Therefore, we add back binom{4}{2} cdot 2^5. For cases where exactly three students get no books, we've subtracted them three times (one for each student being considered in the second step) and added them back three times in the third step. Therefore, we don't need to adjust for these cases as they have already been excluded. Since it's impossible for all four students to receive no books when all 5 books are being distributed, we don't need to consider this scenario.

Consider the number (10! = 3628800).     - It is divisible by 10. If we change any digit except the last one, the divisibility by 10 persists. This means that the resulting number cannot end in a prime digit and hence cannot be prime.     - If we replace the last digit (0) with any digit from 1 to 9, the resulting number will be of the form (10k + m), where (k) is an integer and (m) is one of {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}. Since (10!) is divisible by 10, the new number is still divisible by the last digit and thus not prime.     - If the last digit is replaced by 1, the resulting number is (3628801), which is divisible by 11.          Therefore, we cannot obtain a prime number by changing one digit in (10!). 2. Consider the number ((10!)^3).     - If any digit except the last digit is altered, the reasoning from the first example applies, i.e., divisibility arguments prevent the number from being prime.     - If the last digit is changed from 0 to 1, the number would be ((10!)^3 + 1). We use the identity:       [       (10! + 1)((10!)^2 - 10! + 1) = (10!)^3 + 1       ]       Here, ((10!)^2 - 10! + 1) is another factor of ((10!)^3 + 1), hence making it a composite number.          Therefore, altering one digit in ((10!)^3) cannot produce a prime. 3. Consider the number (19! + 10).     - As in the cases above, altering any digit except the last one keeps the properties of the number such that it remains composite.     - If the last digit (which is 0) is replaced with 1 to 9, the resultant number takes the form (10k + m). Still not prime due to similar divisibility issues discussed in the earlier examples.          Thus, altering one digit in (19! + 10) consistently fails to achieve a prime number.

These setups simplify the calculations due to the right angle at ( C ). 3. **Centers of Circles:**    The respective coordinates of the circle centers are:    - Orthocenter/Circumcenter: Since ( angle C = 90^circ ), it is at the midpoint of hypotenuse ( AB ), so:      [      left(frac{0 + 2a}{2}, frac{0 + 2b}{2}right) = (a, b)      ]    - Incircle center: For a right triangle, its center is:      [      left( r, r right)      ]      where ( r ) can be expressed as ( r = a + b - R ). 4. **Homothety Transformation:**    Under the homothety with center ( C ) and ratio 2, the new coordinates of the incircle center will be:    [    (2r, 2r)    ] 5. **Distance Calculation:**    Using the distance formula, the distance ( d ) from the circumcenter ( (a, b) ) to the new incircle center ( (2r, 2r) ):    [    d = sqrt{(2r - a)^2 + (2r - b)^2}    ] 6. **Expansion and Simplification:**    Expand the squared terms:    [    d^2 = (2r-a)^2 + (2r-b)^2    ]    [    = (4r^2 - 4ar + a^2) + (4r^2 - 4br + b^2)    ]    [    = 4r^2 - 4ar + a^2 + 4r^2 - 4br + b^2    ]    [    = 8r^2 - 4r(a + b) + a^2 + b^2    ] 7. **Using ( R ) Relationships:**    We know:    [    a^2 + b^2 = R^2    ]    Hence:    [    d^2 = 8r^2 - 4r(a + b) + R^2    ]    Considering:    [    r = a + b - R    ]    Substitute ( r ):    [    d^2 = 8(a+b-R)^2 - 4(a+b-R)(a+b) + R^2    ] 8. **Further Expansion and Simplification:**    Next, substituting the value of ( r ):    [    r = a + b - R    ]    simplifies to:    [    R^{2}=d^2 + 4r^{2} + 4rR - 8rr    ] 9. **Solving for ( R ):**    Eventually, we conclude:    [    R = d + 2r    ] This confirms that homothety with center ( C ) and coefficient 2 transforms the incircle into a circle that touches the circumcircle.

The midpoint (x_m, y_m) is given by: x_m = (2 + (-2)) / 2 = 0 y_m = (0 + y) / 2 = y / 2 Since the center of the circle is on the x-axis (because the radius is the maximum possible value and the point (2,0) is on the circle), the y-coordinate of the center must be 0.

Given that every two people have exactly one friend in common, this implies that for any two vertices ( u ) and ( v ), there exists exactly one vertex ( w ) such that both ( u ) and ( v ) are adjacent to ( w ). 2. **Vertex with Maximum Degree**: Let ( v_1 ) be a vertex with the maximum degree in ( G ). Let the neighbors of ( v_1 ) be ( v_3, v_4, ldots, v_k ). This means ( v_1 ) is connected to ( k-2 ) other vertices. 3. **Existence of Non-Neighbor**: Assume there exists a vertex ( v_2 ) that is not a neighbor of ( v_1 ). By the problem's condition, ( v_1 ) and ( v_2 ) must have exactly one common friend. Let this common friend be ( v_3 ).

Therefore, the degree of ( v_2 ) is ( k-1 ). 7. **Contradiction**: Since ( v_1 ) was chosen as the vertex with the maximum degree, the degree of ( v_2 ) cannot exceed the degree of ( v_1 ). However, if ( v_2 ) has a degree of ( k-1 ), it contradicts the assumption that ( v_1 ) has the maximum degree unless ( v_2 ) is also a neighbor of ( v_1 ). 8. **Conclusion**: Therefore, the assumption that there exists a vertex ( v_2 ) not connected to ( v_1 ) leads to a contradiction.

Recall that a function ( f ) is convex on an interval if, for any ( x_1, x_2 in [a, b] ) and ( lambda in [0, 1] ), the following inequality holds: [ f(lambda x_1 + (1 - lambda) x_2) leq lambda f(x_1) + (1 - lambda) f(x_2). ]  Step 2: Specify the Points and Weights Consider arbitrary distinct points ( x_1, x_2, ldots, x_n ) from the interval ([a, b]) and arbitrary positive weights ( m_1, m_2, ldots, m_n ).

To do this, we analyze the given conditions using the Chinese Remainder Theorem.  Step-by-Step Analysis: 1. **Understanding the Problem**:    We are provided with the following congruences:    [    begin{aligned}    x & equiv 1 pmod{2},    x & equiv 2 pmod{3},    x & equiv 3 pmod{5}.    end{aligned}    ]    We need to find ( x pmod{30} ). 2. **Applying the Chinese Remainder Theorem**:    We will solve these congruences step-by-step.

From angle chasing, we have (angle DCX' + angle CX'A = 90^circ), which implies (X'A perp CD).    - Since (CA = AD), (X'A) is the perpendicular bisector of (CD). Therefore,      [      angle X'DB = angle X'DA = angle X'CA = angle X'CB      ]    - Thus, (DCBX') is cyclic. Similarly, we can prove that (ECAX') is cyclic. Therefore, (X = X'). 2. **Claim 2: (X) is the circumcenter of (triangle DCE)**    - Since (X) is the (C)-excenter, (XA) is the perpendicular bisector of (CD) and (XB) is the perpendicular bisector of (CE). 3. **Define (O) as the circumcenter of (triangle ABC), (T) as the midpoint of arc (widehat{AB}) not containing (C), and (Z) as the reflection of (X) with respect to line (AB)**    - By Claim 2, we have (XY = XC), hence (XO) is the perpendicular bisector of (CY). 4. **Claim 3: (T, Z, Y) are collinear**    - Define (F = ZT cap AB) and (G) such that (GT) is tangent to (odot(ABC)) and (A, G) lie on the same side of (CX).    - To prove the claim, we need to show that (angle ZTG = angle YTG). Note that      [      angle ZTG = angle ZFA = 90^circ - angle XZT      ]      and      [      angle YTG = angle YCT = angle YCX = 90^circ - angle OXC      ]    - We need to prove that (angle XZT = angle OXC). Using complex numbers, we assign (a = p^2, b = q^2, c = r^2) with (|p| = |q| = |r| = 1). It's easy to check that (t = -pq) and (x = qr + pr - pq). (Z) is the reflection of (X) with respect to line (AB), so      [      z = a + b - ab overline{x} = p^2 + q^2 - p^2q^2 left(frac{1}{qr} + frac{1}{pr} - frac{1}{pq}right) = frac{p^2r + q^2r - p^2q - pq^2 + pqr}{r}      ]    - It suffices to prove that (measuredangle CXO = measuredangle XZT), which is equivalent to (frac{o - x}{c - x} : frac{t - z}{x - z} in mathbb{R}).

Moreover, because (T, Y in odot(ABC)) and they are on different sides of (AB), (F) must lie on segment (AB). 6. **Claim 4: The condition (DY + EY = 2XY) implies (Y = Z)**    - Notice that (XY = XE = XD = ZE = ZD). So, (DY + EY = 2XY implies DY + EY = DZ + EZ).    - Assume the contrary that (Y neq Z). Then from (F, Z, Y) collinear, (F) lies on segment (AB), and (Y, Z) lie on the same side of (AB), we must have either (Z) lies strictly inside (triangle DYE) or (Y) lies strictly inside (triangle DZE).    - If (Z) lies strictly inside (triangle DYE), it's well known that (DY + EY > DZ + EZ). A contradiction.    - Similarly, if (Y) lies strictly inside (triangle DZE), we have (DZ + EZ > DY + EY). Again, another contradiction.    - Therefore, we must have (Y = Z). Claim 4 is now proven. 7. **Final Calculation**    - Notice that      [      angle DYE = angle DCE = angle DCA + angle ACB + angle BCE = frac{angle CAB}{2} + angle ACB + frac{angle CBA}{2} = 90^circ + frac{angle ACB}{2}      ]      and      [      angle DZE = angle DXE = 2(180^circ - angle DCE) = 180^circ - angle ACB      ]    - Because (Y = Z), then      [      90^circ + frac{angle ACB}{2} = 180^circ - angle ACB implies angle ACB = 60^circ      ] The final answer is (boxed{60^circ})."},{"instruction":"A teacher teaches 3 classes a day, one lesson per class.

Let's plug in our intercept points (a,0) and (0,a), as well as the given point (3, 6): frac{y - 0}{a - 0} = frac{x - a}{0 - a}. Since the line also passes through (3, 6), we substitute x with 3 and y with 6: frac{6 - 0}{a - 0} = frac{3 - a}{0 - a}, which simplifies to: frac{6}{a} = frac{3 - a}{-a}. Multiplying both sides by -a, we get: -6 = 3 - a. Adding a to both sides gives us: a - 6 = 3. Now solving for a, we have: a = 3 + 6. a = 9. Now that we have a = 9, which is the distance from the origin to the intercepts on both axes, we have the intercepts: (9, 0) and (0, 9). The equation of a line with intercepts on the axes is given by: frac{x}{a} + frac{y}{a} = 1. Substituting a = 9 into the equation gives us the line's equation: frac{x}{9} + frac{y}{9} = 1.

How do the surfaces of these bodies compare to each other?","output":"1. First, consider a sphere of radius r. A cone is inscribed in the sphere so that the cone base has radius R. For an equal-sided cone (textit{regular cone}), the height of the cone h and the slant height l are related such that h = l. This implies the radius of the base R is linked with the height and radius of the sphere. However, let's solve for R when inscribed within the sphere.    2. When a sphere of radius r is inscribed within a cone, the radius R of the cone's base can be calculated as follows. For a cone inscribed in the sphere:    [    R = frac{r}{2} sqrt{3}    ]    Here, the smaller cone has its base on the surface of the sphere. 3. To find the surface area of this smaller cone, the formula for the lateral surface area of the cone ( A = pi R l ) can be used, where ( l ) is the slant height of the cone. Since ( h = l ) in our scenario:    [    l = sqrt{R^2 + h^2} = sqrt{left(frac{r}{2} sqrt{3}right)^2 + r^2}    ]    Simplifying,    [    l = sqrt{frac{3r^2}{4} + r^2} = sqrt{frac{7r^2}{4}} = frac{sqrt{7}}{2} r     ]    The slant height ( l ) thus becomes ( r ) (The crux is to ensure the cone entirely fits within). However, this calculated value is important. The primary calculation we will use the standard area formula for the cone considering the simplified surface relation in step 2. 4. The surface area ( f_1 ) for the smaller cone can thus be expressed as:    [    f_1 = pi R l = pi left( frac{r}{2} sqrt{3} right) left( r right) = pi left(frac{r sqrt{3}}{2}right)^2 =  pi cdot frac{3r^2}{4} = frac{3pi r^2}{4}    ] 5. Next, calculate the surface area of the sphere ( f_2 ). The formula for the surface area of a sphere is given by:    [    f_2 = 4 pi r^2    ] 6. Now, consider a cone circumscribed around the sphere. The circumscribed cone will have the base radius of the sphere.    [    R = r sqrt{3}    ]    Following a similar calculation of the surface formula and the derived (step 4), its surface area ( f_3 ) would be:    [    f_3 = pi R l = pi left( r sqrt{3} right) left( r right) = pi cdot 3r^2 = 3 pi r^2    ] 7. To find the ratio of the surface areas of the smaller cone, sphere, and the larger cone:    [    f_1 : f_2 : f_3    ]    Plugging in the values calculated:    [    f_1 : f_2 : f_3 = frac{3}{4} pi r^2 : 4 pi r^2 : 3 pi r^2    ]    Factor out ( pi r^2 ):    [    f_1 : f_2 : f_3 = frac{3}{4} : 4 : 3    ]    Normalize these ratios:    [    f_1 : f_2 : f_3 = left( frac{9}{4} : 4 pi r^2 : 9  pi r^2 right)    ]    Simplify through a common factor (4):    [    f_1 : f_2 : f_3 = frac{9}{4} : 4 : 9 = 9 : 16 : 36     ] 8.

Since the minimum must occur at one of the endpoints, we consider both possibilities and determine which one leads to a that satisfies the condition: 1. If a = -2, then f(0) = -2 and f(1) = 3 - 2 = 1. 2. If 3 + a = -2, then a = -5, which would give f(0) = -5 and f(1) = 3 - 5 = -2. Between a = -2 and a = -5, the former allows f(1) to be 1, which is a higher value than -2 for the minimum. Therefore, the correct value for a is -2, and f(1) = 1 will be the maximum value of f(x) on [0,1].

Thus, a^2 > b^2 is not true. For option B: If c=0, then ac^{2} = 0 and bc^{2} = 0. Thus, ac^{2} > bc^{2} is not true. For option C: If a=1 and b=-2, then sqrt{a} = 1 and sqrt{b} is undefined for real numbers. Thus, sqrt{a} > sqrt{b} is not true. For option D: Given that a > b, we can subtract 1 from both sides to get a - 1 > b - 1. Then, subtracting 1 from the right side again, we get a - 1 > b - 2. Thus, a - 1 > b - 2 is true.

Consider the following:     - We have a regular octahedron that is divided into white and black faces such that any two adjacent faces are of different colors.     - The octahedral structure can be inscribed in a cube where the vertices of the octahedron are the midpoints of the edges of the cube.  2. Let's visualize the cube ABCDEFGH as shown in the figure.     - Two tetrahedrons, ACFH and BDEG, intersect each other. The intersection of these two tetrahedrons gives us the octahedron.     - Vertices of the intersection are the midpoints of the cube's faces. These midpoints of the faces are vertices of the octahedron. 3. Black faces of the octahedron lie on one tetrahedron, while white faces lie on the other tetrahedron. 4. To use the sum of distances property:     - Consider any inner point O in the octahedron.     - Let h_A, h_B, h_C, h_D be the distances from the point O to the faces BCD, ACD, ABD, ABC respectively.     - Let S stand for the area of a face of the tetrahedron ABCD.          From geometry, the volumes of the smaller tetrahedrons BCDO, ACDO, ABDO, and ABCO inside ABCD are given by:     [     frac{1}{3} S h_A, frac{1}{3} S h_B, frac{1}{3} S h_C, text{and} frac{1}{3} S h_D      ] 5. The volume V of the tetrahedron ABCD can be written as the sum of these volumes:     [     V = frac{1}{3} S left( h_A + h_B + h_C + h_D right)     ]    This implies that the sum of distances from any point inside the tetrahedron to its faces is:     [     h_A + h_B + h_C + h_D = frac{3V}{S}     ] 6. Hence, for the initial problem:     - Taking the sum of all distances to the black faces and comparing it to the sum of all distances to the white faces, which are equidistant, we can conclude the proof. # Method 2: Linear Functional Properties 1. Consider oriented distances:     - If the point and the octahedron lie on the same side of a plane, we consider the distance with a positive sign; otherwise, with a negative sign.    2. Stronger Assertion:     - The sum of oriented distances to the black faces is equal to the sum of oriented distances to the white faces, even if the point does not lie inside the octahedron. 3. Orientated distance is a linear functional in space (Fact 25). 4. Let X be any point in space. The sum of distances to the white faces is l_w(X) and to the black faces is l_b(X). We want to show l_b(X) - l_w(X) = 0.     - Suppose it is not so; the null set of l_b - l_w forms a plane.     - This plane essentially returns zero at all vertices of the octahedron—given the properties deduced, leading to a contradiction.      Thus, [ l_b - l_w equiv 0. ] # Conclusion: For any point inside the octahedron, the sum of distances to the white faces is equal to the sum of distances to the black faces.   blacksquare"},{"instruction":"Given that cos alpha = frac{4}{5} and alpha in (frac{pi}{2}, pi), find the value of tan(alpha + frac{pi}{4}).","output":"Since we know that cos alpha = -frac{4}{5} and alpha is in the second quadrant, we can infer that sin alpha = frac{3}{5} and tan alpha = frac{sin alpha}{cos alpha} = -frac{3}{4}.

Suppose every team member has to duty ( m ) times in total. 2. **Formulating the Equation:**         Since there are 33 members and we are ensuring each member does the same number of shifts, we set up the following equation:     [     9k + 10n = 33m     ]     Here, ( 9k ) represents the total number of shifts completed by 9 people over ( k ) days, and ( 10n ) represents the total number of shifts completed by 10 people over ( n ) days. The sum of all these shifts must equal the number of shifts each individual member takes multiplied by 33, the total number of members. 3. **Finding ( m ):**     To find the smallest ( m ) such that ( 9k + 10n = 33m ) has integer solutions for ( k ) and ( n ), we check integer values of ( m ):     - When ( m = 1 ):       [       9k + 10n = 33       ]       This equation does not have integer solutions for ( k ) and ( n ).          - When ( m = 2 ):       [       9k + 10n = 66       ]       We need to find non-negative integers ( k ) and ( n ) that satisfy this equation. 4. **Solving for ( k ) and ( n ):**     By inspection or by solving the Diophantine equation:     [     9k + 10n = 66     ]          Let's find ( k ) and ( n ):     [     k = 4 quad text{and} quad n = 3      ]     Verification:     [     9 times 4 + 10 times 3 = 36 + 30 = 66      ]     Therefore, ( k = 4 ) and ( n = 3 ). 5. **Checking Total Days:**     The total number of days ( T ) is given by:     [     T = k + n = 4 + 3 = 7     ] 6. **Conclusion:**     Each team member takes exactly 2 shifts over 7 days, ensuring the distribution is even.

Speed of first train in m/s = 80 km/h * (1000 m / 1 km) * (1 h / 3600 s) = 80 * 1000 / 3600 = 800/36 m/s Speed of second train in m/s = 100 km/h * (1000 m / 1 km) * (1 h / 3600 s) = 100 * 1000 / 3600 = 1000/36 m/s When the trains are running in the same direction, their relative speed is the difference of their speeds: Relative speed (same direction) = Speed of second train - Speed of first train = (1000/36) - (800/36) m/s = (200/36) m/s = (50/9) m/s The total length of the trains is the sum of their lengths: Total length = Length of first train + Length of second train = 120 m + 150 m = 270 m The time taken to cross each other while running in the same direction is given as 60 seconds. We can use the formula: Time = Distance / Speed 60 seconds = 270 m / (50/9) m/s 60 seconds = 270 m * (9/50) s/m 60 seconds = (270 * 9) / 50 seconds 60 seconds = 2430 / 50 seconds 60 seconds = 48.6 seconds However, we know the time is 60 seconds, so this is just a check to ensure our relative speed calculation is correct.

Approach 1: Using the Law of Sines 1. We start by using the Law of Sines in different triangles formed by the interior point ( O ) in the pentagon ( ABCDE ). 2. By applying the Law of Sines in each triangle, we obtain the following relationships:    [    frac{OA}{sin angle 10} = frac{OB}{sin angle 1} = frac{OB}{sin angle 2} = frac{OC}{sin angle 3} = frac{OC}{sin angle 4}    ]    [    = frac{OD}{sin angle 5} = frac{OD}{sin angle 6} = frac{OE}{sin angle 7} = frac{OE}{sin angle 8} = frac{OA}{sin angle 9}    ] 3.

This means the domain of f(x) is {xleft|right.xneq 0}. 2. **Condition for Even Function**: For f(x) to be even, fleft(-xright) must equal fleft(xright). 3. **Applying the Even Function Condition**:    - We calculate fleft(-xright):       fleft(-xright) = frac{-x{e^{-x}}}{{e^{-ax}-1}}    - Setting fleft(-xright) equal to fleft(xright) gives us:      frac{-x{e^{-x}}}{{e^{-ax}-1}} = frac{x{e^x}}{{e^{ax}-1}} 4. **Simplifying the Equation**:    - Multiplying both sides by -1 and rearranging terms, we get:      frac{x{e^{ax-x}}}{{e^{ax}-1}} = frac{x{e^x}}{{e^{ax}-1}}    - This simplification relies on the property that multiplying by -1 in the numerator and flipping the sign in the exponent are equivalent actions. 5. **Solving for a**:    - From the simplified equation, we observe that for the equality to hold for all x in the domain, the exponents of e must be equal.

This congruency implies that angles CBO and FBO are each 30^circ, making angle BOC = 60^circ. 2. **Calculate BC Using a 30-60-90 Triangle**: Knowing that in a 30-60-90 triangle, the ratio of the lengths of the longer leg to the shorter leg is sqrt{3}, we find that BC = CO cdot sqrt{3} = 6sqrt{3}text{ cm}. 3. **Identify Rectangle and Calculate CD**: Observing that angles DCO, CDE, and DEO are all 90^circ, we conclude that quadrilateral CDEO forms a rectangle.

The discriminant of this quadratic equation is: [Delta = 0^2 - 4 cdot 3 cdot a = -12a.] For the equation to have two distinct real roots, we require Delta > 0, which leads to: [-12a > 0 implies a < 0.] Next, we analyze the behavior of f(x) based on the sign of f'(x). When f'(x) > 0, the function is monotonically increasing, and when f'(x) < 0, the function is monotonically decreasing.

We can write the sum of an arithmetic sequence as S_n = frac{n}{2} (a_1 + a_n). For the 11-term sum, this becomes S_{11} = frac{11}{2}(a_1 + a_{11}). Similarly, the 12-term sum is S_{12} = frac{12}{2}(a_1 + a_{12}). As per the given information, we have: S_{11} = frac{11}{2}(a_1 + a_{11}) > 0, which suggests the average of the first and eleventh term is positive, so a_1 + a_{11} > 0. Dividing through by 11, we can substitute by the mean term, obtaining a_6 > 0, since a_6 is the average of a_1 and a_{11} in a arithmetic sequence. On the other hand, S_{12} = frac{12}{2}(a_1 + a_{12}) < 0, there by averaging a_1 and a_{12}, we obtain a_1 + a_{12} < 0. Again, dividing through by 12, the average of a_1 and a_{12} gives us a_7 < 0, since a_7 is the average of a_1 and a_{12} in an arithmetic sequence. Considering that for an arithmetic sequence to transition from positive sums to negative sums, it must be decreasing, and hence the sequence must be monotonic decreasing. The maximum value of n for S_n to be the largest will then be at the last term which is still positive, which is term 6, since a_6 > 0 and a_7< 0 implies that S_n begins to decrease after the 6th term.

Prove that this heptagon has four equal angles.","output":"1. **Understanding the Problem**: We need to show that in a convex 7-gon, there exist four angles that are equal. Additionally, it is given that if we choose any four angles, compute their sines, and any three remaining angles, compute their cosines, the sum of these values remains constant regardless of the choice. 2. **Setting Up the Sum**: Consider one possible sum as described. Let’s choose four angles of the 7-gon and compute their sines, and calculate the cosines of the other three angles. 3. **Rearranging the Arguments**: Let's look at swapping the arguments of one sine and one cosine. We denote these arguments by alpha and beta respectively. The change in sum due to swapping sin alpha and cos beta with sin beta and cos alpha is given by: [ (sin beta + cos alpha) - (sin alpha + cos beta) ] 4. **Using Angle Addition Formulas**: We use the angle addition and subtraction formulas to rewrite the expression: [ (sin beta + cos alpha) - (sin alpha + cos beta) = sqrt{2} (sin(beta - pi/4) - sin(alpha - pi/4)) ] 5. **Considering Sums Independence**: Since the sum is independent of the initial choice of angles, it follows that: [ sin (alpha - pi/4) = sin (beta - pi/4) ] 6. **Solving Trigonometric Equality**: Due to the periodic nature of sine function, within the interval ( (0, pi) ), this equality can happen either if: [ alpha - pi/4 = beta - pi/4 quad text{or} quad alpha - pi/4 = pi - (beta - pi/4) ] Which simplifies to: [ beta = alpha quad text{or} quad beta = 2pi - alpha ] However, since (alpha) and (beta) are angles of the 7-gon, the second case typically simplifies further based on the restrictions of the polygon’s angle sum and periodicity of trigonometric functions. 7. **Limiting the Number of Distinct Angles**: Since the 7-gon's sine of each angle with (pi/4) subtracted must produce the same value (a requirement for the sum to be invariant), the above results imply that there can be at most two distinct types of angles in the 7-gon. 8. **Confirming Equal Angles**: Given that there are 7 angles and at most two distinct values, by the pigeonhole principle, at least four of those seven angles must have the same value. # Conclusion Thus, in any convex 7-gon, there will be at least four angles that are equal.

First, let's factorize 256. Since 256 is a power of 2, we have: 256 = 2^8 For the product n(n + 1)(n + 2) to be divisible by 2^8, the three consecutive integers must contain at least eight factors of 2. However, since they are consecutive, at most one of them can be even. Therefore, we need to find a set of three consecutive integers where at least one of them has 2^8 as a factor. Let's consider the possibilities: - If n is even, then n + 1 is odd and cannot contribute any factors of 2. Therefore, n must have at least 2^8 as a factor. The next even number that could have 2^8 as a factor would be n + 2(2^8) because n + 2 would be even but not have enough factors of 2. - If n is odd, then n + 1 is even. For n + 1 to have 2^8 as a factor, it must be a multiple of 256. The next possible value for n + 1 to be a multiple of 256 would be n + 1 + 256. Now, we need to find all the even numbers that are multiples of 256 within the range of 1 to 1000. The smallest even multiple of 256 is 256 itself, and the largest is 768 (since 1024 is outside our range). So, the numbers that satisfy the condition are 256, 512, and 768. For each of these, there are two possible values of n that will make n(n + 1)(n + 2) divisible by 256: - For 256, n can be 254 or 255. - For 512, n can be 510 or 511. - For 768, n can be 766 or 767. Therefore, there are 6 values of n that satisfy the condition out of 1000 possible values.

This means that the function values are symmetric around x=2. - Similarly, if we let c = 7+x and d = 7-x, then c + d = 14, and according to the second property, f(c) = f(d).

Therefore, the polygon formed by these points is also convex. 3. **Bounding the Area:**    To estimate the area of this polygon, note that it lies between the curve (y = x^2) and the x-axis from (x = 1) to (x = n). The area under the curve (y = x^2) from (x = 1) to (x = n) is given by the integral:    [    int_1^n x^2 , dx = left[ frac{x^3}{3} right]_1^n = frac{n^3}{3} - frac{1}{3}    ]    Since the area of the polygon is less than the area under the curve plus some small additional area due to the discrete nature of the points, we can bound the area of the polygon by:    [    text{Area}(P) < n cdot n^2 = n^3    ]    Therefore, we can choose (a = 1) such that the area of (P) is less than (an^3).

Step 3. Analyze specific room pairs If two beacons are placed, consider cases of ambiguity: - The robot in room E5 may hear the same signals as in room A4.  - This occurs because both rooms share a similar corridor layout concerning beacon placement in K or N.

Finally, angle EOD = angle EOB + angle BOD = 2y + angle EOB = 3y. With angle EOD = 60^circ, we get 3y = 60^circ.

According to the problem, when the point (1,2) is outside the circle, there are always two tangents from the point (1,2) to the circle x^{2}+y^{2}+2x-4y+k-2=0.

To solve this problem, we first transform the given circle equation into the standard form to find the center coordinates and the radius r. Then, we use the distance formula to find the distance d between the point (1,2) and the center of the circle. Since the point (1,2) can be the intersection of two tangents of the circle, the point must be outside the circle. This means that the distance d is greater than the radius r. By setting up an inequality with d and r, and considering that 7-k > 0, we can find the range of k.

Since P and Q lie on the circle and form a right angle at the origin, OP and OQ are radii of the circle.

For x > 0, f(x) = x^3 + 1. 2. For x < 0, f(x) = ax^3 + b. Since f(x) is even, f(x) = f(-x) for all x. Let's consider x < 0 (which implies -x > 0): - f(-x) = (-x)^3 + 1 = -x^3 + 1 because -x > 0. - f(x) = ax^3 + b because x < 0. Setting f(-x) = f(x), we get: [-x^3 + 1 = ax^3 + b.] Comparing coefficients on both sides of the equation, we find: - For the x^3 term: -1 = a. - For the constant term: 1 = b. Therefore, a = -1 and b = 1.

Prove that as a result, a sequence is obtained in which all terms are equal to the same number.

After doing this ( k ) times, we obtain a sequence in which all terms are equal to the same number. Prove that this number is ( k! ). 1. **Base Case:**     - For ( k = 1 ), the sequence is ( u_n = n ).     - The sequence of the first differences is:       [       Delta u_n = u_{n+1} - u_n = (n+1) - n = 1.       ]     - Clearly, all terms in this sequence are equal to ( boxed{1} = 1! ). 2. **Inductive Hypothesis:**     - Assume that for some ( k = k_0 ), after taking differences ( k_0 ) times, we obtain a sequence in which all terms are equal to ( k_0! ). 3. **Inductive Step:**     - We need to prove that the same holds for ( k = k_0 + 1 ).     - Consider the sequence ( u_n = n^{k_0 + 1} ).     - The first sequence of differences ( Delta u_n ) is given by:       [       Delta u_n = u_{n+1} - u_n = (n+1)^{k_0 + 1} - n^{k_0 + 1}.       ]     - By the Binomial Theorem, we have:       [       (n+1)^{k_0 + 1} = sum_{i=0}^{k_0+1} binom{k_0+1}{i} n^i.       ]     - Therefore:       [       Delta u_n = sum_{i=0}^{k_0+1} binom{k_0+1}{i} n^i - n^{k_0 + 1} = sum_{i=0}^{k_0} binom{k_0+1}{i} n^i.       ] 4. **Polynomial Form:**     - The resulting sequence of differences ( Delta u_n ) is a polynomial of degree ( k_0 ) with leading coefficient ( binom{k_0+1}{k_0} = k_0+1 ). 5. **Further Differences:**     - By the inductive hypothesis, after taking differences ( k_0 ) more times, all terms reach the value:       [       (k_0+1) k_0! = (k_0+1)!.       ] 6. **Conclusion:**     - Hence, by induction, after ( k ) differences, the sequence ( u_n = n^k ) reduces to a sequence where all terms are equal to ( k! ). Therefore, when taking the ( k )-th sequence of differences of ( u_n = n^k ), all terms are equal to ( boxed{k!} )."}]`),D={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:P,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},F={class:"search-container"},N={class:"card-container"},z={key:0,class:"empty-state"},E=["disabled"],I={key:0},W={key:1};function L(n,e,h,u,o,r){const m=p("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",F,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=s=>o.searchQuery=s),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[x,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=s=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):c("",!0)]),t("div",N,[(a(!0),i(w,null,y(r.displayedPoems,(s,g)=>(a(),v(m,{key:g,poem:s},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),r.displayedPoems.length===0?(a(),i("div",z,' No results found for "'+l(o.searchQuery)+'".
