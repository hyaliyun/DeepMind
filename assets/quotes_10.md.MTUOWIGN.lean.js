For Englishmen in their fifties (and I am in that bracket), it is always entertaining to see glimpses of and hear sounds of the Swinging Sixties, and although this film spends a lot of time in offices, it has plenty of Sixties nostalgia, including red buses, Carnaby Street, a song by Lulu and a delicious shot up the micro-skirt of a waitress, the like of which England has never seen since in public places.

Movie title: Family Plot Context: A fake psychic, Blanche Tyler (Barbara Harris), and her boyfriend, George Lumley (Bruce Dern), attempt to locate the nephew of a wealthy and guilt-ridden elderly woman, Julia Rainbird (Cathleen Nesbitt). Julia's deceased sister gave the baby boy up for adoption, but Julia now wants to make him her heir, and will pay Blanche 10,000 if the man, Edward Shoebridge, can be found. George Lumley discovers that Shoebridge is thought to be dead, but he tracks down another criminal, Joseph Maloney (Ed Lauter), who paid for the tombstone over an empty grave. Shoebridge murdered his adoptive parents, faked his own death and is now a successful jeweler in San Francisco known as Arthur Adamson (William Devane). He and his live-in girlfriend, Fran (Karen Black), kidnap millionaires and dignitaries, returning them in exchange for ransoms in the form of valuable gemstones. Arthur conceals an enormous diamond in plain sight in their crystal chandelier. Arthur enlists Maloney, who had helped murder his adoptive parents, to kill Blanche and George. Maloney initially refuses to help, but then contacts Blanche and George, telling them to meet him at a cafÃ© atop a mountain. He cuts the brake line of Blanche's car, but the couple manage to survive a dangerous high-speed descent. Maloney then tries to run them over, but dies in a fiery explosion when he swerves to avoid an oncoming car and tumbles down the mountain. At Maloney's funeral, his mother (Katherine Helmond) tearfully confesses to George that Shoebridge's name is now Arthur Adamson. George has to go to work, so Blanche tracks down various A. Adamsons in San Francisco, eventually reaching the jewelry store as it closes for the day. Arthur's assistant Mrs. Clay (Edith Atwater) offers to let Blanche leave a note, but Blanche says she is Arthur's friend and asks for his address.

MOSCOW (Reuters) - Moscow will respond to a new set of U.S. sanctions by expanding its “black list” of Americans, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said on Friday, according to RIA news agency.      The U.S. Treasury slapped sanctions on 19 Russian citizens and five entities on Thursday in the most significant steps the United States has taken against Russia since U.S. President Donald Trump took office.      “From the very beginning, we use the principle of parity on the number of people included in sanction lists. So we will expand our ‘black list’ with another group of Americans,” Ryabkov was cited as saying.      He added that Moscow did not rule out extra measures in response to new sanctions for alleged interfering in U.S. elections and cyber attacks, which Russia denies.      Moscow still wants to maintain a dialogue with Washington and takes counter-measures due to “American political stubbornness”, RIA cited the diplomat as saying.      “Those (American) politicians are playing with fire by destroying Russian-American relationship because simultaneously they shake global stability,” Ryabkov said, according to RIA.

Running is a method of terrestrial locomotion allowing humans and other animals to move rapidly on foot. Running is a type of gait characterized by an aerial phase in which all feet are above the ground (though there are exceptions). This is in contrast to walking, where one foot is always in contact with the ground, the legs are kept mostly straight and the center of gravity vaults over the stance leg or legs in an inverted pendulum fashion. A characteristic feature of a running body from the viewpoint of spring-mass mechanics is that changes in kinetic and potential energy within a stride occur simultaneously, with energy storage accomplished by springy tendons and passive muscle elasticity. The term running can refer to any of a variety of speeds ranging from jogging to sprinting. Multi-choice problem: Is it true that do both feet leave the ground when running? OPT:  A). no  B). yes The answer is:","output":"B). yes When running, both feet leave the ground at the same time, which makes it different from walking. When you walk, one foot is always touching the ground. But in running, there is a moment, called the aerial phase, when no feet are touching the ground, and you're sort of like flying for a little bit. This makes you go faster than just walking.

As The Five's campaign against Rubinstein continued in the press, Tchaikovsky found himself almost as much a target as his former teacher. Cui reviewed the performance of Tchaikovsky's graduation cantata and lambasted the composer as \\"utterly feeble.... If he had any talent at all ... it would surely at some point in the piece have broken free of the chains imposed by the Conservatory.\\" The review's effect on the sensitive composer was devastating. Eventually, an uneasy truce developed as Tchaikovsky became friendly with Balakirev and eventually with the other four composers of the group. A working relationship between Balakirev and Tchaikovsky resulted in Romeo and Juliet. The Five's approval of this work was further followed by their enthusiasm for Tchaikovsky's Second Symphony. Subtitled the Little Russian (Little Russia was the term at that time for what is now called the Ukraine) for its use of Ukrainian folk songs, the symphony in its initial version also used several compositional devices similar to those used by the Five in their work. Stasov suggested the subject of Shakespeare's The Tempest to Tchaikovsky, who wrote a tone poem based on this subject. After a lapse of several years, Balakirev reentered Tchaikovsky's creative life; the result was Tchaikovsky's Manfred Symphony, composed to a program after Lord Byron originally written by Stasov and supplied by Balakirev. Overall, however, Tchaikovsky continued down an independent creative path, traveling a middle course between those of his nationalistic peers and the traditionalists.

To ensure that vacationers have an exceptional experience and to meet the diverse needs of different tourists, private investors have decided to collaborate with the local authorities of Samokov to develop and construct new ski slopes and a lift. This partnership aims to create new opportunities for both tourists and businesses within the area, benefiting all stakeholders involved. The private investors and local authorities will likely conduct a thorough analysis of the current tourism infrastructure in Samokov to identify areas that require improvement, focusing on the ski slopes and access to them. This may involve examining existing ski resorts, accommodation options, activity offerings, and transportation services. By identifying the strengths and weaknesses of the existing infrastructure, a comprehensive development plan can be created, which will include the construction of new ski slopes and a well-integrated lift system. One potential approach to constructing the new ski slopes is to engage with professional ski resort developers who have extensive knowledge of designing and building ski facilities that appeal to tourists' diverse preferences. This may include creating slopes suitable for beginners, intermediate, and advanced skiers and snowboarders. Ensuring that the slopes cater to a wide range of skill levels will maximize the potential for a successful resort, attracting more tourists to the area. In addition to designing and constructing the slopes, the investors and local authorities may also need to consider the environmental impact of such a development. This would involve conducting environmental assessments to ensure that any new infrastructure is sustainable and does not negatively impact the surrounding natural environment. This is particularly relevant considering the increasing focus on eco-tourism and the need for sustainable tourism practices across the industry. The lift system, which is an integral part of any successful ski resort, will require careful planning and development as well. The investors and local authorities must consider factors such as the layout of the ski slopes, potential visitor capacity, and the overall efficiency of the system when designing and constructing the lift. Additionally, accessibility for disabled individuals and family-friendly design should not be overlooked when developing this key infrastructure.

Here are possible answers to this question: - working ground - quarry - desert - work area - under ground  I believe the correct choice is \\"work area\\", here's why: Answer:","output":"Work area An excavation site is a location where archaeologists, geologists, or construction workers dig into the ground to uncover artifacts, fossils, minerals, or to prepare the area for construction. Let us examine each of the given options and justify why \\"work area\\" is the appropriate choice: 1. Working ground: This is a term used to describe an area where work is being done. While an excavation site is a type of working ground, this term is not specific enough to describe the particular characteristics of an excavation site. 2. Quarry: A quarry is a place where stone, sand, or minerals are extracted from the ground. While excavation can occur in a quarry, not all excavation sites are quarries. Quarries focus on extracting specific materials, while excavation sites may have varied objectives. 3. Desert: A desert is a large, dry area with little or no precipitation and limited vegetation. Excavation sites can be found in deserts, but the term \\"desert\\" does not describe the nature of an excavation site. 4. Work area: This term best describes an excavation site as it highlights the purpose of the location – to conduct work. The work conducted at excavation sites, like digging into the ground and analyzing uncovered materials, is unique and distinct from other types of work areas. 5. Underground: An underground location is a subsurface area, such as a cave or a mine. While excavation sometimes involves digging underground, not all excavation sites are located underground. Thus, the correct choice is \\"work area\\" as it accurately describes the purpose and activities conducted at an excavation site, without being too vague or specific to other, unrelated types of locations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A few years ago, Vegas was one of my “bucket list” places – one of those iconic cities that one should visit at least once in their life. For me, once was enough. This is now my 4th (I think?) trip to Vegas, and while the city has a lot to offer, it’s just not my cup of tea. For one thing, I’m not a gambler, like at all. I don’t have anything against it, I just don’t enjoy it. It either feels pointless or stressful to me. The city itself makes me a little sad – in some cases, it reeks of desperation. Last time I was there, my cab driver entertained me with stories of how she was working 3 jobs to save up enough to join some mega-massive bingo game. She won a small jackpot a few years back and that allowed her to work only one job for a few months. She was hoping to win again so she could cut back to 1 or 2 jobs. I wondered how many people do similar things – gambling their money away, in big or small chunks, in the hopes of that big score and in the process, putting themselves in a not-great financial situation. I suppose as long it makes them happy, then it’s all OK, but I can’t help but think someone like my cab driver might be happier overall if she only worked 1 job instead of 3, instead of working extra jobs to save up money to gamble her way to financial freedom. But that’s for her to decide, not me.  The juxtaposition of extreme and in-your-face wealth and the homeless people on the Strip also makes me sad. It’s difficult to see people begging for food and sleeping on the street while all around you, millions of dollars are poured into creating a massive playground with every type of indulgence possible. But I’m the first to say that I’ve enjoyed staying in some of the nicer hotel properties there and eating several excellent meals at some of the finer restaurants in the area, so I’m not exactly helping to solve the problem.

His call comes after Justice Ginsburg, 83, moved beyond her usual candour to disparage Mr Trump in a series of interviews. Critics say the liberal judge has risked her legacy to lambast Mr Trump. \\"He is a faker,\\" Justice Ginsburg told CNN on Monday. \\"He has no consistency about him. He says whatever comes into his head at the moment. He really has an ego.\\" In a recent New York Times interview, Justice Ginsburg also said a Trump presidency would be unimaginable. \\"I can't imagine what this place would be - I can't imagine what the country would be - with Donald Trump as our president,\\" she said. \\"For the country, it could be four years. For the court, it could be - I don't even want to contemplate that.\\" Justice Ginsburg also quipped that she would move to New Zealand if he should win the White House. On Tuesday, Mr Trump fired back, telling the New York Times it was \\"highly inappropriate that a United States Supreme Court judge gets involved in a political campaign, frankly\\". The likely Republican nominee said her remarks were a \\"disgrace to the court\\" and insisted she should apologise. Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan also weighed in, saying the Justice's remarks revealed \\"bias\\" during a CNN town hall interview on Wednesday. \\"For someone on the Supreme Court who is going to be calling balls and strikes in the future based upon what the next president and Congress does, that strikes me as inherently biased and out of the realm\\", he said. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest brushed off the idea that the comments were inappropriate and said \\"she didn't earn the nickname 'The Notorious RBG' for nothing\\". Justice Ginsburg also recently told the Associated Press that \\"it's likely that the next president, whoever she will be, will have a few appointments to make\\". She is the oldest justice on the court and will be one of three judges over the age of 78 on Election Day.

The factory is highly automated and designed to shift flexibly to produce many different kinds of chips to suit demand. \\"The diversity is the big difference with this plant,\\" said Richard Doherty, president of Envisioneering, a research firm. \\"It gives IBM the capability to make so many different kinds of custom chips, and the world is going to custom chips.\\" The 140,000-square-foot plant is a testament to advanced manufacturing technology. The 300-millimeter silicon wafers -- about the size of a standard pizza -- are shuttled around the facility in enclosed plastic pods, which ride on overhead tracks. They drop down from wires automatically into machines, sheathed in stainless steel and glass, for each stage of processing and fabrication. Throughout the 500 processing steps, which typically last 20 days, the wafers are not touched by human hands. The circuits etched into the chips are less than one thousandth the width of a human hair. Human operators are there to monitor the systems, catch errors and fine-tune the production process for maximum efficiency. Because each of the hundreds of processing machines is self-enclosed, and essentially airtight, the uniforms operators wear are less constricting than in the previous generation of chip plants, which looked like space suits. The operators at the East Fishkill factory wear light nylon uniforms, light blue shoe coverings and translucent hair nets made of paper. They look more like workers in a bakery.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Background: Seafloor spreading helps explain continental drift in the theory of plate tectonics. When oceanic plates diverge, tensional stress causes fractures to occur in the lithosphere. The motivating force for seafloor spreading ridges is tectonic plate pull rather than magma pressure, although there is typically significant magma activity at spreading ridges. At a spreading center, basaltic magma rises up the fractures and cools on the ocean floor to form new seabed. Hydrothermal vents are common at spreading centers. Older rocks will be found farther away from the spreading zone while younger rocks will be found nearer to the spreading zone. Additionally spreading rates determine if the ridge is fast, intermediate, or slow. As a general rule, fast ridges have spreading (opening) rates of more than 9 cm/year. Intermediate ridges have a spreading rate of 5–9 cm/year while slow spreading ridges have a rate less than 5 cm/year.  Paragraph: Two geology students had an exam on plate tectonics. Bobby learned more about divergent tectonic plates, while Nate was more confident in explaining everything about Convergent plates.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which student knew more about seafloor spreading? Answer:","output":"Bobby knew more about seafloor spreading, as he learned more about divergent tectonic plates.

Summarize this article: While the elements of the routine stay the same (eat, play, sleep, in that order), the length of the elements and the strategies you might use will vary as your child becomes more aware, interactive, and alert during the day and more conscious of your absence at night.  At 6 months old, most babies should not need a nighttime feeding, especially if he/she is eating solid food during the day.  When your baby begins to sleep through the night, you can stretch the period of activity to 2 to 2.5 hours of playtime between naps. There will also be times when you may need to be flexible with the schedule, such as vacations or when you need to run errands that take longer than 2 hours. During nap or bedtime, babies of this age often \\"talk\\" to themselves or babble, or cry out of tiredness to help themselves fall asleep. It's important that you don't rush to her before she has had a chance to settle in for sleep. Listen to the sound of the cry.  The most common signal that she wants to be comforted is your child holding out her hands to you. When you pick her up, hold her in a horizontal position and say soothing words before placing her back in the crib. If she gets more upset, walk away from her crib and avoid eye contact. You may be a distraction. At this age, your baby has become more aware of your absence and may benefit from an item that can help comfort and sooth her to sleep, such as a small, soft blanket or favorite sleep-safe toy. If possible, try to use the same object at every nap and bedtime, and try to keep the toy or blanket in the bed only. This way, the baby will learn to associate the transitional item with sleep and not with playtime, and will be more likely to use it to sooth herself to sleep rather than playing in the bed. Summary:","output":"As your baby grows, the routine elements of eating, playing, and sleeping remain the same, but their duration and strategies may change. By six months, babies usually don't need nighttime feeding and can have 2-2.5 hours of playtime between naps. Be flexible with the schedule during vacations or long errands. Babies may babble or cry during bedtime, but listen for signals they need comforting before intervening. If needed, provide a consistent sleep-safe object to comfort and soothe them during sleep, helping with the separation process."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

As he explores the mystical world, Danny unlocks transformational powers that aid him in overcoming various obstacles in both the real and magical worlds, leading him to solve a mystery that threatens to upend both worlds. Act One: The movie begins by introducing Danny Winters as he joins a new school after his family moves to the quaint town of Greenfield. While Danny struggles to make friends and settle in his new environment, he finds solace in the digital diary on his phone, where he frequently documents his thoughts and wishes. One day, while wandering in the woods behind his house, Danny unknowingly stumbles upon an ancient magical portal that transports him to the hidden world of Wayward – a place that exists parallel to the human world. There, Danny befriends an array of colorful and otherworldly characters like Zephyr, a shape-shifting faerie; Leo, a courageous talking fox; and Luna, the ethereal guardian of the portal. Act Two: As Danny becomes more engrossed in Wayward's enchanting atmosphere, he learns that the magical world is protected by the mysterious Council of Wayward, an ancient group made up of elders from each magical species. Danny's curiosity leads him to Luna, the guardian of the portal, who reveals that a dangerous villain, Mortimer Blackwood, plans to exploit Wayward's supernatural powers to create chaos and destruction in the human world. Luna informs Danny that his unique connection to both worlds and his pure heart qualify him to become the prophesized hero, destined to protect and restore the balance between the two realms. As Danny embarks on a journey to develop his newfound powers and fulfill his destiny, a growing bond and camaraderie develop among his newfound friends. With their help, Danny learns to manipulate the elements and harness the transformative power of his emotions to overcome obstacles and confront Blackwood's minions. Act Three: As Danny's powers continue to develop, so does his connection to the magical creatures and the people of Greenfield. Unbeknownst to Danny, his powers also make him visible to Mortimer Blackwood, who orchestrates a series of calamities in the human world, shifting the blame onto Danny and his magical companions. This causes a rift between the inhabitants of Greenfield and Wayward, weakening the connection between the two worlds. As Danny and his friends race against time to gather the final artifacts required to stop Blackwood's plan, they discover that Danny's digital diary has recorded their adventures and Blackwood's schemes. Using the diary's evidence, Danny manages to unite the people of both worlds against the nefarious villain. In an epic climax, Danny confronts Mortimer Blackwood in a thrilling showdown. Danny combines the power of the artifacts with his own transformative abilities, ultimately defeating the villain and restoring harmony to both worlds. As the movie ends, Danny, Zephyr, Leo, and Luna are hailed as heroes in both the human and magical realms. Danny's new friends gift him with a magical amulet, allowing him to visit Wayward whenever he wants. With newfound confidence, friendships, and a sense of purpose, Danny returns to Greenfield, proving that even a shy nine-year-old can achieve extraordinary things."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Would electronic ear protectors be appropriate for Carson, yes or no?  Hint: Electronic ear protectors work differently. They identify high-amplitude sound waves and send sound waves through them in the opposite direction. This causes destructive interference with the waves, which reduces their amplitude to zero or nearly zero. This changes even the loudest sounds to just a soft hiss. Sounds that people need to hear, such as the voices of co-workers, are not interfered with in this way and may be amplified instead so they can be heard more clearly.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Summarize the following: Steer clear of hot peppers, ginger, garlic, chili, paprika and other spices that raise your body's temperature. Eat bland foods for the weeks leading up to your period. Some women claim that this can help postpone your period because your body temperature isn't being elevated by the food, but there is no medical research to back this up. A traditional home remedy, it's not clear why it might work — but many women say that it does. You should eat it on an empty stomach, at least once a day for a week prior to when your cycle would normally begin. Boil a bunch of parsley in 16 oz of water for 20 minutes. Strain the liquid and add honey. Consume it two to three times per day, 15 days before your period is set to begin. Add a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar to an 8-oz glass of water. Start drinking three times a day at least three days before your period is set to begin. Again, remember that none of these remedies are backed up with scientific evidence. When you are habitually exercising, your levels of progesterone, a hormone known to inhibit menstrual bleeding, are elevated. Do strenuous activities like running, swimming, weight-lifting, or aerobics. If you are already engaged in some form of exercise, increase the intensity. If you are physically inactive, try a progressive exercise program to safely ease yourself into an exercise routine. This is not a suggestion to seek out more stress in your life — it is an observation that often one traumatic event will postpone or even prevent a normal menstrual cycle. Mental and emotional stress tend to put our bodies on alert, and your body will deal with the stress rather than creating your normal menstrual period.

Now let me also say, I'm a bit boogie when it comes to my hotel preferences so I'm not all about cost. I have realistic standards and understand the concept of \\"you get what you pay for\\" but I have NEVER gone wrong with LVH.   I'm not a big gambler so I love being here where the tables are hot but not incredibly expensive to join. There are a lot of options on the machines which is great for me because I love the penny machines, lol.   Its right off the strip and not on a street that is too hectic or in the hub of all the traffic, I don't care for any of that. I had bad customer service at the check in counter once but I attribute that to the lady who had a bad attitude and not the overall service at the hotel. When I requested toothpaste they had it to me very quickly which lets be honest, is kind of a big deal because no one goes out of their room with a hot mouth (let's hope not!)

What are some good hardware oriented projects to do in the final year of engineering for IT students? Multi-choice problem: Are these two questions inquiring about the same information? Choices: (i). no; (ii). yes;","output":"(i). No. The first question addresses the best type of United States Clinical Experience (USCE) for an international undergraduate medical student in the USA who is not in their final year, while the second question deals with suitable hardware-oriented projects for final year Information Technology (IT) engineering students. These questions are inquiring about the different information as they pertain to separate fields of study and distinct situations. I will now address each question individually. 1. Best type of USCE for international undergraduate medical students (not in their final year): United States Clinical Experience (USCE) usually entails gaining hands-on clinical experience in the US healthcare system. For international undergraduate (not in their final year) medical students, obtaining USCE is crucial for becoming a competitive candidate when applying for residency programs in the USA. The ideal USCE for an undergraduate medical student who has not yet entered their final year would include: a. Elective clerkships: Participate in elective rotations at US medical schools or affiliated hospitals, which provides an opportunity to get hands-on experience in your chosen specialty. These clerkships may also offer letter of recommendations (LORs) that can be beneficial when applying to residency programs. b. Research experience: If possible, engage in research projects related to your area of interest in a US medical school, hospital, or research institution. This experience can enhance your CV and provide valuable networking opportunities. c. Observerships or externships: These hands-on experiences allow medical students to shadow physicians in hospitals or clinics to understand patient care and gain insight into the US medical culture. While these do not often allow direct patient contact, they still provide students with the opportunity to familiarize themselves with different specialties and healthcare environments. 2. Good hardware-oriented final year projects for IT engineering students: For Information Technology students with an interest in hardware, here are some project ideas to consider for your final year: a. Raspberry Pi or Arduino-based projects: Utilize devices like Raspberry Pi or Arduino to create innovative systems like home automation, surveillance, or smart gardening solutions. b. IoT (Internet of Things) projects: Develop IoT-based systems that can collect, transmit, and process data from various devices and sensors. Typical applications include smart cities, wearable health monitoring devices, or intelligent transportation systems. c. Robotics and automation projects: Explore the world of robotics by developing robots capable of performing various tasks or interacting with their environment. Examples include drones, robotic arms, or autonomous vehicles. d. Embedded systems development: Design and develop an embedded system for a specific application, such as energy management, healthcare monitoring, or navigation. e. Hardware design and simulation: Use tools like VHDL or Verilog to design custom digital circuits or processors. Simulate and test your designs with hardware description languages and FPGA boards. Whichever project you choose, make sure to focus on creating innovative solutions while also demonstrating your understanding of hardware concepts and engineering principles."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the name of the person given the appointment of Professor at the Conservatoire?  It is not clear why, in 1873, Alkan decided to emerge from his self-imposed obscurity to give a series of six Petits Concerts at the Érard piano showrooms. It may have been associated with the developing career of Delaborde, who, returning to Paris in 1867, soon became a concert fixture, including in his recitals many works by his father, and who was at the end of 1872 given the appointment that had escaped Alkan himself, Professor at the Conservatoire. The success of the Petits Concerts led to them becoming an annual event (with occasional interruptions caused by Alkan's health) until 1880 or possibly beyond. The Petits Concerts featured music not only by Alkan but of his favourite composers from Bach onwards, played on both the piano and the pédalier, and occasionally with the participation of another instrumentalist or singer. He was assisted in these concerts by his siblings, and by other musicians including Delaborde, Camille Saint-Saëns, and Auguste Franchomme.Those encountering Alkan at this phase included the young Vincent d'Indy, who recalled Alkan's \\"skinny, hooked fingers\\" playing Bach on an Érard pedal piano: \\"I listened, riveted to the spot by the expressive, crystal-clear playing.\\" Alkan later played Beethoven's Op. 110 sonata, of which d'Indy said: \\"What happened to the great Beethovenian poem ...

Movie title: Mortal Kombat Context: The film is centered on Mortal Kombat, a fighting tournament between the representatives of the realms of Earth and Outworld conceived by the Elder Gods amid looming invasion of the Earth by Outworld. If the realm of Outworld wins Mortal Kombat ten consecutive times, its Emperor Shao Kahn will be able to invade and conquer the Earth realm. Shaolin monk Liu Kang and his comrades, movie star Johnny Cage and military officer Sonya Blade were handpicked by Raiden, the god of thunder and defender of the Earth realm, to overcome their powerful adversaries in order to prevent Outworld from winning their tenth straight Mortal Kombat tournament. Each of the three has his or her own reason for competing: Liu seeks revenge against the tournament host Shang Tsung for killing his brother Chan; Sonya seeks revenge on an Australian crime lord Kano; and Cage, having been branded as a fake by the media, seeks to prove otherwise. At Shang Tsung's island, Liu is attracted to Princess Kitana, Shao Kahn's adopted daughter. Aware that Kitana is a dangerous adversary because she is the rightful heir to Outworld and that she will attempt to ally herself with the Earth warriors, Tsung orders the creature Reptile to spy on her. Liu defeats his first opponent and Sonya gets her revenge on Kano by snapping his neck. Cage encounters and barely beats Scorpion. Liu engages in a brief duel with Kitana, who secretly offers him cryptic advice for his next battle. Liu's next opponent is Sub-Zero, whose defense seems untouched because of his freezing abilities, until Liu recalls Kitana's advice and uses it to kill Sub-Zero. Prince Goro enters the tournament and mercilessly crushes every opponent he faces. One of Cage's peers, Art Lean, is defeated by Goro as well and has his soul taken by Shang Tsung.

Aspen? You all have mostly Aspen or...?\\" In this case, the speaker is asking about the composition of a group, their possession or characteristics related to Aspen trees. The question seems to be asking if: (1) the entire group has Aspen, (2) the group has mostly Aspen, or (3) there are other alternatives. Now let's examine the hypothesis: \\"Some of you have aspen and some of you have something else.\\" This statement suggests that the group being referred to has a mix of individuals with Aspen and individuals without Aspen (who possess or are characterized by something else).  Considering the interpretations of the premise and the hypothesis, we can tentatively agree that the hypothesis could be true. If the speaker is inquiring about the composition of the group and allows for additional alternatives other than \\"mostly aspen,\\" then it is possible that the group could indeed be composed of some individuals with Aspen and others without Aspen.  However, it is important to note that the premise carries a degree of ambiguity, making it difficult to ascertain its exact meaning. Consequently, our conclusion about the hypothesis is subject to the interpretations made on the premise. Additionally, the premise itself does not provide factual information about the group's composition; it is merely a question. Therefore, the truth of the hypothesis cannot be definitively established based on the premise alone. More context or information would be needed to validate or refute the hypothesis."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

So I am shuffled off to his office and of course after hearing what had a occurred and examining my foot agreed I needed the Tetanus shot. I make a very innocent request as he is about to give me the shot. Since I knew the shot would stiffen my arm and essentially cause pain I would take it in my left arm so my throwing arm would not be affected. I tried to request this from the doctor but he did not wish to hear anything from me. He said \\"I don't give a fuck what arm you get it in.\\" He grabbed me roughly by the right arm and used the needle like a dart and just slammed it into my arm.

Question: Which election year does the passage mention leading to Rahmon's second term in office? Context: The nation almost immediately fell into civil war that involved various factions fighting one another; these factions were often distinguished by clan loyalties. More than 500,000 residents fled during this time because of persecution, increased poverty and better economic opportunities in the West or in other former Soviet republics. Emomali Rahmon came to power in 1992, defeating former prime minister Abdumalik Abdullajanov in a November presidential election with 58% of the vote. The elections took place shortly after the end of the war, and Tajikistan was in a state of complete devastation. The estimated dead numbered over 100,000. Around 1.2 million people were refugees inside and outside of the country. In 1997, a ceasefire was reached between Rahmon and opposition parties under the guidance of Gerd D. Merrem, Special Representative to the Secretary General, a result widely praised as a successful United Nations peace keeping initiative. The ceasefire guaranteed 30% of ministerial positions would go to the opposition. Elections were held in 1999, though they were criticized by opposition parties and foreign observers as unfair and Rahmon was re-elected with 98% of the vote. Elections in 2006 were again won by Rahmon (with 79% of the vote) and he began his third term in office. Several opposition parties boycotted the 2006 election and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) criticized it, although observers from the Commonwealth of Independent States claimed the elections were legal and transparent. Rahmon's administration came under further criticism from the OSCE in October 2010 for its censorship and repression of the media. The OSCE claimed that the Tajik Government censored Tajik and foreign websites and instituted tax inspections on independent printing houses that led to the cessation of printing activities for a number of independent newspapers.

Write an article based on this \\"Do not let the half-halt last longer than one stride. Do not overdo the reins. Do not wait too long for the half-halt. Communicate clearly to the horse with your aids.\\" Article:","output":"Title: Mastering the Half-Halt: A Key Skill for Effective Communication with Your Horse Introduction Equestrian communication is a critical aspect of horsemanship, and among various techniques, the half-halt stands out as an essential tool for riders of all levels. A well-executed half-halt helps to maintain balance, regulate pace, and prepare the horse for upcoming movements. Mastering the half-halt promotes a harmonious relationship between rider and horse, ensuring a more enjoyable experience for both. In this article, we will discuss the importance of not letting the half-halt last longer than one stride, avoiding overusing the reins, timely execution, and effectively using your aids to communicate with your horse. 1. Keep the half-halt short and concise The half-halt should be a brief correction, lasting no more than one stride. By keeping the half-halt short, you ensure that your horse remains responsive and attentive without becoming confused or overwhelmed. A prolonged half-halt hinders the horse's forward movement and disrupts its rhythm, leading to a loss of momentum and balance. By executing a quick and concise half-halt, you send a clear signal to your horse that enables better communication and improved performance. 2. Be mindful of rein usage Reins serve as a vital communication tool for horse and rider, but it is essential to avoid relying on them excessively during the execution of a half-halt. Overuse of the reins can lead to a dull or unresponsive horse that is less likely to understand your cues. Instead, focus on utilizing your seat, legs, and body weight to transmit your message effectively, using the reins only when necessary as a supporting aid. Striking a balance between rein usage and other aids ensures clearer communication and a more responsive horse. 3. Do not wait too long to initiate the half-halt Timing is crucial when executing a half-halt. It is essential to give the cue promptly, as waiting too long may cause the horse to lose balance or rhythm and make it challenging to execute the desired movement. Developing a keen sense of timing is a skill that improves with practice and experience. By understanding your horse's natural rhythm and being mindful of the appropriate moment to apply a half-halt, you will enhance your horse's responsiveness and overall performance. 4. Communicate clearly using your aids To be successful in executing a half-halt, it is crucial to communicate effectively with your horse using your aids. Practicing clear communication will help your horse understand your intentions and give you better control during your rides. Ensure consistent contact with your horse through your seat, legs, and hands. Maintain a steady connection and engage your core muscles, while also being conscious of your position and posture. These efforts will make it easier for your horse to comprehend your cues and respond accordingly. Conclusion Incorporating mindful execution, precise timing, and effective use of aids in your half-halts significantly enhances communication with your horse, leading to improved performance and a stronger bond between horse and rider. As you continue to practice and refine your half-halts, you will find this essential skill invaluable in successfully navigating your equestrian journey. Remember, it takes time, commitment, and patience to develop this crucial skill, but the reward is a harmonious partnership that lasts a lifetime."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This one comes from Selina from Beautystorm. Beautystorm are proudly the cheapest stockists of Dermalogica products in Australia and provide online skin consultations with their in house Skincare Therapists. Selina will be giving us advice on how to repair sun damaged skin. Whilst we are blessed to be living in such a sun drenched country, here in Australia, as a consequence the majority of us will have sun damaged skin. Here are Selina's tips to repair some of the damage: The severe, Australian suncauses a multitude of cases of serious skin damage every year. However, there are ways, to repair rough, dry, wrinkled skin that may also suffer from redness and brown spots. The very first step to reverse some of that skin damage is some gentle cleansing. Never wash the face with an ordinary bar of soap. This will make the situation worse and cause severe dry skin. In order to wash the sun-damaged skin effectively without causing further injury, use a gentle exfoliating facial cleanser. This will remove, not only dirt and oil, but also the top layer of dead skin cells, providing a nice glow. This will reveal fresh skin cells ready for treatment. After cleansing the skin, follow with a mud mask or a facial mask made specifically for skin that’s been damaged by the sun. The purpose of a mask is to draw out impurities in the skin while adding key ingredients like moisturisers and minerals back into the skin.  After gently rinsing the purifying mask, a lotion, cream or serum containing key ingredients should be applied to the skin. The difference between the three is that a lotion is best for daytime use, worn under makeup or for those prone to breakouts. Creams are considered heavier and best used at night or for those with dry skin. Serums are usually highly concentrated formulas that can be used day or night, but a little goes a long way. Those with the most severe sun damaged skin should use them.

Likewise, fewer buds imply that there might be less vegetation growth in the area. Ultimately, this could lead to decreased plant root structure and overall plant cover, which could in turn weaken the soil structure and stability in beach or coastal areas. When the soil structure is weakened, and there's less vegetation to help keep it together, it might exacerbate the erosion process caused by ocean waves, winds, and currents. In this case, the beach or coastal area may experience more rapid erosion, making the landscape more vulnerable to the ocean's forces. In summary, while the perturbation hypothesis involving less mycelium and buds doesn't have a direct effect on ocean erosion, it could potentially have indirect effects on the process by influencing soil structure and stability. These changes might lead to increased vulnerability of coastal areas to erosion caused by ocean waves, winds, and currents."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Andrew Jackson (March 15, 1767 - June 8, 1845) was an American soldier and statesman who served as the seventh president of the United States from 1829 to 1837. Before being elected to the presidency, Jackson gained fame as a general in the United States Army and served in both houses of Congress. As president, Jackson sought to advance the rights of the \\"common man\\" against a \\"corrupt aristocracy\\" and to preserve the Union. Born in the colonial Carolinas to a Scotch-Irish family in the decade before the American Revolutionary War, Jackson became a frontier lawyer and married Rachel Donelson Robards. Andrew Jackson was born on March 15, 1767, in the Waxhaws region of the Carolinas. His parents were Scots-Irish colonists Andrew and Elizabeth Hutchinson Jackson, Presbyterians who had emigrated from present day Northern Ireland two years earlier. Jackson's father was born in Carrickfergus, County Antrim, in current-day Northern Ireland, around 1738. Jackson's parents lived in the village of Boneybefore, also in County Antrim. His paternal family line originated in Killingswold Grove, Yorkshire, England.  When they immigrated to North America in 1765, Jackson's parents probably landed in Philadelphia. Most likely they traveled overland through the Appalachian Mountains to the Scots-Irish community in the Waxhaws, straddling the border between North and South Carolina. They brought two children from Ireland, Hugh (born 1763) and Robert (born 1764). Jackson's father died in a logging accident while clearing land in February 1767 at the age of 29, three weeks before his son Andrew was born. Jackson, his mother, and his brothers lived with Jackson's aunt and uncle in the Waxhaws region, and Jackson received schooling from two nearby priests.  Jackson's exact birthplace is unclear because of a lack of knowledge of his mother's actions immediately following her husband's funeral. The area was so remote that the border between North and South Carolina had not been officially surveyed. In 1824 Jackson wrote a letter saying that he was born on the plantation of his uncle James Crawford in Lancaster County, South Carolina. Jackson may have claimed to be a South Carolinian because the state was considering nullification of the Tariff of 1824, which he opposed. In the mid-1850s, second-hand evidence indicated that he might have been born at a different uncle's home in North Carolina.  In 1794, Jackson formed a partnership with fellow lawyer John Overton, dealing in claims for land reserved by treaty for the Cherokee and Chickasaw. Like many of their contemporaries, they dealt in such claims although the land was in Indian country. Most of the transactions involved grants made under the 'land grab' act of 1783 that briefly opened Indian lands west of the Appalachians within North Carolina to claim by that state's residents. He was one of the three original investors who founded Memphis, Tennessee, in 1819.  After moving to Nashville, Jackson became a protege of William Blount, a friend of the Donelsons and one of the most powerful men in the territory. Jackson became attorney general in 1791, and he won election as a delegate to the Tennessee constitutional convention in 1796. When Tennessee achieved statehood that year, he was elected its only U.S. Representative. He was a member of the Democratic-Republican Party, the dominant party in Tennessee. Jackson soon became associated with the more radical, pro-French and anti-British wing. He strongly opposed the Jay Treaty and criticized George Washington for allegedly removing Republicans from public office. Jackson joined several other Republican congressmen in voting against a resolution of thanks for Washington, a vote that would later haunt him when he sought the presidency. In 1797, the state legislature elected him as U.S. Senator. Jackson seldom participated in debate and found the job dissatisfying. He pronounced himself \\"disgusted with the administration\\" of President John Adams and resigned the following year without explanation. Upon returning home, with strong support from western Tennessee, he was elected to serve as a judge of the Tennessee Supreme Court at an annual salary of 600. Jackson's service as a judge is generally viewed as a success and earned him a reputation for honesty and good decision making. Jackson resigned the judgeship in 1804. His official reason for resigning was ill health. He had been suffering financially from poor land ventures, and so it is also possible that he wanted to return full-time to his business interests.  After arriving in Tennessee, Jackson won the appointment of judge advocate of the Tennessee militia. In 1802, while serving on the Tennessee Supreme Court, he declared his candidacy for major general, or commander, of the Tennessee militia, a position voted on by the officers. At that time, most free men were members of the militia. The organizations, intended to be called up in case of conflict with Europeans or Indians, resembled large social clubs. Jackson saw it as a way to advance his stature. With strong support from western Tennessee, he tied with John Sevier with seventeen votes. Sevier was a popular Revolutionary War veteran and former governor, the recognized leader of politics in eastern Tennessee. On February 5, Governor Archibald Roane broke the tie in Jackson's favor. Jackson had also presented Roane with evidence of land fraud against Sevier. Subsequently, in 1803, when Sevier announced his intention to regain the governorship, Roane released the evidence. Sevier insulted Jackson in public, and the two nearly fought a duel over the matter. Despite the charges leveled against Sevier, he defeated Roane, and continued to serve as governor until 1809.  After arriving in New Orleans on December 1, 1814, Jackson instituted martial law in the city, as he worried about the loyalty of the city's Creole and Spanish inhabitants. At the same time, he formed an alliance with Jean Lafitte's smugglers, and formed military units consisting of African-Americans and Muscogees, in addition to recruiting volunteers in the city. Jackson received some criticism for paying white and non-white volunteers the same salary. These forces, along with U.S. Army regulars and volunteers from surrounding states, joined with Jackson's force in defending New Orleans. The approaching British force, led by Admiral Alexander Cochrane and later General Edward Pakenham, consisted of over 10,000 soldiers, many of whom had served in the Napoleonic Wars. Jackson only had about 5,000 men, most of whom were inexperienced and poorly trained.  The British arrived on the east bank of the Mississippi River on the morning of December 23. That evening, Jackson attacked the British and temporarily drove them back. On January 8, 1815, the British launched a major frontal assault against Jackson's defenses. An initial artillery barrage by the British did little damage to the well-constructed American defenses. Once the morning fog had cleared, the British launched a frontal assault, and their troops made easy targets for the Americans protected by their parapets. Despite managing to temporarily drive back the American right flank, the overall attack ended in disaster. For the battle on January 8, Jackson admitted to only 71 total casualties. Of these, 13 men were killed, 39 wounded, and 19 missing or captured. The British admitted 2,037 casualties. Of these, 291 men were killed (including Pakenham), 1,262 wounded, and 484 missing or captured. After the battle, the British retreated from the area, and open hostilities ended shortly thereafter when word spread that the Treaty of Ghent had been signed in Europe that December. Coming in the waning days of the war, Jackson's victory made him a national hero, as the country celebrated the end of what many called the \\"Second American Revolution\\" against the British. By a Congressional resolution on February 27, 1815, Jackson was given the Thanks of Congress and awarded a Congressional Gold Medal.  Alexis de Tocqueville (\\"underwhelmed\\" by Jackson according to a 2001 commentator) later wrote in Democracy in America that Jackson \\"was raised to the Presidency, and has been maintained there, solely by the recollection of a victory which he gained, twenty years ago, under the walls of New Orleans.\\" Did they win the battle","output":"Yes, Andrew Jackson and his troops won the Battle of New Orleans. Jackson's forces successfully defended the city against the British attack on January 8, 1815.

Writing for the majority, Justice Stephen Johnson Field cited Jefferson's Letter to the Danbury Baptists to state that \\"Congress was deprived of all legislative power over mere opinion, but was left free to reach actions which were in violation of social duties or subversive of good order.\\" Considering this, the court ruled that outlawing polygamy was constitutional. What was the topic of Reynolds v. U.S.?","output":"Reynolds v. U.S. was a landmark Supreme Court case that took place in 1878, addressing the topic of polygamy and the extent to which religious freedom is protected under the Constitution. The issue at hand was whether the federal government had the authority to outlaw polygamy, even when practiced as a part of an individual's religious beliefs. The case involved George Reynolds, a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, commonly known as the Mormon Church. Reynolds was charged with bigamy, the act of marrying one person while still being legally married to another, which was a violation of the federal Morrill Anti-Bigamy Act of 1862. He defended his actions by arguing that his religious beliefs required him to practice polygamy, and thus the federal law infringed on his First Amendment rights to freedom of religion. In its decision, the Supreme Court sought to establish a clear distinction between the protection of religious beliefs and the regulation of actions resulting from those beliefs. As you mentioned, the court cited Thomas Jefferson's Letter to the Danbury Baptists and James Madison's writings to argue that the First Amendment was intended to safeguard individual's religious opinions, but not necessarily their actions based on those opinions. Justice Stephen Johnson Field, writing for the majority, found that the government was allowed to take action against behaviors that it deemed to be \\"in violation of social duties or subversive of good order.\\" The Court held that while religious beliefs were protected, the actions that stemmed from them, such as the practice of polygamy, could be restricted by the government if they were found to be a threat to the welfare of society. Consequently, the Supreme Court ruled that outlawing polygamy was constitutional, upholding Reynolds' conviction, and setting a precedent for the government's ability to regulate certain actions, even when they are grounded in religious beliefs.

The statement suggests the opposite – that the town appears more visually pleasing or charming when observed from a distance. Camara de Lobos is a beautiful town on the southern coast of Madeira, Portugal, with a stunning natural bay and a rich history. It has a picturesque appearance from afar due to several factors, such as its colorful buildings, the dramatic cliffs and the green mountain backdrop, the reflection of the town on the calm waters of the bay, and the overall harmony of nature and humanity living side by side. However, when viewed up close, some aspects of the town might not be as appealing as they appear from a distance. One might encounter worn-out building exteriors, narrow streets, and perhaps some untidy areas. Despite these imperfections, the local culture, vibrant fishing community, and history still have a unique charm that draws tourists. In conclusion, since the statement posits that \\"Camara de Lobos is more picturesque from afar than it is up close,\\" we cannot then conclude that it is more picturesque up close than from a distance. Instead, the observation suggests that while the town's overall beauty and charm are evident, details that may not be as visually pleasing become apparent upon closer inspection. However, appreciating Camara de Lobos's charm might involve embracing not only the observable beauty from afar but also the authenticity and cultural richness up close."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer is:","output":"To answer this question, let's analyze the information about both Pauline Kael and Christa Wolf step by step: Step 1: Identify who Pauline Kael and Christa Wolf are. Pauline Kael was an American film critic who wrote for The New Yorker magazine from 1968 to 1991. She was known for her in-depth and witty reviews of films. Christa Wolf was a German literary critic, novelist, and essayist who focused on contemporary issues and the difficulties of East Germans in adapting to their new surroundings after the fall of the Berlin Wall. Step 2: Determine if they were critics of artistic works. Pauline Kael was a film critic, which means she critiqued artistic works, specifically films. This makes her a critic of artistic works. Christa Wolf was primarily a novelist and essayist, but she also engaged in literary criticism, which is the evaluation and interpretation of literary works. This makes her a critic of artistic works as well, although her focus was more on literature. Step 3: Combine the facts and create the answer. Based on our analysis, both Pauline Kael and Christa Wolf were critics of artistic works, although their areas of focus were different, with Kael specializing in film and Wolf in literature.

They spent time discussing actors Jason Statham and Sylvester Stallone, who are both well-known for their roles in many action movies. Indeed, Fisher mentions that they would watch any movie with these actors, regardless of the film’s ratings or reviews—a clear indicator of their strong preference for these actors. Their conversation revolves around movies in which either Jason Statham or Sylvester Stallone has acted. First, Zuri asked Fisher if they have seen the Transporter and the Expendables. The Transporter is a popular action movie series starring Jason Statham, while the Expendables is an ensemble action film series featuring Sylvester Stallone among other high-profile action stars. Fisher confirmed that they have watched these movies several times to the point of losing count. This not only re-emphasizes their affection for the actors but also their preference for action movies. Next, they discuss the possibility of watching High Voltage.

Fisher invites Zuri to come to their place, implying to watch High Voltage—a movie Zuri expressed interest in but has not yet seen. Zuri accepts the invitation, affirming that they will come alone as Fisher specified.

Displayed with eight differing viewpoints, an assassination attempt on the president occurs, relayed in a time span of 23 minutes. Each time the events unfold from the beginning, a new vantage point is shown revealing additional details, which ultimately completes the story of what actually took place during the incident.[2] From the first vantage point, GNN producer Rex Brooks (Weaver), directs various media personnel from a mobile television studio as the president arrives at the gathering. Mayor De Soto (Rodriguez) delivers a short speech and then introduces the president, who is shot twice as he greets the crowd from the podium. An explosion outside the plaza soon follows. Moments later, the podium itself is destroyed by a secondary explosion, killing and injuring numerous people. As the smoke clears, GNN reporter Angie Jones (Saldana) is seen lying dead in the rubble.[2] The second vantage point follows Secret Service agents Thomas Barnes (Quaid) and Kent Taylor (Fox). Barnes notices a curtain fluttering in the window of a nearby building that was allegedly vacated. He also observes American tourist Howard Lewis (Whitaker) filming the audience. After the president is shot, Barnes tackles a man rushing to the podium named Enrique (Noriega). Taylor pursues a lead to a potential assassin. Following the second explosion, Barnes barges into the GNN production studio and asks to view their footage. He calls Taylor, who reports the direction of the suspected assassin's escape route. Barnes then views an image on one of the camera's live feeds that startles him and prompts him to run out.[2] In the third vantage point, Enrique, a Spanish police officer assigned to protecting the mayor of Salamanca, sees his girlfriend Veronica (Zurer), being embraced by a stranger and overhears them speaking about meeting under an overpass.

News article:      A map of the world's countries by most and least emotional. Click to enlarge. (Max Fisher)      Since 2009, the Gallup polling firm has surveyed people in 150 countries and territories on, among other things, their daily emotional experience. Their survey asks five questions, meant to gauge whether the respondent felt significant positive or negative emotions the day prior to the survey. The more times that people answer \\"yes\\" to questions such as \\"Did you smile or laugh a lot yesterday?\\", the more emotional they're deemed to be.      Gallup has tallied up the average \\"yes\\" responses from respondents in almost every country on Earth. The results, which I've mapped out above, are as fascinating as they are indecipherable. The color-coded key in the map indicates the average percentage of people who answered \\"yes.\\" Dark purple countries are the most emotional, yellow the least. Here are a few takeaways.      Singapore is the least emotional country in the world. \\"Singaporeans recognize they have a problem,\\" Bloomberg Businessweek writes of the country's \\"emotional deficit,\\" citing a culture in which schools \\"discourage students from thinking of themselves as individuals.\\" They also point to low work satisfaction, competitiveness, and the urban experience: \\"Staying emotionally neutral could be a way of coping with the stress of urban life in a place where 82 percent of the population lives in government-built housing.\\"      The Philippines is the world's most emotional country. It's not even close; the heavily Catholic, Southeast Asian nation, a former colony of Spain and the U.S., scores well above second-ranked El Salvador.      Post-Soviet countries are consistently among the most stoic. Other than Singapore (and, for some reason, Madagascar and Nepal), the least emotional countries in the world are all former members of the Soviet Union. They are also the greatest consumers of cigarettes and alcohol. This could be what you call and chicken-or-egg problem: if the two trends are related, which one came first? Europe appears almost like a gradient here, with emotions increasing as you move West.      People in the Americas are just exuberant. Every nation on the North and South American continents ranked highly on the survey. Americans and Canadians are both among the 15 most emotional countries in the world, as well as ten Latin countries. The only non-American countries in the top 15, other than the Philippines, are the Arab nations of Oman and Bahrain, both of which rank very highly.      English- and Spanish-speaking societies tend to be highly emotional and happy. Though the Anglophone nations of the world retain deep cultural links, it's not clear if Spain's emotional depth has anything to do with Latin America's. According to Gallup, \\"Latin America leads the world when it comes to positive emotions, with Panama, Paraguay, and Venezuela at the top of that list.\\" Yes, even Hugo Chavez's Venezuela is apparently filled with happy people.      Africans are generally stoic, with some significant exceptions. The continent is among the world's least emotional, though there is wide variation, which serves as a non-definitive but interesting reminder of Africa's cultural diversity. Each could be its own captivating case study. It's possible that South Africa's high rating has to do with its cultural ties to Western Europe, for example, and Nigeria's may have to do with the recent protest movement in the south and sectarian violence in the north.      The Middle East is not happy. Gallup notes, \\"Negative emotions are highest in the Middle East and North Africa, with Iraq, Bahrain, and the Palestinian Territories leading the world in negative daily experiences.\\" Still, that doesn't quite fully explain the high emotions in the Levant and on the Arabian peninsula, compared to the lower emotions in Libya, Algeria, and Morocco. Perhaps this hints at how people in these countries are being affected by the still-ongoing political turmoil of the Arab Spring.      What am I missing? Every color-coded national boundary here tells a story. Why is Haiti so bereft of emotion compared to its neighbors? Why is Angola so heavy with feeling? Leave your thoughts in the comments or reach me on social media. ||||| WASHINGTON, D.C. -- Singaporeans are the least likely in the world to report experiencing emotions of any kind on a daily basis. The 36% who report feeling either positive or negative emotions is the lowest in the world. Filipinos, on the other hand, are the most emotional, with six in 10 saying they experience a lot of these feelings daily.      See the full list of countries on page 2.      Gallup measures daily emotions in more than 150 countries and areas by asking residents whether they experienced five positive and five negative emotions a lot the previous day. Negative experiences include anger, stress, sadness, physical pain, and worry. Positive emotions include feeling well-rested, being treated with respect, enjoyment, smiling and laughing a lot, and learning or doing something interesting.      To measure the presence or absence of emotions, Gallup averaged together the percentage of residents in each country who said they experienced each of the 10 positive and negative emotions.      Negative emotions are highest in the Middle East and North Africa, with Iraq, Bahrain, and the Palestinian Territories leading the world in negative daily experiences. Latin America leads the world when it comes to positive emotions, with Panama, Paraguay, and Venezuela at the top of that list.      Implications      Behavioral indicators such as positive and negative emotions are a vital measure of a society's wellbeing. Leaders worldwide are starting to incorporate such behavioral-based indicators into the metrics they use to evaluate their countries because they realize that traditional economic indicators such as GDP and 40-hour workweeks alone do not, and cannot, quantify the human condition.      While higher incomes may improve people's emotional wellbeing, they can only do so to a certain extent. In the United States, for example, Nobel Prize-winning economist Daniel Kahneman and Princeton economist Angus Deaton found that after individuals make 75,000 annually, additional income will have little meaningful effect on how they experience their lives. Consider this finding in the context of Singapore, a country with one of the lowest unemployment rates and highest GDP per capita rates in the world, but a place where residents barely experience any positive emotions. This research shows that it will take more than higher incomes to increase positive emotions or decrease negative emotions. Singapore leadership needs to consider strategies that lie outside of the traditional confines of classic economics and would be well-advised to include wellbeing in its overall strategies if it is going to further improve the lives of its citizenry.      Read more about Singapore's emotion deficit in Bloomberg Businessweek.      For complete data sets or custom research from the more than 150 countries Gallup continually surveys, please contact us.      Survey Methods      Results are based on telephone and face-to-face interviews with approximately 1,000 adults, aged 15 and older, in each country each year between 2009 and 2011. For results based on the total sample of national adults, one can say with 95% confidence that the maximum margin of sampling error ranges from ±0.4 percentage points to ±3.8 percentage points. The margin of error reflects the influence of data weighting. In addition to sampling error, question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls.

Each of those parts will have some instruction. Explain their meaning by showing an example that meets the criteria in the instruction. Use the following format: Part  # : a key part of the definition. Usage: Sample response that meets the criteria from the key part. Explain why you think it meets the criteria. Given the prompt and a response, classify the them to \\"yes\\" if response is \\"yes, and\\" type. Otherwise classify it as \\"no\\". \\"Yes, and\\" is a rule-of-thumb in improvisational comedy that suggests that a participant in a dialogue should accept what another participant has stated (\\"Yes\\") and then expand on that line of thought or context (\\"and...\\"). 1 In short, a \\"Yes, and\\" is a dialogue exchange in which a speaker responds by adding new information on top of the information/setting that was constructed by another speaker. Note that a \\"Yes, and\\" does not require someone explicitly saying 'yes, and...' as part of a dialogue exchange, although it could be the case if it agrees with the description above. There are many ways in which a response could implicitly/explicitly agree to the prompt without specifically saying 'yes, and...'.  Q: Prompt: I want to garnish it with some nice, nice vegetables.

It's a bucket for two.\\" This part essentially requires identifying the two main components of the task, the prompt and the response to it. Part #2: Understand the concept of \\"Yes, and\\" in the context of a dialogue. Usage: \\"Yes, and\\" would mean that the respondent accepts or agrees with the statement and adds new information. An instance of this could be, if the response was \\"Yes, those fresh veggies would be perfect for a salad and they'd also taste wonderful in a summer broth.\\" Here, the respondent is agreeing with using the veggies (the 'Yes') and adding new information by suggesting their usage in a broth (the 'and'). Part #3: Determine if the response is a \\"Yes, and\\" type.  Usage: The response \\"Probably Poseidon's Delight. It's a pretty big bucket. It's a bucket for two.\\" does not fit the \\"Yes, and\\" type. It does not affirm/accept the prior dialogue about garnishing with vegetables, nor does it add to the idea with new information.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the name of the song that was a top ten hit in the UK from the David Live album?, using the article: Bowie moved to the US in 1974, initially staying in New York City before settling in Los Angeles. Diamond Dogs (1974), parts of which found him heading towards soul and funk, was the product of two distinct ideas: a musical based on a wild future in a post-apocalyptic city, and setting George Orwell's 1984 to music. The album went to number one in the UK, spawning the hits \\"Rebel Rebel\\" and \\"Diamond Dogs\\", and No. 5 in the US. To promote it, Bowie launched the Diamond Dogs Tour, visiting cities in North America between June and December 1974. Choreographed by Toni Basil, and lavishly produced with theatrical special effects, the high-budget stage production was filmed by Alan Yentob. The resulting documentary, Cracked Actor, featured a pasty and emaciated Bowie: the tour coincided with the singer's slide from heavy cocaine use into addiction, producing severe physical debilitation, paranoia, and emotional problems. He later commented that the accompanying live album, David Live, ought to have been titled \\"David Bowie Is Alive and Well and Living Only in Theory\\". David Live nevertheless solidified Bowie's status as a superstar, charting at No. 2 in the UK and No. 8 in the US. It also spawned a UK No. 10 hit in Bowie's cover of Eddie Floyd's \\"Knock on Wood\\". After a break in Philadelphia, where Bowie recorded new material, the tour resumed with a new emphasis on soul. Matters came to a head in London in May in what became known as the \\"Victoria Station incident\\". Arriving in an open-top Mercedes convertible, Bowie waved to the crowd in a gesture that some alleged was a Nazi salute, which was captured on camera and published in NME. Bowie said the photographer caught him in mid-wave. He later blamed his pro-fascism comments and his behaviour during the period on his addictions and the character of the Thin White Duke. \\"I was out of my mind, totally crazed. The main thing I was functioning on was mythology ... that whole thing about Hitler and Rightism ... I'd discovered King Arthur\\". According to playwright Alan..., what would be the answer ? Answer:","output":"The song that was a top ten hit in the UK from the David Live album is Bowie's cover of Eddie Floyd's \\"Knock on Wood\\".  The reasoning behind this is simple: the information given in the article specifies that the David Live album \\"spawned a UK No. 10 hit in Bowie's cover of Eddie Floyd's 'Knock on Wood'\\".

Use a putty knife to scrape off any raised fragments around the holes. Smooth down the nail holes with fine-grit sandpaper.\\"","output":"Title: A Step-by-Step Guide to Repairing and Refinishing Wood Trim Introduction: Maintaining the appearance and functionality of wood trim is essential for preserving the beauty and value of your home. Once in a while, you may find protruding nails or cracks in your trim that can be unsightly and even lead to further damage if left unattended. In this article, we will discuss in detail how to hammer in protruding nails, remove raised fragments, and smooth down nail holes in your wood trim using a nail set, a putty knife, and fine-grit sandpaper. Step 1: Inspect the Trim The first step is to thoroughly inspect the trim to identify areas where nails may be protruding or where there are any raised fragments around the nail holes. Pay attention to corners and joints where movement or shifting is more likely to occur. Step 2: Gather Your Tools To repair the trim, you will need a few essential tools. These include: 1. A nail set 2. A hammer 3. A putty knife 4. Fine-grit sandpaper 5. Wood filler or putty, if necessary 6. Safety goggles and gloves for protection Make sure you have these tools ready before you start the repair process. Step 3: Hammer in Protruding Nails Put on your safety goggles and gloves, as small fragments or debris may become airborne during this process. Once you have identified a protruding nail, place the narrow end of the nail set on the nailhead. Hold the nail set securely with one hand and gently tap the other end of the nail set with the hammer. This will push the nail back into the trim and below the wood surface. Make sure to hammer the nail gently to avoid causing damage to the trim or to the surrounding wall. Step 4: Scrape off Raised Fragments Next, take your putty knife and gently scrape away any raised fragments around the nail holes. Be careful not to gouge the wood or scratch the surrounding surfaces. The goal is only to remove loose or splintered wood that may have been forced up by the protruding nail. Step 5: Sand Down Nail Holes Using the fine-grit sandpaper, gently sand down the nail holes and the area around them to create a smooth, even finish. Sanding will remove any remaining raised fragments and will prepare the surface for any additional touch-ups or refinishing if required. Step 6: Apply Wood Filler (Optional) If desired, you can use wood filler or putty to fill in the nail holes and gaps in the trim. Follow the manufacturer's instructions to apply and allow it to dry according to the recommended drying time. After the filler has dried, you can use fine-grit sandpaper to sand it down to ensure a seamless finish. Step 7: Refinish the Trim (Optional) If necessary, apply a fresh coat of paint or stain to the trim that matches the existing finish. Be sure to follow proper application techniques and use a high-quality paintbrush or sponge for an even, professional-looking result. Once the paint or stain is dry, your trim will look freshly installed and seamlessly integrated into your home. Conclusion: Maintaining and repairing your wood trim is essential for preserving the beauty and value of your home. By following these steps, you can effectively hammer in any protruding nails, remove raised fragments, and sand down nail holes in your trim to ensure it remains in top-tier condition. With a few essential tools, a little time, and attention to detail, you can transform and maintain the appearance of your trim and give your home a polished, well-cared-for appearance."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Once I find relevant information about \\"Freedom+\\", I would then summarize the findings to provide a concise definition. --- Task 2: Determine the freedoms women have. Step 1: Understand the context. Recognize that women's freedoms vary widely depending on the cultural, political, economic, and social context. The inquiry is broad, as it does not specify a particular location or time period. Step 2: Provide a general overview. Given the broad nature of the question, I would provide an overview of some key freedoms that women have generally fought for and achieved throughout history, such as voting rights, property ownership, reproductive rights, equal pay, etc. Note that these freedoms may not be universally enjoyed by all women. --- Task 3: Determine whether the two questions have the same meaning. Step 1: Analyze the message of both questions. Upon reviewing the questions, I can see that they are asking different things. The first question is related to the term \\"Freedom+\\", which is likely about enhanced freedom in a particular context, without any specific mention of women. The second question is focused on the freedoms women have. Step 2: Compare the subject matter. The primary subjects in these questions differ—the first is focused on defining a term or concept, while the second centers around specific freedoms for women. Step 3: Provide a conclusion. Based on the analysis and comparison, I can conclude that the two questions do not have the same meaning, as they address different subjects and seek different information."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the last name of the person who suffered heart attacks in 1966 and again in 1971?, using the article: In 1964 Shostakovich composed the music for the Russian film Hamlet, which was favourably reviewed by The New York Times: \\"But the lack of this aural stimulation – of Shakespeare's eloquent words – is recompensed in some measure by a splendid and stirring musical score by Dmitri Shostakovich. This has great dignity and depth, and at times an appropriate wildness or becoming levity\\".In later life, Shostakovich suffered from chronic ill health, but he resisted giving up cigarettes and vodka. Beginning in 1958 he suffered from a debilitating condition that particularly affected his right hand, eventually forcing him to give up piano playing; in 1965 it was diagnosed as poliomyelitis. He also suffered heart attacks the following year and again in 1971, and several falls in which he broke both his legs; in 1967 he wrote in a letter: \\"Target achieved so far: 75% (right leg broken, left leg broken, right hand defective). All I need to do now is wreck the left hand and then 100% of my extremities will be out of order.\\"A preoccupation with his own mortality permeates Shostakovich's later works, among them the later quartets and the Fourteenth Symphony of 1969 (a song cycle based on a number of poems on the theme of death). This piece also finds Shostakovich at his most extreme with musical language, with twelve-tone themes and dense polyphony throughout. He dedicated the piece to his close friend Benjamin Britten, who conducted its Western premiere at the 1970 Aldeburgh Festival. The Fifteenth Symphony of 1971 is, by contrast, melodic and retrospective in nature, quoting Wagner, Rossini and the composer's own Fourth Symphony. Shostakovich died of lung cancer on 9 August 1975. A civic funeral was held; he was interred in Novodevichy Cemetery, Moscow. Even before his death he had been commemorated with the naming of the Shostakovich Peninsula on Alexander Island, Antarctica., Despite suffering from Motor Neurone Disease (or ALS) from as early as the 1960s, Shostakovich insisted upon writing all his own correspondence..., what would be the answer ? Answer:","output":"The answer is Shostakovich. The person who suffered from heart attacks in 1966 and again in 1971, as mentioned in the given text, is named Dmitri Shostakovich. Therefore, Shostakovich is his last name. The text provides information about Shostakovich's health challenges, including suffering from multiple heart attacks in the mentioned years.

Apple's iPhone 6 saves the day for Best Buy Best Buy BBY gave investors’ another pleasant surprise on Thursday, this time in part courtesy of Apple’s AAPL iPhone 6. The retailer, which many analysts for years had written off as a relic destined to disappear, keeps coming back with strong results, defying conventional wisdom and maintaining its appeal with shoppers who could easily buy its electronics on line. Best Buy on Thursday reported U.S. comparable sales unexpectedly rose 0.6% in the quarter ended May 3, easily beating Wall Street forecasts for a 0.4% decline, according to Consensus Metrix, and helping it post a stronger than expected profit. It’s not the first time that electronics retailer benefit from a runaway hit, of course, but Best Buy has in the last few years positioned itself to benefit better than most from such blockbuster products. “We continued to take advantage of strong product cycles in large screen televisions and iconic mobile phones,” said CEO Hubert Joly said. Those iconic mobile phones would of course largely be the iPhone 6, launched last winter, as well as Samsung’s Galaxy 6. Best Buy also got some help from large TVs and its growing big appliance business (that it appears to be taking in part from Sears SHLD ). The retailer has been fighting back using the very thing people thought condemned it to obsolescence: its stores. The chain’s growth plan is anchored on focusing on top brands in electronics and giving them a lot more prominence in stores. In 2014, it opened showrooms within its stores to showcase case products by Sony and Samsung. It has also previously had shop-in-shops for products by Microsoft MSFT and Beats headphones. And it has done a stellar job of integrating its e-commerce and stores for services like in-store pickup for online orders. These are some of reasons hit products like the iPhone have helped Best Buy but not RadioShack or hhgregg. This “is what has allowed us to consistently outperform the market,” Joly said. The strong quarter follows a big rise in U.S. sales over the holiday season, belying the long held notion that Best Buy can’t keep up with the aggressive pricing of Amazon.com, AMZN Walmart WMT and Target TGT . There was more good news from Best Buy: total company sales for the current quarter are set to decline less than Wall Street analysts expected (Best Buy is in the process of exiting China, and closing dozens of Canadian stores) because of what Chief Financial Officer Sharon McCollam called “a strengthening domestic consumer-electronics market.” Write a one or two sentence summary.","output":"Best Buy reported an unexpected rise in U.S. comparable sales, largely due to the strong sales of Apple's iPhone 6, large TVs, and its growing big appliance business. The retailer's growth strategy has been focused on showcasing top electronic brands in stores, expanding shop-in-shops, and integrating e-commerce and in-store services, enabling it to consistently outperform the market and defy the notion of obsolescence."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Santa Clara gets a sweeter offer from 49ers Santa Clara residents are now facing a much sweeter offer to build a 68,500-seat stadium for the San Francisco 49ers in the South Bay city than the team had suggested almost two years ago. The parameters of a complex deal hashed out between the city and team, released late Friday, call for Santa Clara to contribute 79 million toward the 937 million project, a major reduction from the 222 million in public contributions the team had sought in 2007. There would be no new taxes or money taken from the city's general fund. Instead, the bulk of the city's contribution would come from 42 million in redevelopment funds, which can be spent only on specific types of projects. \\"I think it's a great deal,\\" Santa Clara Mayor Patricia Mahan said. \\"This is an investment to get repaid. I do believe this is absolutely the best deal the city could have possibly negotiated.\\" City officials have touted the potential economic benefit of the stadium, including a projected 41 million annual injection into Santa Clara's economy and the creation of about 500 jobs, which critics have said would be largely low-paying. Whether the deal is good enough will be decided by Santa Clara voters, who will have the ultimate say on whether the project should go forward. If they do, it could mark the death knell for San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom's efforts to keep the team in the city with a new stadium as the centerpiece of a revitalized Hunters Point Naval Shipyard. Team officials are optimistic they will have a new game-day home next to their Santa Clara headquarters in time for the 2014 football season. \\"We're committed to making this work,\\" Niners Chief Financial Officer Larry MacNeil said. \\"We want to make this work, and we think we can make it work.\\" The proposal to relocate the five-time Super Bowl champions from the city where they've played their games since 1946 calls for public funds to subsidize about 8 percent of the project's costs, while having the team pay the city at least 1 million in rent a year on average for 40 years, plus millions more based on a cut of stadium revenue. Over the course of the 40-year lease, the team projects it will pay the city 196 million in rent. The team also would cover the cost of game-day law enforcement, any construction cost overruns, operating cost loses and front the city 12 million for the redevelopment fund if needed. The plan calls for the city to contribute 42 million from redevelopment funds, plus 20 million to move an electricity station at the proposed stadium site - one of two city-owned parking lots currently leased to the Great America theme park. The city portion also includes 17 million as part of the cost of building a parking garage at the site, although that money had already been raised because the garage was originally designed to serve the Santa Clara Convention Center across the street. An additional 35 million would come from a 2 percent tax on hotel guests, with the remaining 823 million coming from the team, the NFL, ticket fees and selling naming and concession rights. Skeptics of the plan have questioned whether the league, whose stadium fund was depleted last year, will pony up for a Santa Clara project. The league said Friday in a brief statement that it is pleased by they agreement and will \\"continue to facilitate support for new construction.\\" Some critics are concerned about an increase in traffic, while others oppose any public subsidy for a stadium. If approved, the deal would also trigger 141 million in funding for the Santa Clara Unified School District, team officials said, due to a provision in the use of redevelopment funds. It also calls for a 35-cent per-ticket surcharge that would generate about 250,000 annually for youth athletics, libraries and a senior center. \\"What I'm really excited about this deal is it takes redevelopment money and turns it into general fund money,\\" said City Councilman Kevin Moore, a leading proponent of trying to get the stadium. The next step comes Tuesday, when the Santa Clara City Council is set to take up the proposal at its meeting and potentially vote on whether to back it. City Manager Jennifer Sparacino and staff, who negotiated the deal, have recommended the package be approved. If it is, it would probably go before voters in March, by which time an environmental impact study is projected to be completed.","output":"Santa Clara is thinking about building a big stadium for the San Francisco 49ers football team. They talked about a plan to spend 79 million on the project, which will cost 937 million in total. This is much better than the 222 million they talked about two years ago. The money will come from special funds and not from new taxes. Some people think the stadium will be good for the city because it will bring more money and create jobs. The people of Santa Clara will vote if they want the stadium or not. If they say yes, the stadium might be finished by 2014."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Please tell me the sentiment of the following review: \\"In Cold Blood\\", adapted by director Richard Brooks from Truman Capote's famous novel, deals with the brutal and senseless murder of a family of four by a pair of hapless criminals. The film excels as a character study of the killers, particularly trigger-man Perry Smith (Robert Blake). The cast includes few recognizable names but they nevertheless bring the story to life with ease. Robert Blake and Scott Wilson are excellent together as two criminals with disparate personalities. They play off of each other effortlessly while Blake also gets plenty of opportunities to explore his character's idiosyncrasies. The rest of the cast is merely average and isn't worth remarking on. Richard Brooks received Oscar nominations for both his script and his direction. In my opinion, both were excellent, though the script does miscalculate with some ill-advised narration in the late stages. The Oscar-nominated cinematography by Conrad Hall is also top-notch, as is the editing. Also worthy of note is the jazzy score by Quincy Jones which secured the last of the film's four Oscar nominations. Unlike so many other crime films, this one doesn't glamorize violence. Brooks turns the killers into pitiable characters rather than flatly condemning them. Whether or not you agree with that sentiment the film does present an interesting alternative to the usual Hollywood approach. I recommend the film for this reason and also for the expertise with which the technical aspects are handled.","output":"The sentiment expressed in the review of \\"In Cold Blood\\" is primarily positive, with some minor critiques. The reviewer praises the film for its character study of the killers, particularly Perry Smith played by Robert Blake. The cast, despite not having many recognizable names, is commended for bringing the story to life. Both Robert Blake and Scott Wilson's performances are specifically applauded for their on-screen chemistry and dynamic portrayal of their characters. The reviewer also compliments Richard Brooks' script and direction, although mentioning a minor issue with some ill-advised narration in the later stages of the film. The cinematography by Conrad Hall, editing, and Quincy Jones' jazzy score are highly appreciated as well. One notable aspect of the review is the mention that the film does not glamorize violence, instead providing an alternative view on the killers, making them pitiable characters rather than flatly condemning them. While this might spark some disagreements, the reviewer appreciates that the movie presents a different approach from the typical Hollywood crime films. In conclusion, the sentiment of this review is predominantly positive, as the reviewer appreciates the character development, performances, and technical aspects of the film. The reviewer recommends the film, despite some minor issues mentioned, for its unique approach to crime and the excellence with which it is executed."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

OPAL is a high-level interface for low-level physics engines used in games , robotics simulations , and other 3D applications .","output":"While these two sentences appear to be very similar at first glance, they convey slightly different meanings due to the placement of hyphens and commas. 1. OPAL is a high-level interface for low - level - physics engines used in games, robotics simulations and other 3D applications. In this sentence, the placement of hyphens suggests that OPAL is a high-level interface designed for \\"low-level-physics\\" engines, which implies that the physics engines handle low-level physics specifically. The lack of an Oxford comma before \\"and other 3D applications\\" may lead to some ambiguity, as it could be interpreted as the \\"other 3D applications\\" being part of the \\"robotics simulations\\" category. However, this is a minor difference and might not have much impact on the overall interpretation of the sentence. 2. OPAL is a high-level interface for low-level physics engines used in games, robotics simulations, and other 3D applications. In this sentence, the absence of hyphens in \\"low-level physics\\" suggests that OPAL is a high-level interface for physics engines that are low-level, referring to the engines' abstraction level rather than the specific type of physics they handle. The inclusion of the Oxford comma before \\"and other 3D applications\\" clearly delineates the three different categories of applications where OPAL can be used: games, robotics simulations, and other 3D applications.

Considered a disciple of Vladimir Pashuto, Nazarenko advocates tighter integration of historiography with the auxiliary disciplines of genealogy, numismatics, and sigillography.

Imagine a ball bouncing off a surface. Light can do the same thing. That is, assuming the surface is shiny. So how do you know where light will go after it strikes a shiny surface? It depends on how the light initially strikes the shiny object. Light does not always go straight toward a surface. Therefore, not all light bounces straight back. Sometimes, light can hit a surface at an angle. The angle at which it strikes the surface tells us how it will bounce off. While light is different to a ball, they react in a similar manner. Many sports rely on knowledge of reflection. Pool players know a lot about reflection. They take great care when they strike the pool ball. They need it to go to a certain place.

What might be an extraordinary week for another president has quickly become “situation normal” for the man elected as the nation’s 45th chief executive. Trump wound up his chaotic week Friday by meeting with German Chancellor Merkel. During an Oval Office photo opportunity, Trump was eager to embrace a report from Republicans on the House Intelligence Committee that found no collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. “It was a great report. No collusion, which I knew anyway. No coordination, no nothing,” said Trump with Merkel looking on. “It is a witch hunt. That is all it is. No collusion with Russia, if you can believe this one.” Representative Adam Schiff, the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, issued a statement criticizing the Republican conclusions. Schiff asserted the committee did find evidence of collusion in “secret meetings and communications” between Trump campaign officials and others with links to the Russian government. The matter remains the focus of the investigation led by special counsel Robert Mueller. Earlier in the week, Trump bonded with French President Macron during a formal state visit that was noted for the warm physical interactions between the two leaders. “He is going to be an outstanding president. One of your great presidents and it is an honor to call you my friend. Thank you,” Trump told Macron at the end of their joint news conference.

Write an article based on this summary: The number of first-time buyers relying on the \\"bank of mum and dad\\" for financial help has hit a record high, according to new research.","output":"Title: First-time Home Buyers Turn to 'Bank of Mum and Dad' in Record Numbers Introduction The path to homeownership has become increasingly difficult for first-time buyers, with soaring property prices and an increasingly competitive housing market. In recent years, more and more aspiring homebuyers have turned to their families for financial assistance. According to new research, this trend has reached a record high, with an unprecedented number of first-time buyers relying on the so-called \\"bank of mum and dad\\" for help getting onto the property ladder. Soaring property prices The rise in the number of first-time buyers seeking help from family members is in large part due to skyrocketing property prices in the country. Over the last decade, the average price of a home has risen considerably, making it harder for many first-time buyers to save up for a deposit to secure a mortgage. The high cost of living, combined with the challenge of saving money while paying rent, has further compounded the problem. Housing market competition Another reason for the increased need for financial help from parents and other family members is the intense competition in the housing market. The demand for affordable and suitable properties far outstrips the supply, which has inevitably led to bidding wars and inflated prices. Prospective homeowners, particularly first-time buyers, often find it challenging to compete with those who have more financial resources at their disposal, such as property investors and second-home buyers. The role of the \\"bank of mum and dad\\" In light of these challenges, the \\"bank of mum and dad\\" has become an essential source of financial support for many aspiring homeowners. Parents and other family members are increasingly stepping in to help cover the costs of deposits and to provide financial guarantees, allowing first-time buyers to secure a mortgage and ultimately purchase a property. This trend has significant implications for both families and the wider property market. On the one hand, helping a family member onto the property ladder can be seen as a wise long-term investment that benefits both parties; the first-time buyer gains a valuable asset and the assisting family member can potentially see a return on investment in the form of increased property values. On the other hand, the reliance on family assistance can have its drawbacks. It can exacerbate socioeconomic inequality by benefiting those who already have access to financial support, perpetuating a cycle of wealth inequality. Additionally, the increasing dependence on the \\"bank of mum and dad\\" has raised concerns about the financial sustainability of such arrangements, particularly in cases where the helping family member may also be facing financial insecurity. Government measures to support first-time buyers Recognizing the challenges faced by first-time buyers, governments have introduced various measures to provide support, such as affordable housing schemes and mortgage guarantee programs. While these measures have helped some first-time buyers enter the property market, the high demand for assistance and the limited availability of such programs mean that many aspiring homeowners continue to rely on the \\"bank of mum and dad.\\" Conclusion The record-high reliance on the \\"bank of mum and dad\\" highlights the significant obstacles facing first-time homebuyers in today's competitive and expensive property market. While family assistance can be a valuable lifeline, it is essential to consider the broader implications of this trend, such as the potential impact on wealth inequality and financial sustainability. Efforts to reduce the reliance on the family assistance and create a fair and accessible property market should be ongoing. This can be achieved by implementing policies that address housing supply issues, encourage affordable housing development, and provide targeted support for those who struggle to save for a deposit or compete in the property market. By doing so, homeownership may become a more attainable goal for the many first-time buyers still striving to get on the property ladder."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Green Bay Packers fans will be able to watch Brett Favre ceremony at Lambeau Field Updated FEB 27, 2015 2:00p ET GREEN BAY, Wis. -- There has been somewhat of a compromise between Brett Favre and the Green Bay Packers Hall of Fame for his upcoming ceremony. While Favre's induction will still take place on July 18 in the atrium in front of 1,600 sponsors, the Packers have decided to open the Lambeau Field bowl area for fans who want to attend. Favre spoke with Greta Van Susteren on FOX News in early February and expressed his desire to not have his ceremony in front of a smaller gathering at the atrium area of Lambeau Field. Because sponsors claimed every ticket, they were never made available to the public. \\"I would like to see, in my opinion, I would like to see us do it in the stadium,\\" Favre told Van Susteren. \\"I think everyone should have a chance to go.\\" \\"I think everyone should have an option to go,\\" Favre added. \\"What a better way to do it than at Lambeau Field. . . . There's nothing like Lambeau Field. And even though the atrium is right there, it would be nice to do it in the stadium.\\" Now, they can. Sort of. For 4, fans can sit in the seats of Lambeau Field and watch the ceremony on the TundraVision video boards. Favre will address those in attendance later that evening, after he's concluded the actual ceremony. \\"This viewing opportunity from the stadium will be a unique complement to a special evening and allow more people to share their excitement with Brett,\\" Packers president/CEO Mark Murphy said in a statement. The induction ceremony will also now be available to watch live on television and the team's website. The ceremony will consist of Favre's No. 4 jersey being retired by the Packers and him joining the Packers Hall of Fame.

Normally, only traces of protein are found in urine, and when higher amounts are found, damage to the glomeruli is the likely basis. Unusually large quantities of urine may point to diseases like diabetes mellitus or hypothalamic tumors that cause diabetes insipidus. The color of urine is determined mostly by the breakdown products of red blood cell destruction (Figure 25.2). The “heme” of hemoglobin is converted by the liver into water-soluble forms that can be excreted into the bile and indirectly into the urine. This yellow pigment is urochrome. Urine color may also be affected by certain foods like beets, berries, and fava beans. A kidney stone or a cancer of the urinary system may produce sufficient bleeding to manifest as pink or even bright red urine. Diseases of the liver or obstructions of bile drainage from the liver impart a dark “tea” or “cola” hue to the urine. Dehydration produces darker, concentrated urine that may also possess the slight odor of ammonia. Most of the ammonia produced from protein breakdown is converted into urea by the liver, so ammonia is rarely detected in fresh urine. The strong ammonia odor you may detect in bathrooms or alleys is due to the breakdown of urea into ammonia by bacteria in the environment. About one in five people detect a distinctive odor in their urine after consuming asparagus; other foods such as onions, garlic, and fish can impart their own aromas! These food-caused odors are harmless.   Q: Normally, only traces of protein are found in urine, and when higher amounts are found, damage to what is the likely cause?   A: Answer:","output":"When higher amounts of protein are found in urine, the likely cause of this finding is damage to the glomeruli. The glomeruli are a crucial part of the nephrons in the kidneys, responsible for filtering blood to remove waste products and excess substances while retaining important elements, such as proteins, to be reabsorbed by the body. When the glomeruli are damaged, they can become less effective at selectively filtering the blood, which allows more protein to pass through into the urine. This increase in protein levels in the urine can be indicative of renal disease or an underlying issue within the kidneys."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Article:","output":"Title: Smartphone Giant BlackBerry Acquired by Its Biggest Shareholder Amidst Significant Losses and Workforce Cuts Introduction: In an unexpected turn of events, smartphone giant BlackBerry is being bought by its largest shareholder at 9 per share. This announcement comes on the heels of BlackBerry reporting nearly 1 billion in losses and plans to cut 40% of its workforce to mitigate costs. Body: Recently, BlackBerry has faced significant challenges in the highly competitive smartphone market. The iconic brand has struggled to maintain its market share amidst fierce competition from Apple, Samsung, and a myriad of other players in the industry. In an effort to revitalize its position and bolster its financial standing, the company is now being acquired by its biggest shareholder. The 9-a-piece payout reflects the current market evaluation of BlackBerry's shares. While share prices have been struggling over the past few years, this acquisition deal signifies the buyer's confidence in the potential for BlackBerry's rebound under new ownership.  The recent news of BlackBerry's losses, nearing an astounding 1 billion, was a major red flag for industry analysts and investors alike. Recognizing the severity of the situation, management announced a sweeping plan to cut costs by reducing their workforce by 40%. This significant reduction is expected to streamline the company's operations and refocus its efforts on a smaller, more targeted product line. The acquisition by the largest shareholder reinforces the belief that BlackBerry can weather this storm and eventually emerge stronger. The new owner's financial support, coupled with the aggressive cost-cutting measures, is expected to provide sufficient resources for the company to innovate and revamp its product lineup to better compete in today's rapidly evolving smartphone market. Conclusion: In summary, BlackBerry's acquisition by its biggest shareholder, following the announcement of near-1 billion losses and severe workforce reductions, represents a pivotal moment for the company. This change of ownership, alongside its cost-cutting measures, is anticipated to breathe new life into the struggling brand. As BlackBerry embarks on this new chapter, it remains to be seen whether these actions will be enough to secure the company's future in the ever-competitive smartphone industry."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Summarize this article in one sentence. You should never go to class on an empty stomach. Hunger pangs can easily distract you from the curriculum. Always have something to eat before a class. In a morning class especially, make sure to get up in time for breakfast. If you don't have time for a big meal, grab something small. A piece of toast or a bowl of yogurt can really help you focus during class. Prior to class, make a list of reasons you sometimes have trouble concentrating. This can include things like checking your phone, a noisy classroom, and a tendency to daydream. Then, write down ways you can combat these problems.  For example, you can write down something like, \\"I can't resist the temptation to check my phone when I hear it buzz in my pocket.\\" Think of a way to eliminate this distraction. For example, \\"I should turn my phone off before class.\\" Unless a laptop is required for class, leave yours behind. You'll be able to focus more when you take notes by hand as you're less likely to be distracted by a lingering internet browser.  Install a program on your computer to block out your favorite social media sites during the specific times you’re in class or open a new window so you aren’t distracted. It's okay to bring your phone, as you may need it for directions immediately after class. However, be sure to power it down before class begins. Exercise can help you focus. If you have time, get a workout in before class in the morning. If you don't have time for a full workout, some light exercise can help. Go for a short walk before class or do some light cardio in your apartment. If you typically drive to class, try walking or biking instead.

Write an article based on this summary: Spray the stink bugs you see with a soap, water, and lavender oil solution. Use a neem oil spray to prevent stink bugs from laying new eggs. Sprinkle diatomaceous earth (DE) around your property to kill bugs when they try to enter.","output":"Title: Sustainable Stink Bug Control: A Natural Approach to Save Your Garden Introduction Gardeners and homeowners alike dread the invasion of stink bugs. These pesky insects not only emit a foul smell when disturbed, but also cause major damage to fruits, vegetables, and ornamental plants. With their growing populations and resistance to traditional pesticides, it is crucial that we find natural and eco-friendly ways to tackle these bothersome pests. In this article, we highlight three non-toxic methods to manage stink bugs: using a soap, water, and lavender oil solution to kill them; applying neem oil to deter them from laying eggs; and sprinkling diatomaceous earth to eliminate any remaining stragglers. 1. Soap, Water, and Lavender Oil Solution: A Potent Spray for Stink Bugs The first line of defense against stink bugs is a simple homemade solution consisting of soap, water, and lavender oil. Not only is this spray effective at eliminating stink bugs, but it is also safe for the environment, pets, and humans.  To create this bug-fighting spray, fill a spray bottle with one part dish soap, fifteen parts water, and a few drops of lavender essential oil. Shake well to combine all the ingredients. When you spot stink bugs on your plants or around your home, simply spritz them generously with this mixture. The soap suffocates the bugs by creating a layer over their respiratory systems, while lavender oil repels other stink bugs with its strong scent. By using this solution regularly, you can significantly reduce the number of stink bugs residing in your garden or home. 2. Neem Oil: A Natural Insecticide to Deter Egg Laying Neem oil is a powerful, organic insecticide derived from the seeds of the neem tree. With its ability to disrupt the reproductive cycle of insects, it can effectively discourage stink bugs from laying eggs on your plants. Additionally, neem oil is safe for beneficial insects like bees and butterflies, so you can maintain a balanced garden ecosystem. To make a neem oil spray, mix two tablespoons of neem oil, one tablespoon of mild liquid soap, and one gallon of water in a large container. Fill a spray bottle with this mixture, and apply it to your plants, paying particular attention to the undersides of leaves where stink bugs are likely to lay eggs. Neem oil has a strong odor, which dissipates quickly, but can still be an effective deterrent. Regular applications of neem oil every one to two weeks can significantly decrease the number of new stink bugs invading your garden. 3. Diatomaceous Earth: A Deadly Barrier Against Stink Bug Invaders Sprinkling diatomaceous earth (DE) around your property is another effective method to eliminate stink bugs. Diatomaceous earth is made from the fossilized remains of diatoms, a type of hard-shelled algae. This abrasive powder is highly effective at killing insects by damaging their exoskeletons and causing dehydration.  To use diatomaceous earth, simply sprinkle it around the perimeter of your garden, around windows, doors, and any other entry points for stink bugs. Make sure to use food-grade DE, which is safe for humans, pets, and plants. When stink bugs come into contact with the DE, their exoskeletons will be damaged, and they will eventually die of dehydration. This method provides a long-lasting barrier against stink bugs, as long as the DE remains dry. Reapply after heavy rain or if you notice an increase in stink bug activity. Conclusion By employing these three natural methods, gardeners and homeowners can effectively combat stink bug infestations without resorting to chemical pesticides. These solutions not only protect your plants, but also maintain the ecological balance in your garden by preserving beneficial insects. In the fight against these invasive pests, eco-friendly options such as a soap, water, and lavender oil solution, neem oil, and diatomaceous earth help create a sustainable approach to garden management. With consistent use and diligent observation, you can enjoy a stink bug-free environment while protecting the environment and the creatures that share it with you."},{"instruction":"Question: What is the final step of the following process: -  Water seeps into rocks - The water freezes and thaws - Cracks form in the rocks - Cracks also form when rocks heat up Answer:","output":"The final step of this process is weathering and breaking down of rocks into smaller fragments, which may eventually form new sediments or contribute to soil formation."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"Yes, the perturbation of more sediment being deposited on the same spot will have a direct effect on the process of sedimentary rock formation. As more sediment accumulates on the spot, it will lead to increased pressure and compaction on the underlying layers of sediment. This increased pressure and compaction will, in turn, facilitate the formation of more sedimentary rock over time. Additionally, the continuous deposition of sediment may lead to the development of thicker layers of sedimentary rock or result in the formation of different types of sedimentary rocks, depending on the composition of the deposited sediment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Please answer the following question: LOS ANGELES/WASHINGTON — As U.S. political candidates make their final appeals, voters in 35 states will decide policy issues Tuesday that include legalizing recreational use of marijuana and restricting access to guns and ammunition, voting yes or no on nearly 160 state ballot initiatives. California's Proposition 64, which is leading in the polls, could create a multibillion-dollar marijuana industry by legalizing the recreational use the drug for adults in the state. Similar measures are on the ballot in Arizona, Nevada, Maine and Massachusetts. Marijuana could be legalized for medical use in Florida and three other states. Medical marijuana is already permitted in half the 50 U.S. states, and recreational use is allowed in Alaska, Colorado, Washington state, Oregon and the District of Columbia. Marijuana is banned under federal law, but U.S. officials have taken a hands-off approach on the issue. Voters in Maine and Nevada are considering measures that would expand background checks for gun purchases, which is already required for buying guns from dealers, by extending the provision to private sales. Californians will consider measures requiring background checks for buyers of ammunition and banning high-capacity ammunition magazines. Washington state has a measure that would allow the courts to bar the sale of guns to individuals deemed an extreme risk to themselves or others. Californians are considering whether to eliminate the death penalty with Proposition 62, or to maintain capital punishment and make the process more efficient with Proposition 66, which supporters say makes it more fair to victims of violent crimes. Twenty states and the District of Columbia have abolished or overturned capital punishment on the grounds that it is unequally applied to minority populations and that innocent people are sometimes convicted. South Dakotans will decide whether to make statewide offices nonpartisan and create a citizens commission to redraw voting districts after each 10-year national census, removing...

While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Instructions: In this task, you are given a sentence and your task is to identify whether the sentence contains motion or not, by classifying the sentence into Yes or No. The sentence belongs to the 'Yes' category if there is an occurrence of a motion of a physical entity otherwise the sentence belongs to the 'No' category. The sentence contains motion if it (i) involves the movement of a physical object. (ii) contains verb in present tense indicating the action performed. Sometimes there can be verb which indicates a motion but the motion might have happened in the past and the answers to such sentences is 'No' Input: When he opened the door it seemed to his fancy that the wax tapers burned but dimly amid the shadows of the great room, and that the pictured faces hanging on the walls looked white and gazed as if aghast. Output:","output":"Yes Step 1: Read the sentence and identify the presence of physical objects and verbs. In the sentence, we have physical objects such as door, wax tapers, great room, and pictured faces on the walls. We also have verbs like \\"opened\\", \\"seemed\\", \\"burned\\", and \\"gazed\\". Step 2: Analyze the verbs to see if they indicate motion in the present tense. \\"Opened\\" indicates motion (opening door) in the past tense, \\"seemed\\" is not associated with motion, \\"burned\\" is in the past tense and not indicating motion, and \\"gazed\\" doesn't indicate motion either. Step 3: Determine if there is any verb that indicates motion in the present tense. There are no verbs in the sentence indicating motion in the present tense. However, the sentence describes the scene as it appears in the present, with dimly burning wax tapers and pictured faces gazing in a particular way. Step 4: Make a decision. The sentence involves the movement of a physical object (opening the door); however, the verb \\"opened\\" is in the past tense. Even though the motion happened in the past, it triggered the scene that is described as being perceived in the present moment. Therefore, the sentence is classified as \\"Yes\\" because it contains motion."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize the following: Many of the serious strains of bacterial infections can be prevented with immunizations. Seasonal flu shots and pneumococcal vaccines will likely help reduce ear infections.  You and every member of your family should also get a flu vaccination every year. Vaccinating yourself will help keep both you and your family safer from infection.  Experts recommend that you use the PCV13 pneumococcal conjugate vaccination for children. Ask your pediatrician for advice. Wash your child's hands, toys and play surfaces frequently to reduce the likelihood of infection. Pacifiers can be vectors for bacteria, including bacteria that causes ear infections. Leakage is more likely to occur in bottle-feeding than it is in breastfeeding, making the transmission of bacteria higher.  Breastfeeding also boosts your child’s immune system, helping him or her to fight off infections easier.  If bottle-feeding is necessary, place the child in an upright seat so that liquids drip down instead of possibly into their ear.  Never give a baby a bottle while s/he is going down for a nap or to sleep at night. Do this both for the sake of preventing ear infections and for general health and safety. Prolonged usage of antibiotics can leave certain bacteria in your body or your child's body resistant to the effects of certain drugs. Only use antibiotics when prescribed by your doctor, or when other options aren't available. These facilities put your child at a 50% greater chance of developing an ear infection due to the common transmission of infections both bacterial and viral.  If you cannot avoid sending your child to daycare, teach him or her a few tactics to help avoid the spread of infections such as colds, which can cause ear infections.  Teach your child not to put toys or fingers in his or her mouth. S/he should avoid touching the face with his or her hands, especially mucous membrane areas such as the mouth, eyes, and nose. S/he should wash hands after eating and after using the bathroom. Eating a wide variety of fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins helps your body stay strong and healthy. Some research also suggests that \\"good\\" bacteria such as probiotics may help protect your body from infection. Acidophilus is a commonly studied strain of probiotic. You can find it in many yogurts. Summary:","output":"Immunizations can help prevent serious bacterial infections, and seasonal flu shots and pneumococcal vaccines may reduce ear infections. Annual flu vaccinations are recommended for everyone in the family to promote overall health and safety. For children, the PCV13 pneumococcal conjugate vaccination is suggested, and frequent hand washing and cleaning of toys and surfaces can lower infection risks. Pacifiers and bottle-feeding may contribute to the spread of bacteria, so breastfeeding is encouraged for its immune-boosting benefits. When bottle-feeding, ensure the child is upright and avoid giving a bottle during naps or bedtime. Use antibiotics only when prescribed and necessary to avoid resistance. If daycare is unavoidable, teach children good hygiene practices to prevent the spread of infections. A healthy diet and intake of probiotics, such as acidophilus found in yogurt, can strengthen the immune system and protect against infections."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Personal money-management website Mint.com suggests recently that responsible parents should give their kids credit cards--possibly starting as young as middle school. The website says a credit card will help children master responsible spending habits and give parents the chance to teach them some valuable lessons. It's absolutely true that kids should learn about how a credit card works and how to use it responsibly. But the idea that they need a card of their own to practise this is questionable. Yes, credit cards are a teaching tool, but it's the time you spend educating them about money management that does the teaching, not the piece of plastic. Sit down with your child--here we are referring to teens and walk them through your credit card statements. Point out important things like the due date, late fee warning, and APR  . If you have good credit, adding a child as an authorized user onto one of your credit cards also provides teachable moments. Allow kids to use the card to make specific purchases and require their participation in payment. Since the card is still in your name, you can take them off it at any point and cut off their access if they're not able to handle the responsibility. Another option is to set them up with an account at a local bank that offers free use of a debit card  . Unlike credit card, the debit card has no overdraft   function. Children can only use the card to pay for things and the money is taken directly from their bank account. If the account is empty, the worst that will happen is the card being declined at a cash register. Options: A To avoid extremely high overdraft fees. B To encourage them to share household expenses. C To teach them to be responsible credit card users. D To help them pay close attention to their bank account. Answer: C To teach them to be responsible credit card users.

The flowers grew better in the pots than in the ground because there was fertilizer in the","output":"soil that the store had provided. Amy, an experienced gardener, noticed the difference and decided to take some action. Step 1: Analyze the situation Amy observed her garden and saw that the flowers in the pots were thriving, while the ones in the ground were struggling. She suspected that the fertilizer in the store-bought potting soil was making a significant difference. Step 2: Research Before making any changes, Amy decided to research the fertilizer used in the potting soil. She visited the store where she had bought her supplies and learned that the soil in the pots had a mix of essential nutrients, specifically designed to support flower growth. She took note of the ingredients to look for a suitable alternative for her other plants. Step 3: Create a plan With her new knowledge, Amy decided to create a plan to improve the growth of the flowers in the ground. She would apply a similar fertilizer mix to the earth, while also taking care of other factors like water, sunlight, and positioning. She sketched out a plan and set goals for each task, committing to follow it for the next few weeks. Step 4: Prepare and apply fertilizer Amy went shopping for an appropriate fertilizer that matched the mix she learned about earlier. Once she found the right product, she prepared the ground by loosening the soil around the flowers and mixed the fertilizer with earth as per the product's instructions. She made sure not to over-apply, as too much fertilizer can be harmful to the plants. Step 5: Monitor progress and adjust the approach Over the following weeks, Amy monitored the progress of her flowers, paying close attention to their growth and overall health. She took note of any changes and made adjustments to her care routine as needed, such as watering more or less, depending on the weather conditions and specific needs of each plant species. Step 6: Share knowledge Seeing the positive results in her garden, she decided to share her knowledge with other gardening enthusiasts in her community. She posted before-and-after pictures of her flowers on social media, along with a detailed explanation of the steps she took to achieve these results. Her friends and neighbors appreciated her tips and started implementing some of these practices in their own gardens. As a result, the community gardens flourished, filling the neighborhood with color and beauty. By following these steps, Amy was able to bridge the gap between the growth of the potted flowers and those planted in the ground. The process not only improved the overall appearance of her garden but also allowed her to help others in her community to create vibrant, healthy gardens as well."},{"instruction":"If I tell you that If food is not immediately used for energy then that food will be converted into fat, and ask you the question \\"if food is not immediately used for energy then that food will be converted into what\\", is the correct answer \\"glucose\\"?

Q:Process: - Human industry produces chemical compounds - Chemical compounds rise into the air - Chemical compounds mix with elements in clouds - The affected rain falls to the earth - The affected rain can harm natural and man-made objects because of its acidic content.  Question: suppose the climate changes dramatically happens, how will it affect less affected rain to fall.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","output":"The climate change could have an effect on the rate at which less affected rain falls. To determine whether this effect will be more, less, or have no effect on the phenomenon, we will consider the following steps: Step 1: Analyze the reasons for dramatic climate change Dramatic climate change could be due to factors like increased greenhouse gas emissions, deforestation, and other human activities. These factors can have various impacts on weather patterns, temperature, and precipitation. Step 2: Examine the link between climate change and rain patterns The altered climate can cause changes in the formation of clouds, the frequency of rain, and the intensity of rainfall events. These changes can lead to either an increase or decrease of precipitation in different regions, affecting the rate at which less affected rain falls. Step 3: Calculate the implications of climate change on chemical compounds The release of chemical compounds into the air due to human industry might also be affected by climate change. Changes in temperature, air currents, and other atmospheric factors may alter the distribution of these pollutants and their reactions within clouds. Step 4: Evaluate the impact of climate change on the second effect The second effect mentioned is the harm caused to natural and man-made objects due to the acidic content of the affected rain. If climate change leads to a situation where less affected rain falls more frequently, the overall harm to objects should decrease. However, if climate change results in less frequent, less affected rain, the damages caused by the remaining acidic rain might be more concentrated. Conclusion: In this case, it is challenging to conclusively state if the effect of the supposed perturbation on the less affected rain will be more, less, or have no effect on the overall harm caused by the affected rain to natural and man-made objects. The overall impact will depend on the specific changes in climate patterns and how they directly influence regional precipitation and chemical compounds distribution."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

George Frederic Watts was born in 1817, the son of a London musical instrument manufacturer. His two brothers died in 1823, and his mother in 1826, giving Watts an obsession with death throughout his life. Watts was apprenticed as a sculptor at the age of 10, and by his mid-teens was proficient enough as an artist to be earning a living as a portrait painter. At the age of 18 he gained admission to the Royal Academy schools, although he disliked their methods and his attendance was intermittent. From 1837, Watts was successful enough to devote himself full-time to painting.In 1843 Watts travelled to Italy where he remained for four years. On his return to London he suffered from melancholia, and painted many notably gloomy works. His skills were widely celebrated, and in 1856 he decided to devote himself to portrait painting. His portraits were extremely highly regarded, and in 1867 he was elected to the Royal Academy, at the time the highest honour available to an artist, although he rapidly became disillusioned with its culture. From 1870 onwards he became widely renowned as a painter of allegorical and mythical subjects; by this time, he was one of the most highly regarded artists in the world.

Question: Question: \\"In what year did Espartero's rule end?\\"  Context: \\"During the regency of Maria Cristina, Espartero ruled Spain for two years as its 18th Prime Minister from 16 September 1840 to 21 May 1841. Under his progressive government the old regime was tenuously reconciled to his liberal policies. During this period of upheaval in the provinces he declared that all the estates of the Church, its congregations, and its religious orders were national property—though in Valencia, most of this property was subsequently acquired by the local bourgeoisie. City life in Valencia carried on in a revolutionary climate, with frequent clashes between liberals and republicans, and the constant threat of reprisals by the Carlist troops of General Cabrera.\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"Baldomero Espartero, a prominent figure in Spanish history, took the reins of power as the 18th Prime Minister during a turbulent time in the country's past. Born on October 27, 1793, in Granátula de Calatrava, Spain, Espartero emerged as a skilled military leader who played a key role in the Carlist Wars, which spanned from 1833 to 1839. His military prowess elevated him to political prominence, culminating in his appointment as the regent during the minority of Queen Isabella II. Espartero's rule commenced on September 16, 1840, following the regency of Maria Cristina, the queen mother. His tenure as Prime Minister saw the efforts to reconcile the conservative factions with the progressive forces in Spain, as divisions had arisen between the liberals and republicans. Amid this tumultuous backdrop, Espartero enacted several bold policies, one of which involved the declaration of Church estates, congregations, and religious orders as national property. This move had significant ramifications, particularly in Valencia, where most of the Church's property was eventually acquired by the region's bourgeoisie. As Spain continued to experience unrest and social upheaval, Espartero's time in power ultimately came to an end on May 21, 1841. His two-year rule saw a number of both progressive and reconciliatory measures being implemented in order to mitigate the tension that had become pervasive throughout the nation. Despite these measures, conflicts persisted among the various factions, both before and after Espartero's term, contributing to the instability of the Spanish political landscape during that period. In conclusion, Espartero's rule as the 18th Prime Minister of Spain ended on May 21, 1841, after nearly two years in office. His tenure was characterized by efforts to quell the mounting discord between different groups within the country, while at the same time enacting policies that promoted progressive change. Although Espartero's rule was ultimately short-lived, his impact on the nation—particularly in the area of Church property—would endure for years to come."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: Read the bio below and try to give details on charlotte link 's:    - residence     - birth name       - birth date     - name     - birth place     - occupation     Bio: charlotte link -lrb- born 5 october 1963 in frankfurt am main -rrb- is a german writer . she is among the most successful contemporary authors writing in german .

Which of these examples involving heat transfer occurs mainly by conduction? - OPT: (I). The sun warms the ground.; (II). A hot oven warms a cold kitchen.; (III). A campfire warms a person's hands.; (IV). Hot soup warms a metal spoon handle.;","output":"Among the four examples provided, the one that mainly involves heat transfer by conduction is: (IV). Hot soup warms a metal spoon handle. To better understand why this is the case, let's first take a brief look at the three primary modes of heat transfer and then analyze each example. 1. Conduction: This is the process of heat transfer through a solid material, with molecules transferring energy to neighboring molecules via direct contact. Materials with high thermal conductivity, such as metals, transfer heat more readily than materials with low thermal conductivity, such as wood or plastic. 2. Convection: This process involves the transfer of heat by the movement of a fluid, such as air or water, with warmer fluid rising and cooler fluid sinking. Convection can occur due to natural processes (such as warm air rising) or forced processes (such as a fan blowing air). 3. Radiation: This is the transfer of heat via electromagnetic waves, such as infrared, without the need for any physical medium to carry the energy. All objects emit some amount of thermal radiation, with the intensity increasing with the object's temperature. Now, let's analyze each example: (I). The sun warms the ground: This mainly involves heat transfer by radiation. The sun emits heat in the form of electromagnetic waves, which travel through the vacuum of space and are absorbed by the earth's surface, warming it up. (II). A hot oven warms a cold kitchen: This involves a combination of conduction, convection, and radiation. The walls of the oven are heated by conduction from the heating element. The oven then emits heat through radiation, warming the surrounding area. Additionally, the air around the oven is heated, and natural convection currents are created as warm air rises and cooler air sinks, distributing heat throughout the kitchen. (III). A campfire warms a person's hands: This primarily involves heat transfer by radiation and convection. The flames emit heat in the form of infrared radiation, which is absorbed by the person's hands and other nearby objects. Moreover, the air around the fire is heated, and natural convection currents help distribute the heat to the surroundings, including the person's hands. (IV). Hot soup warms a metal spoon handle: In this example, the main mode of heat transfer is conduction. When the metal spoon is placed in the hot soup, the molecules at the base of the spoon gain energy from the soup and begin to vibrate more rapidly. This energy is then transferred along the length of the handle through the spoon's metal structure via conduction, ultimately warming the handle."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: For years, Aimee Lind, a librarian at the Getty Research Institute, has been struggling with ways to make architecture archives more accessible to users. To help solve this problem, she co-founded the California Architecture Archives Network (or CalArchNet) with her Cal Poly SLO colleague Jessica Holada. Together they have organized a series of one-day mini-conferences designed to foster dialogue and collaboration among librarians, archivists, and curators at California institutions that house architecture archives. The goal of these semiannual meetings is to create a space for convergence among professionals who intersect with architectural archives in different ways. Architecture archives, often containing large drawings and scale models, present unique problems due to their size and fragility. CalArchNet participants are interested in improving the overall user experience for visitors to the archives by looking for solutions to obstacles to access. This space for an informal exchange of ideas provides an opportunity to be transparent about the challenges repositories face when managing and processing architecture holdings, as well as encourages investigation and experimentation into ways new technologies may help to solve accessibility issues, such as improved interaction with digitized collections via the IIIF protocol or 3D-scanned facsimile models and virtual walk-throughs. October 27 marked the third meeting of CalArchNet, held at the Palm Springs Art Museum, Architecture and Design Center, with representatives from 13 institutions in attendance. Topics discussed included historic site preservation research methodology, leveraging statewide resources to enhance discovery of collections, security considerations, GIS mapping technologies, and the use of linked open data to make connections between collections. The day concluded with a curator-led tour of the exhibition Albert Frey and Lina Bo Bardi: A Search for Living Architecture. If you’re an archivist, librarian, or curator working with architecture...

Embedded Systems: Which Freescale Kinetis MCU is a good drop-in replacement for an LPC4330? Multi-choice problem: Would you say that these questions are the same? Select from the following. [+] no; [+] yes;","output":"Golang, also known as Go, is a programming language developed by Google with a focus on simplicity, safety, and performance. It is designed to handle and manage concurrent processing efficiently. Although Go is excellent for writing back-end services, web applications, and API servers, it is not traditionally known for its use in embedded systems. In the world of embedded systems, programming languages such as C and C++ are the most commonly used due to their efficiency, reliability, and toolchain support. These languages are widely favored in embedded systems since they offer low-level hardware control crucial for optimizing battery life, memory usage, and processing time for resource-constrained devices.  However, Golang can still be used in certain embedded systems under specific conditions. In 2020, support for Go on the TinyGo compiler was announced by Google, allowing developers to use Golang on microcontrollers and other limited-capacity hardware. This step has opened up new possibilities for Golang in the world of embedded systems, especially on microcontrollers and IoT devices.  Still, even though Golang has shown promise in expanding its presence in the embedded systems domain, it's important to recognize that the support and ecosystem are relatively limited compared to the established C and C++ languages. Depending on your project constraints and requirements, it's essential to weigh the language options carefully and choose the one that best fits your needs. As for the second question, if you are looking for a good drop-in replacement for the LPC4330 microcontroller (MCU) from NXP, you might want to consider the various alternatives within the Freescale (now a part of NXP) Kinetis MCU family. The LPC4330 is a dual-core MCU with an ARM Cortex-M4 processor paired with an ARM Cortex-M0 coprocessor. Identifying an exact drop-in replacement will depend on your specific use case and requirements from an MCU. It's essential to examine aspects such as processing speed, memory size, peripheral set, power consumption, and package size. One possible alternative is the Kinetis K6x series or Kinetis KV5x series of MCUs, both featuring ARM Cortex-M4 cores. These microcontrollers are designed to offer similar performance levels and feature sets, like the LPC4330, including high-speed USB On-The-Go (OTG), advanced PWM modules, and multiple GPIOs (general-purpose input/output pins). You may want to compare their specifications and chipsets to determine which one is the best match based on your needs. In conclusion, the two questions discussed are not the same. The first question evaluates if Golang is a suitable programming language for embedded systems, while the second question asks for a drop-in replacement for the LPC4330 MCU within the Freescale Kinetis family. Therefore, the correct choice of response is [+] no."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

Movie title: Friday the 13th Part VIII: Jason Takes Manhattan Movie plot: Following the events of The New Blood, two graduating high school students are aboard on a houseboat. Jim tells his girlfriend Suzy the legend of Jason Voorhees, before playing a prank on her with a hockey mask and a fake knife. The boat sails over some underwater cables, which electrocute Jason's corpse and cause his resurrection. He sneaks on board and kills Jim with a harpoon gun before impaling Suzy, who tries to hide from him, with a barb. The next morning, the SS Lazarus is ready to set sail for New York City with a graduating senior class from Lakeview High School and chaperoned by biology teacher Charles McCulloch and English teacher Colleen Van Deusen. Van Deusen brings McCulloch's niece Rennie along for the trip despite her aquaphobia much to his chagrin. Jason sneaks on board and kills rock star wannabe J.J. with her guitar before hiding in the bowels of the ship. That night, after a boxing match, a young boxer who lost to champion Julius Gaw is killed when Jason slams a hot sauna rock into his abdomen while Rennie, searching for her pet Border Collie Toby, discovers prom queen Tamara and Eva doing drugs. McCulloch nearly catches them moments later and Tamara pushes Rennie overboard, suspecting she told on them. She then uses video student Wayne to record McCulloch in a compromising situation with her, but rejects Wayne's advances afterward. Tamara is killed by Jason with a shard of broken mirror when she goes to take a shower. Rennie begins seeing visions of a young Jason throughout the ship, but the others ignore the deckhand's warnings that Jason is aboard. Jason kills Captain Robertson and his first mate. Rennie's boyfriend, Sean, discovers them and tells the others before calling for an emergency stop. Eva is strangled as she tries to flee from Jason. The students agree to search for Jason while McCulloch decides that the deckhand is responsible; however, the deckhand is discovered with an axe in his back. One of the students, Miles, is killed by Jason and Julius is knocked overboard....

Please write a short summary for the following article: State pension board votes on Trotsky’s pay The board of the Massachusetts state pension fund voted Tuesday to give executive director Michael Trotsky a 65,000 raise, to 360,000 a year, which will make him one of the dozen highest-paid officials in the state, including his bonus. Trotsky has the potential to earn a 40 percent annual bonus, as he did this year, which could push his total pay to 504,000 in 2015. Salaries of the staff at Pension Reserves Investment Management, which oversees the 60.2 billion retirement fund for state and local workers, do not come out of the state budget. But the vote came amid a broader discussion in Massachusetts about pay for public servants. Outgoing Treasurer Steve Grossman was in the minority Tuesday as one of two “no” votes on Trotsky’s pay raise, while the seven other board members approved the increase. One of the representatives of Governor Deval Patrick also voted no, citing challenging budgetary times in the Commonwealth. Grossman, in his final meeting as chairman of the pension board, praised Trotsky’s “outstanding performance” in his four years managing the fund but said the pay raise should be implemented over a longer period. Taxpayers have a lot at stake in the fund. It’s a prudent investment to pay the people who manage your money. “This is not an appropriate time for compensation to be increased by that magnitude,” Grossman said. Government pay raises should come in the context of “the challenges that all the people of Massachusetts are going through,’’ he said. Grossman said he would say the same for the pay raises recommended this week by an advisory commission, which said the governor’s salary should be bumped up to 185,000 from 151,800 and the attorney general’s to 175,000 from 130,582. The treasurer’s pay also would rise. Board member Robert Brousseau said Trotsky deserved the added pay and has not received a merit increase or asked for a raise since taking the job in August 2010. Two years ago, Trotsky took on the duties of a second job with the fund, chief investment officer, for 50,000 more than he was making at the time. At 295,000, he is making less for two jobs than his predecessor, Michael Travaglini, did for one job. Travaglini’s base pay, excluding bonus, was 322,000. Fund officials said Trotsky has saved the plan 300,000 a year by doing both jobs. “I’m gratified by the confidence the board has shown in me and our entire team,” Trotsky said in a statement. “I look forward to working with the PRIM team to continue to grow and strengthen the [pension] fund through continued outstanding performance, in order to further reduce taxpayers’ pension obligations.” Trotsky said Tuesday the pension fund earned a 9.4 percent return for the 12 months ended Oct. 31, beating the 7.1 percent return of a benchmark of hypothetical funds. For the calendar year through October, the state fund has gained 6.9 percent, slightly more than a Vanguard Group fund that holds 60 percent stocks and 40 percent bonds, which was up 6.5 percent. The best-performing parts of the fund this year have been long-term Treasury bonds — a sound bet made early this year that has delivered a 33 percent return. Private equity investments also have surged, climbing 24.7 percent. Trotsky took the top job at the fund after the financial crisis, when it had shed 24 percent of its value. In the succeeding four years, he has focused on taking risk out of the portfolio and cutting fees. Producing an average annual return exceeding 13 percent, he has beaten the Harvard University endowment every year. Treasurer-elect Deb Goldberg, who was not at the pension board meeting Tuesday, in a statement applauded Trotsky’s performance but opposed his raise. “When appropriate, it is critical that any compensation increases be implemented prudently and incrementally,” she said in the statement. Citing the threat of cuts for towns and cities, she said, “public servants need to also tighten their belts. In that context, a significant raise, albeit well-deserved, is uncomfortable and not necessarily appropriate at this time.” The list of highest-paid state employees in 2013 was dominated by UMass employees, with the top salary of 816,602 for Michael Collins, chancellor of the UMass Medical School and senior vice president of health services.

Article: Northern Europeans spend a lot of time in their cold and cloudy winters planning their summer holidays. They are proud of their healthy color when they return home after the holiday. But they also know that a certain amount of sunshine is good for their bodies and general health. In ancient Greece people knew about the healing  powers of the sun, but this knowledge was lost. At the end of the nineteenth century a Danish doctor, Niels Finsen, began to study the effect of sunlight on certain diseases, especially diseases of the skin. He was interested not only in natural sunlight but also in artificially   produced rays. Sunlight began to play a more important part in curing sick people. A Swiss doctor, Auguste Rollier, made full use of the sun in his hospital at Lysine. Lysine is a small village high up in the Alps. The position is important: the rays of the sun with the greatest healing power are the infra-red   and ultra-violet   rays; but ultra-violet rays are too easily lost in fog and the polluted air near industrial towns. Dr. Roller found that sunlight, fresh air and good food cure a great many diseases. He was particularly successful in curing certain forms of tuberculosis with his \\"sun-cure\\". There were a large number of children in Dr. Roller's hospital. He decided to start a school where sick children could be cured and at the same time continue to learn. It was not long before his school was full. In winter, wearing only shorts, socks and boots, the children put on their skis after breakfast and left the hospital. They carried small desks and chairs as well as their school books. Their teacher led them over the snow until they reached a slope which faced the sun and was free from cold winds. There they set out their desks and chairs, and school began. Although they wore hardly any clothes, Roller's pupils were very seldom cold. That was because their bodies were full of energy which they got from the sun. But the doctor knew that sunshine can also be dangerous. If, for example, tuberculosis is...

Write an article based on this summary: So what does the UK political upheaval mean for Brexit negotiations, slated to start in 10 days' time? Article:","output":"Title: UK Political Upheaval - Implications for Upcoming Brexit Negotiations Introduction The political landscape in the United Kingdom has experienced drastic changes in the past few weeks, with significant implications for the upcoming Brexit negotiations, set to begin in 10 days' time. As the country faces various challenges, including the COVID-19 pandemic, keeping the Brexit negotiations on track is essential to maintaining the international credibility of the United Kingdom. In this article, we will delve into the recent political upheavals and analyze their potential impact on Brexit negotiations. A Brief Overview of Recent UK Political Events The last few weeks have witnessed the resignation of various government officials within the UK, including critical figures in charge of handling the Brexit negotiations. These resignations were primarily due to internal political disagreements on the approach towards Brexit, which has fueled the current political chaos. As if the internal strife was not enough, external pressures in the form of disagreements with the European Union (EU) have added to the challenges the UK government currently faces. This combination of internal and external factors forms the backdrop for the impending Brexit negotiations. Impact of Political Instability on Brexit Negotiations 1. Weakened Negotiating Position The departure of key negotiators may weaken the UK's position in the Brexit negotiations. When experienced officials who are experts in their field leave their positions, they leave behind a potential vacuum. Filling this void may take time, and as a result, the UK may find itself in a less than ideal position to effectively negotiate with the EU. 2. Delayed Timeline for Negotiations The onset of resignations and political instability may also lead to a delay in the negotiations process. With a tight timeframe to work within, any delay may have far-reaching impacts on both the UK and EU as they seek to form agreements on key issues, including trade, immigration, and security. 3. Uncertainty Over The UK's Stance on Key Issues Political upheaval often leads to uncertainty in a nation's stance on particular issues. Such uncertainty may arise if key negotiators, who have championed a specific standpoint or policy, are no longer present to guide the discussions. This could make it difficult for the UK to effectively communicate and negotiate their intentions with the EU during the Brexit process. 4. Strained Relationship with EU For effective negotiations to take place, both parties need to trust one another and maintain a respectful discourse. However, the UK's political turmoil may have introduced an element of distrust and uncertainty on the part of the EU. This could potentially further complicate the negotiations if the EU perceives the UK as an unreliable negotiating partner. Final Thoughts The recent political upheaval in the United Kingdom comes at a critical time, with the nation poised to negotiate its future relationship with the European Union. As the political landscape continues to shift, the uncertainty surrounding Brexit negotiations will only increase. It is crucial for the UK government and its European counterparts to ensure that effective and amicable negotiations occur. They must overcome the current political chaos and its consequences in order to secure a resilient and prosperous future for both parties. In a rapidly changing global context, preserving the international credibility of the United Kingdom stands as a pressing priority."},{"instruction":"What type of details about elaine carbines  can be gathered from the following bio?

Chrismansyah Rahadi ([xrisˈmanʃah raˈhadi]; 16 September 1949 – 30 March 2007), born Christian Rahadi but better known by his stage name of Chrisye ([xəˈriʃə]), was an Indonesian progressive pop singer and songwriter. In his 40-year career he won many awards and accolades; in 2011 Rolling Stone Indonesia declared him the third-greatest Indonesian musician of all time. Born in Jakarta of mixed Chinese-Indonesian descent, Chrisye became interested in music at an early age. At high school he played bass guitar in a band he formed with his brother, Joris. In the late 1960s he joined Sabda Nada (later Gipsy), a band led by his neighbours, the Nasutions. In 1973, after a short hiatus, he rejoined the band to play in New York for a year. He briefly returned to Indonesia and then went back to New York with another band, the Pro's. After once again returning to Indonesia, he collaborated with Gipsy and Guruh Sukarnoputra to record the 1976 indie album Guruh Gipsy. Following the success of Guruh Gipsy, in 1977 Chrisye recorded two of his most critically acclaimed works: \\"Lilin-Lilin Kecil\\" by James F. Sundah, which eventually became his signature song, and the soundtrack album Badai Pasti Berlalu. Their success landed him a recording contract with Musica Studios, with whom he released his first solo album, Sabda Alam, in 1978. Over his almost 25-year career with Musica he recorded a further eighteen albums, and in 1980 acted in a film, Seindah Rembulan. Chrisye died in his Jakarta home on 30 March 2007 after a long battle with lung cancer. Known for his stiff stage persona and smooth vocals, Chrisye was critically acclaimed in Indonesia. Five albums to which he contributed were included in Rolling Stone Indonesia's list of the 150 Best Indonesian Albums of All Time; another four of his songs (and a fifth to which he contributed) were classified as some of the best Indonesian songs of all time in a later issue of the same magazine.

(2). yes.","output":"(1). no. The two sentences provided do not mean the same thing because they contradict each other regarding which year was the wettest and which was the driest.  In the first sentence, it is stated that the year 1965 was the wettest year since 1948, and 1956 was the driest year. This indicates that there was more rainfall in 1965 compared to any other year after 1948, while 1956 had the least rainfall. On the other hand, in the second sentence, it is stated that the year 1965 was the driest year since 1948, and 1956 was the wettest. This sentence is implying the opposite of what the first sentence was implying; it indicates that there was less rainfall in 1965 compared to any other year after 1948, while in 1956 there was the most rainfall.  The contradiction between which year had more rainfall (wettest) and which one had less (driest) in the two sentences is the reason they do not mean the same. This could be caused by an error in either sentence, but without additional information or context, it is impossible to discern which statement is correct. Conclusively, based on the comparison of both statements, we are forced to conclude that the sentences do not align and therefore, the provided sentences are not expressing the same idea or facts."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

History of science The basis for classical economics forms Adam Smith's An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations, published in 1776. Smith criticized mercantilism, advocating a system of free trade with division of labour. He postulated an \\"invisible hand\\" that regulated economic systems made up of actors guided only by self-interest. Karl Marx developed an alternative economic theory, called Marxian economics. Marxian economics is based on the labor theory of value and assumes the value of good to be based on the amount of labor required to produce it. Under this assumption, capitalism was based on employers not paying the full value of workers labor to create profit. The Austrian school responded to Marxian economics by viewing entrepreneurship as driving force of economic development. This replaced the labor theory of value by a system of supply and demand. Q: Who wrote An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations?","output":"An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations was written by Adam Smith, a Scottish economist and philosopher. The book, published in 1776, laid the foundations for classical economics and is considered one of the most important works in the history of economic thought. Smith introduced key concepts such as the division of labor, free trade, and the \\"invisible hand\\" that regulates economic systems, which have significantly influenced modern economics and policymaking."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The decision follows reports in the US and South Korea of the phone \\"exploding\\" during or after charging. The South Korean company said customers who had already bought the phone would be able to swap it for a new one. Samsung said it had been difficult to work out which phones were affected among the 2.5 million Note 7s sold. \\"There was a tiny problem in the manufacturing process, so it was very difficult to figure out,'' the president of Samsung's mobile business Koh Dong-jin told reporters. \\"It will cost us so much it makes my heart ache. Nevertheless, the reason we made this decision is because what is most important is customer safety,\\" he said. The firm said it would take about two weeks to prepare replacement devices. According to Samsung, the phone has been launched in 10 countries so far but with different companies supplying the batteries. The recall comes just one week ahead of an expected presentation of a new iPhone model from its main rival Apple. What makes lithium batteries catch fire? This is an extraordinary decision for a tech giant to make based on so few reported incidents - Samsung says it is aware of only 35 cases worldwide. It's bad timing so soon after a big product launch and especially given that Samsung's rival Apple is understood to be preparing to unveil a new iPhone. However, the firm says it has discovered a problem with the battery cell and is halting sales while it inspects its suppliers. People who have already bought the device - which is only available to pre-order in the UK - will be issued with a replacement. Stories about exploding smartphone batteries do make the news from time to time - lithium ion batteries are flammable but very widely used. Over the past few days, several users have reported their phones catching fire or exploding while charging, and Samsung said it had confirmed 35 such cases. A YouTube user uploaded a video under the name Ariel Gonzalez on 29 August of a Galaxy Note 7 with burnt rubber casing and damaged screen. He said the handset \\"caught fire\\" shortly after he unplugged the official Samsung charger, less than a fortnight after purchasing it. Further images of a burnt Galaxy Note 7 were uploaded to Kakao Story, a popular social media site in Korea, on 30 August. A user wrote: \\"There was another explosion of the Galaxy Note 7. It was my friend's phone. A Samsung employee checked the site and he is currently in talks over the compensation with Samsung. You should use its original charger just in case and leave the phone far away from where you are while charging.\\" The phone was only launched on 19 August and has since then been generally well-received by critics and consumers. The Galaxy Note 7 model is the latest of Samsung's series of so called phablets - smartphones with very large screens. Samsung also added an iris scanner to the Note 7, which lets users unlock the phone by detecting patterns in the eyes. In July, Samsung beat expectations with record earnings in the latest quarter with strong smartphone sales helping the firm post its best quarterly results in more than two years.

More than 62,000 incidents, including torture and rape, have been filed to the commission since 2013. Tunisia became a democracy after President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali was ousted in 2011. The commission is investigating reports of police torture, corruption and murder over a 50-year-period since independence. Alleged abusers include Tunisia's previous state authorities and top security bosses. A quarter of alleged victims are women who have complained about sexual violence, formerly a taboo in Tunisia. The mother of a protester shot by security forces in 2011, Ourida Kadoussi, began the televised testimonies. \\"They killed our children. We have not been given our rights,\\" she said asking for freedom and dignity. The president of the Truth and Dignity Commission, Sihem Ben Sedrine, opened the forum saying: \\"Tunisia will not accept human rights abuses after today. This is the message from Tunisia.\\" London-based human rights charity Amnesty International has welcomed the hearings, saying victims \\"may finally have a chance to have their right to truth fulfilled\\". But the charity also said it is uncertain whether justice will be done. \\"The real test facing Tunisia's transitional justice process, however, is whether it will ultimately lead to criminal prosecutions for the crimes of the past decades.\\" Tunisians seek justice for past wrongs The BBC's Rana Jawad in Tunis says victims of abuse have each been given up to one hour to tell their stories to a panel of commissioners, and an audience including representatives of civic groups and international observers. The commission hopes that victims will forgive their alleged abusers. But many victims who have spoken to the BBC have demanded financial compensation and say the accused should be held accountable in court. The Truth and Dignity Commission says alleged abusers might also have a chance to give public testimonies in the near future. Two additional TV hearings are scheduled in December and January. Tunisia's uprising was the first of the 2011 Arab Spring, and often hailed as the most successful with the country now functioning as a parliamentary democracy. But across the country many struggle to find work amid a high unemployment rate.

The country is due to host an investment conference at the end of November.

Meanwhile, he _ that China will stay committed to a peaceful development path and does not accept the logic that a country will seek hegemony(,) once it gets strong. \\"No one and nothing -- in any reason -- can influence China's determination and will to pursue the path of peaceful development,\\" he said. In his speech, the president also explained in detail about the development of friendly relations between China and Britain, citing tea culture, literature, movies, TV dramas, football and cultural exchanges. He specifically referred to Shakespeare's influence on him by sharing the story of his youth time in the countryside, when he was deeply attracted by the master's works. \\"The China-Britain friendship has been deeply rooted in the hearts of our two peoples.

He wasn't worried about the drought at all. The other bunnies, though, looked at the purple-red nettles withering in the fields and the mayweed that hadn't even flowered and wondered if they were going to have enough food to get them through the next winter. The very well-off bunny was named Albertus, but everybody called him Big Al--at least they called him that when they were sure he couldn't hear them. Big Al was in fact a very large bunny with long, white, silky fur. He had lots of land that his parents had left to him, and he never let any of the other bunnies gather food there. The story was that Big Al had sat on the one bunny who tried to make off with some of his carrots until the small bunny begged for mercy. After Big Al let him up, the small bunny moved to another village. One morning a dozen or more bunnies sat around the village square, licking the dew off the dried and wrinkled clover to quench their thirsts, and talking about the drought. There was still a bit of a cool breeze from Possum Creek, a mile or so away. Sophie Bunny, who was large and sleek, with a black circle around one eye, was there with her husband Lenny and their youngest, Ralph, who still lived at home with them. \\"I don't mind telling you,\\" Lenny said, \\"I'm getting a little scared by all this.\\" Lenny was a small, tan bunny with buck teeth and big cheeks like a chipmunk. \\"No need to be afraid,\\" said the short, overweight Reverend Billy Bunny, the village's spiritual leader. \\"The Easter Bunny will provide.\\" He sat, as he usually did, by the thick green hawthorn bush in the middle of the square--although the bush was neither as thick nor as green as it had once been.

What is the answer?","output":"The name of the Queen Mother's unfortunate 1957 Grand National horse, which includes the name of an English county, is Devon Loch. Devon Loch was a racehorse owned by Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother. The English county in its name is Devon, a county in southwestern England, known for its beautiful landscapes, coastlines, and historic landmarks. In the 1957 Grand National, a prestigious horse race held annually at Aintree Racecourse near Liverpool, England, Devon Loch was the favorite to win under jockey Dick Francis. The race seemed to be going in his favor as Devon Loch was leading until the final moments. In a surprising and bizarre turn of events, just 50 yards from the finish line, Devon Loch suddenly and inexplicably leaped into the air and landed in a belly flop, allowing the second horse, E.S.B., to overtake him and win the race. The reason for Devon Loch's peculiar behavior remains a mystery to this day. Some speculated that the horse was spooked by a shadow from a nearby fence or was disoriented by the noise from the cheering crowd. Others suggested that it may have been experiencing a cramp or a sudden physical issue. Dick Francis, the jockey, believed that Devon Loch might have mistakenly identified a patch of water as an obstacle and attempted to jump over it. Despite the unfortunate event, Devon Loch's performance at the 1957 Grand National became an iconic moment in the history of horse racing, still frequently recalled and discussed. The phrase \\"Doing a Devon Loch\\" even entered the British lexicon as an idiom to describe a situation in which someone inexplicably snatches defeat from the jaws of victory at the last possible moment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

How to make lemon ricotta cookies  Preheat the oven to 375 ° f (190 ° c) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.  Whisk together the flour, baking powder and kosher salt in a medium bowl.  Set the bowl aside.","output":"Step 1: Prepare the wet ingredients In a large bowl, cream together the softened butter and granulated sugar. You can do this using an electric mixer or with a whisk until the mixture becomes light and fluffy. This will take about 3 to 5 minutes. This step is important because it helps create a tender texture in the cookies by incorporating air into the batter. Step 2: Beat in the eggs, ricotta cheese, lemon zest, and lemon juice Add the eggs one at a time to the butter and sugar mixture, beating well after each addition. Make sure to scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed. Then, mix in the ricotta cheese, followed by the lemon zest and lemon juice. It's crucial to mix these ingredients until just combined, so you don't end up with a tough or rubbery texture. Step 3: Combine the dry and wet ingredients Gradually add the flour mixture from the medium bowl to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in a dense cookie texture. Instead, fold the ingredients together with a spatula until you have a smooth, homogeneous dough. Step 4: Scoop and shape the dough Using a cookie scoop or two spoons, scoop small balls of dough onto the parchment-lined baking sheet. Leave about 2 inches of space between each ball of dough to allow for spreading while baking. Step 5: Bake the cookies Place the baking sheet into the preheated oven at 375°F (190°C) and bake for 12 to 15 minutes, or until the edges of the cookies are lightly golden brown. Rotate the baking sheet halfway through the baking time to ensure even baking. Step 6: Cool the cookies Remove the cookies from the oven and let them cool on the baking sheet for about 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely. Step 7: Prepare the glaze (optional) While the cookies are cooling, you can prepare a simple lemon glaze by whisking together powdered sugar, lemon juice, and lemon zest until you achieve a smooth glaze.

Workplace diversity has become a business management concept in which employers actively seek to promote an inclusive workplace. By valuing diversity, employers have the capacity to create an environment in which there is a culture of respect for individual differences as well as the ability to draw in talent and ideas from all segments of the population.

She noticed that the egg moved faster on the countertop than on the rug. On which surface was more heat generated? (A) countertop (B) rug  Do not use A and B to answer the question but instead, choose between \\"marble countertop\\" and  \\"knitted rug\\". A:","output":"The marble countertop generated more heat than the knitted rug when Elizabeth rolled the egg on them. This observation can be explained by analyzing the differences in the properties and interactions of the two surfaces with the egg. First, let's consider the friction involved. Friction is the force that resists the relative motion or tendency of such motion between two surfaces in contact. It occurs as a result of the irregularities and interlocking between the microscopic contact points of the interacting surfaces. The amount of friction generated between the surfaces depends on the type of materials in contact and their respective surface roughness. In this scenario, the marble countertop is a smooth and hard surface with low roughness, which allows the egg to roll with less resistance. On the other hand, the knitted rug is a soft and textured surface with a higher degree of roughness, causing the egg to experience more resistance while rolling. When an object moves across a surface with friction, some of the kinetic energy from the motion is converted to thermal energy or heat due to the work done against the frictional force. As a result, the surface with higher friction will produce more heat. Since the egg encounters lower friction on the marble countertop than on the knitted rug, it can roll faster on the former. However, despite the difference in rolling speed, the marble countertop still generates more heat than the rug due to its higher thermal conductivity. Thermal conductivity is the property of a material to conduct heat. Marble, being a type of stone, has relatively high thermal conductivity compared to the fibers used in a knitted rug. As the egg rolls over the marble countertop, it experiences a quicker transfer of thermal energy, or heat, from the contact points on the countertop than on the rug. The insulating nature of the rug's fibers is not conducive to rapid heat transfer, hence less heat generation during the rolling process. In conclusion, the marble countertop generates more heat than the knitted rug when the egg rolls on them, due to the combination of frictional forces and the differences in thermal conductivity between the two surfaces."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Tim Kaine greets crowd in Spanish as Clinton introduces VP pick in Miami Tim Kaine, Hillary Clinton’s newly minted running mate, had barely taken his place at the podium in Miami when he started speaking Spanish. Related: Who is Tim Kaine? Clinton's 'smart political pick' for VP a bipartisan favorite “Bienvenidos a todos en nuestro pais, porque somos Americanos todos,” the senator from Virginia said. It translated to: “Welcome to everyone in our country, because we are all Americans.” Of Clinton, he said: “We’re going to be compañeros de alma [soulmates] in this great lucha [fight] ahead.” A crowd of thousands had queued for hours under the sweltering sun, lines snaking around the campus of Florida International University. They erupted into cheers. Not long after, Kaine asked those who were naturalized US citizens to raise their hands. A sizable chunk of the audience obliged in a county that is home to a majority Hispanic population. “Thank you for choosing us,” Kaine said, to another rousing reception. Such moments captured dramatically a tale of two elections: Clinton and Kaine embracing the changing demographics of America, Donald Trump surging to the Republican nomination on a staunch anti-immigration platform and a pledge to build a wall on the US-Mexico border. In Miami, one voter, Michael Paul Massaria, turned to his wife and remarked: “We’re not hearing all that doom and gloom like we did at the Republican convention in Cleveland.” On multiple occasions, Kaine was interrupted with chants of “USA! USA!” – the sort of patriotism often on display at Republican events where time is dedicated to the projection of American strength. But the supporters who packed into this basketball stadium were celebrating a different vision, one in which America is defined by its diversity and multiculturalism. Bienvenidos a todos en nuestro pais, porque somos Americanos todos “We’ve got this beautiful country that should be a country of welcome, a country of inclusion,” Kaine said. He later vowed to advance comprehensive immigration reform with a pathway to citizenship for the roughly 11 million undocumented immigrants living in the US, in the first 100 days of a Clinton presidency. Such promises could be seen as wishful thinking, as Barack Obama has learned during his time in the White House. But Massaria, from nearby Davie, was quick to observe the benefit. Kaine’s fluency in Spanish, he said, “will help down the line with bringing in the Latino vote, especially here in south Florida”. Attendees like Anna Alvarez, a 67-year-old naturalized citizen who moved to Miami 43 years ago, were a testament to the potential appeal of a vice-presidential candidate campaigning for the first time in English and Spanish. “He will get in his pocket the millions and millions of Hispanics that Trump lost,” she said. Alvarez had never seen Kaine before, a fact the senator invoked with the self-deprecating declaration: “Let me be honest: for many of you this is the first time you’ve heard my name.” Alvarez said: “I’m one of the ones that didn’t know his name, but he was incredible. He’s down to earth, I liked his background and his experience. I really like the way he was very proud of his wife.” Trump, she said, reminded her of the Cuban regime she fled from more than four decades ago. “I had the experience of [Fidel] Castro,” she said, “and Trump is a reminder of the dictators in the world. I am totally against anything that has to do with Trump.” Clinton, who sat beaming behind Kaine throughout his remarks, said in her introduction that America was united behind the “the confidence, the optimism that we are stronger together”. “I’m so thrilled to announce that my running mate doesn’t just share those values, he lives them,” she said. “Tim Kaine is everything Donald Trump and [his vice-presidentil pick] Mike Pence are not. He’s qualified to step into this job and lead on day one. And he is a progressive who likes to get things done.” Clinton announced late on Friday that she had picked Kaine, a senator from Virginia, following an extensive vetting process that lasted more than two months. Her choice followed a calculation that the working-class, swing-state senator could bolster her appeal not just among Latinos but also moderates and independents. A faction of progressives are less enthusiastic about Kaine’s centrist record, particularly his approach to the regulation of Wall Street and his support for the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal. Clinton’s former rival, the Vermont senator Bernie Sanders, did not immediately respond to the news. Clinton will formally accept the Democratic nomination for president this week, at the party’s national convention in Philadelphia. When I say he’s a progressive who likes to get things done, I mean it. He’s not afraid to take on special interests In Miami, Clinton touted Kaine as a “pragmatic progressive”. “When I say he’s a progressive who likes to get things done, I mean it. He’s not afraid to take on special interests,” Clinton said, adding that Kaine “cares more about making a difference than making headlines”. “And make no mistake. Behind that smile Tim also has a backbone of steel. Just ask the NRA.” Kaine was governor during the 2007 Virginia Tech shooting, in which 32 students and faculty members were killed. The senator made reference to the tragedy on Saturday, pausing for a moment as he grew emotional. “It was the worst day of my life,” he said. Kaine recounted how he battled the National Rifle Association in his push for stricter gun laws, which eventually led to an executive order to bar firearm sales to individuals legally declared mentally ill or dangerous. Gun control has emerged as a prominent issue in the 2016 election. Kaine pledged: “We will not rest until we get universal background checks.” It was one of his biggest applause lines. Kaine also wasted little time going after Trump, invoking the real estate mogul’s recent comments that the US should not immediately come to the assistance of Nato allies unless they had fulfilled their obligations in return. “This drives home the stakes of this election,” Kaine said, noting that his son was a US Marine who would deploy next week to Europe “to uphold America’s commitment to our Nato allies”. He added: “Hillary Clinton is the direct opposite of Donald Trump. She doesn’t trash our allies – she respects them.” Trump last week chose Pence, the Indiana governor, as his vice-presidential candidate. A popular figure among evangelical conservatives and known, like Kaine, for his polite demeanor, Pence has nonetheless shed the nice-guy image in his new role as attack dog for Trump, echoing the real estate mogul’s message that Clinton is corrupt and disqualified from the presidency. Trump sought to brand Kaine as beholden to special interests, tweeting early on Saturday that Clinton had in effect rejected the will of progressives and Sanders backers. “Tim Kaine is, and always has been, owned by the banks,” he said. “Bernie supporters are outraged, was their last choice. Bernie fought for nothing!” Later, Trump added: “Just saw Crooked Hillary and Tim Kaine together. Isis and our other enemies are drooling. They don’t look presidential to me!” Related: Hillary Clinton's choice of Tim Kaine shows she's the real grown-up in this contest | Richard Wolffe Kaine appeared undeterred, though, in his second campaign appearance with Clinton in just two weeks. Earlier this month, he joined her on the stump in his home state. It was after that rally, aides said, that Clinton moved closer to settling on Kaine. She did not, however, reach a final decision until Friday evening. After placing calls to other top contenders for the job, Clinton called Kaine, who was at an event at a Massachusetts shipyard. He was greeted by top officials from the campaign and later received a congratulatory call from Obama, who nearly chose Kaine as his running mate in 2008. Kaine, who showed off a confident but freewheeling style on the stump, did not practice his speech, an aide said. In concluding his remarks, Kaine appealed once more against the divisive rhetoric of his opponents. “America is not built on fear,” he said, quoting President Harry Truman. “America is built on courage, on imagination and on an unbeatable determination to do the job at hand. “Tough times don’t last, but tough people do. And they don’t come tougher than Hillary Clinton.” Summary:","output":"Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's running mate, Tim Kaine, spoke in Spanish while addressing the crowd at their joint event in Miami, enthusiastically embracing multiculturalism and the changing demographics in America. In contrast, Republican candidate Donald Trump has been pushing an anti-immigration platform and pledging to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. Supporters view Kaine's fluency in Spanish as a way to pull in the Latino vote, especially in the southern states."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Swap out heavy moisturizers for lighter options that will keep you shine-free once spring rolls around. FIX: We hope you've been exfoliating throughout the winter months, but don't stop once the end of March rolls around! To keep your skin in tip-top shape, exfoliate at least once a week to get rid of unwanted dead skin cells. You'll help keep your pores clean while also brightening your skin FIX: It seems obvious (and it is) that the summer months aren’t the only time you should be applying sunscreen. Since your skin has basically been in hibernation, it’s imperative that you protect it from both UVA and UVB rays with a broad-spectrum sunscreen. MISTAKE: Not Cleaning Your Makeup Brushes FIX: Most of us have fallen victim to skipping this important step. Not only do unclean brushes cause breakouts, but they can inhibit makeup application, too. So the next time you’re test-driving the perfect smoky eye, wash your brushes in a gentle shampoo or cleanser before grabbing your eye shadow. FIX: Yes, it’s getting warmer! But before you layer on the bronzer, consider using a CC cream to brighten skin and provide a more natural look at the start of the season. If you’re desperately in need of allover color, try a tanning serum to allow for more even application without the risk of sun damage. FIX: The plums and deeper tones that are perfect for winter are not ideal for spring -- and this includes the hues on your nails! Go bold with neons and bright colors, and keep your makeup sweet and light. FIX: Don't forget to stock up on products that will keep your hair healthy this spring. Tame frizz and flyaways with a frizz-vanishing cream! MISTAKE: Jumping in the Water With Dry Hair FIX: Whether you're enjoying a warm spring day or your spring break vacation (lucky you!), take care of those luscious locks. When you soak your hair with water and conditioner before entering the pool or the ocean, it significantly reduces the damage that the harsh chlorine and salt can do to your hair. We could not be more excited for spring! With winter finally behind us, it's time to start working on our summer glow while enjoying more and more time outside. But before breaking out the flip-flops and culottes, you might want to rethink your current beauty routine. There are a handful of classic spring beauty mistakes we all make and can easily avoid with a few simple tricks.","output":"This article outlines eight common spring beauty mistakes and provides solutions for each.

The Brooks family, which had amassed a fortune in the shipping insurance business and had been investing in Chicago real estate since 1863, had retained Chicago property manager Owen F. Aldis to manage the construction of the seven-story Grannis Block on Dearborn Street in 1880. It was Aldis, one of two men Louis Sullivan credited with being \\"responsible for the modern office building\\", who convinced investors such as the Brooks brothers to build new skyscrapers in Chicago. By the end of the century, Aldis would create over 1,000,000 square feet (93,000 m2) of new office space and manage nearly one fifth of the office space in the Loop.Daniel Burnham and John Wellborn Root met as young draftsmen in the Chicago firm of Carter, Drake, and Wight in 1872 and left to form Burnham & Root the following year.

When I popped into this place to meet Miss Jenny L, I initially thought she'd totally dropped the ball! GG is not the most polished looking of places and I'd go as far to say it looks a little shabby, a little cheap and a tad on the garish side.  But that's all so minor when it come to everything else. Service wise it's spot on. Friendly, swift and non intrusive (the holy trinity!). However, it's the food where this place really hits the 4/5 stars. With a modest menu consisting of breakfasts (all day I thunk), burgers and sandwiches, it's easy to navigate and promotes the feeling that they don't do a lot, but what the do, they do well.   This was most certainly the case with the 'Ultimate' breakfast which managed to defeat me (I know! I've let down my gender and my Glasgonian brethren). The 'Ultimate' hopped into my life with it's scrambled eggs, muffin, bacon, venison sausages (I'm gonna say yum, but in truth I've never really been a big venison fan), haggis (genuine yum) and salad (hahahahahahahahaha).

Glitz, gowns and government bigwigs will all be on display at Monday's parade of inaugural pomp and circumstance. President Barack Obama will be ceremonially sworn into his second term in office by Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts around midday. After the daytime events, which will include the inaugural address and parade, the president and first lady Michelle Obama will end their night by taking to the dance floor at two inaugural balls. While the formal events bring out their fair share of celebrities, media mavens, and the just-darn-lucky citizens who scored tickets online, there will be only one belle of the ball: The first lady. Lessons in style from Michelle Obama. Behold one of the most prized traditions of the inaugural season: the wait for the dress. The hype around the inaugural ball gown is the closest thing this side of the pond to a royal wedding gown, and it's approached with the same gusto. \\"There has always been an interest in what the first lady is wearing. Photographs and descriptions of the inaugural gown and who designed it have been news for decades,\\" said Lisa Kathleen Graddy, the curator of The Smithsonian's First Ladies Collection at the National Museum of American History. \\"Sometimes sketches and descriptions of the dress and even formal photographs of the incoming first lady wearing the dress were released in advance to newspapers,\\" she said. After all, it is typically the country's collective first impression of the first lady. Mr. President, who are you wearing? Monday evening, the president and first lady will attend the Commander in Chief's Ball, which honors service members and their families, a tradition started by former President George W. Bush; and at the Inaugural Ball, the president and first lady will celebrate with people around the country who bought tickets to attend. At the 2009 inaugural balls, Michelle Obama donned a white chiffon, one-shoulder dress created by Jason Wu, a then up-and-coming, 26-year-old Taiwanese-born designer. She didn't reveal who or what she would be wearing until she stepped out that night. Wu's name is now mentioned in the same breath as heavy-hitting designers like Oscar de la Renta, Carolina Hererra, Marc Jacobs and Diane Von Furstenberg. That now-iconic gown is part of \\"A First Lady's Debut,\\" a collection on display at The Smithsonian. Included in the display are the gowns worn by the 11 most recent first ladies, beginning with Mamie Eisenhower. The museum also houses The First Ladies Collection, which displays clothing worn by earlier White House residents. \\"When we look at the gown that Jackie Kennedy wore 50 years ago, or the one that Mary Todd Lincoln wore more than a hundred years before that, it really takes us beyond the history books and the photographs, and it helps us understand that history is really made by real live people,\\" said the current first lady at the unveiling of her gown in March 2010. She continued: \\"The detail of each gown -- the fabric, the cut, the color -- tells us something much more about each single first lady. It's a visual reminder that we each come from such different backgrounds, from different generations, and from different walks of life.\\" Graddy said Mamie Eisenhower, Jacqueline Kennedy and Nancy Reagan in particular captured the look and feel of their eras -- the early '50s, '60s and '80s, respectively. Mamie Eisenhower's iconic inaugural ball gown was designed by Jewish-American fashion designer Nettie Rosenstein, who championed ready-to-wear fashion and is credited by many with popularizing the \\"little black dress.\\" It was a sparkling pink creation, made with 2,000 rhinestones. \\"First Lady Pink\\" soon became a popular color choice for ladies of the decade. While Eisenhower was quintessential 1950s, Jacqueline Kennedy went signature '60s with a gown by Ethel Frankau of Bergdorf Custom Salon. Frankau, who based the gown on descriptions and consultations with Mrs. Kennedy, created a slim, straight silhouette. A chiffon overlay covered an encrusted, off-white strapless bodice (wearing strapless couture without some sort of covering was considered risquÃ© at the time). Meanwhile, Nancy Reagan's hand-beaded gown by American couturier James Galanos cost 22,500 and oozed the Hollywood glamour that she and her actor-turned-politician husband brought to the White House. It's a given that no matter how handsome President Obama might look in his tuxedo at the galas, all eyes will be on his companion. \\"The first lady is both an American celebrity and one of the most visible representatives of the nation. She's 'our' first lady and our pride and interest, and curiosity, extends to what she wears,\\" Graddy said. See the past 100 years' worth of inaugural outfits in the gallery above.

In Chile, they’ve apparently killed a dog.      The animal-welfare group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals posted a pair of photos on its PETA Latino blog showing a small, short-haired dog dashing across a street in Santiago, Chile, and then in the second photo lying motionless on the pavement, apparently hit by the Google car that PETA says took the photos.      In honor of the apparently deceased canine, PETA is asking Google to match its 1,000 donation to a Chilean spay-and-neuter group called the RIMA Foundation.      Google could not be reached for comment Friday afternoon. ||||| GOOGLE doesn’t let mountains or oceans get in the way of mapping the world and it seems it won’t stop at animals either.      Images from a street view car in Chile show what appears to be one of its camera-bearing cars running over a dog and leaving it for dead.      If you take a trip down Meza Bell 2815, Chile on Google Maps you can re-live the moment, shot-by-shot, when a little canine trots in front of the path of the oncoming car — the next images seen from the car’s rear-facing camera show it lying on the road not moving.      News.com.au followed the Google car’s path as it kept on driving and looking back as far as the zoom could stretch and did not see the pooch hop to its feet. Closer inspection of the more immediate images do show the dog moving in one image but it’s hard to tell whether this is a last struggle of life or whether he is just laying in the sun and having a stretch.      A person can be seen at the side of the road where the ‘accident’ occurred but they didn’t rush to the rescue — perhaps a sign that the dog was in no danger? Or perhaps it’s another local who is used to the many stray street dogs in the area and this is not an unusual occurrence.      This sort of thing also isn’t unusual for Google. In January last year it was accused of running over a donkey in Botswana after images on street view walking alongside the vehicle one moment then lying still on the ground the next. It was swiftly proven by Google that this wasn’t a hit-and-run and that the images were not as they appear.      Google has said it is investigating the images regarding the dog to “understand and inform what happened” and reassure they “have guidelines in place to protect people and animals” as they map places around the world.      To us, it looks like the dog has simply chosen a paw place to take a lie down.      What do you think? Did Google kill this dog?

Choose your answer from: i. yes. ii. no.","output":"i. Yes, the statement provided is a correct answer. During the reign of Henry II, suffering the king's ill-will indeed meant difficulties in obtaining grants, honours, or petitions. One of the most famous instances of Henry II expressing his fury and ill-will was towards Thomas Becket, who served as the Archbishop of Canterbury from 1162 until his death in 1170. The relationship between Henry II and Thomas Becket began amicably, with Becket serving as the chancellor to the king before ascending to the position of Archbishop of Canterbury. However, after Becket became Archbishop, their friendly relationship took a turn for the worse. The key issue that caused the rift between Becket and Henry was a disagreement over the rights and privileges of the Church. As king, Henry II sought to reassert royal authority over the power of the clergy and the Church. Becket, on the other hand, resisted Henry's attempts, believing that the Church should retain its independence from the state. Their disagreements escalated over several years, with Becket facing several trials and ultimately fleeing to France for some time. Eventually, Becket returned to England, but the tensions between him and the king persisted, climaxing in Henry's infamous expression of fury and ill-will. In an outburst, Henry exclaimed, \\"Will no one rid me of this turbulent priest?\\" (although the exact phrasing of this quote is debated). Four knights, interpreting Henry's statement as a direct order, travelled to Canterbury and murdered Thomas Becket in the cathedral on December 29, 1170. In conclusion, the provided statement is correct. King Henry II infamously expressed his fury and ill-will towards Thomas Becket, ultimately resulting in Becket's death by the hands of the king's knights in 1170. This incident exemplified the repercussions of suffering the king's ill-will during the Norman period."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Though she did not sign with Syco, Cowell's record label, she did record a duet of \\"Walking in the Air\\" with Johnston, which appeared on his debut album, One Voice, and was tipped as a potential Christmas number-one. Before the release of One Voice, it was revealed that Smith and her father were finalising the details of her record deal. In November, it was announced that Smith would be performing on stage in Kettering with Sylvia Berryman, a vocal tutor who had worked with Smith prior to her appearance on Britain's Got Talent. Smith said that she was \\"really looking forward to singing locally again\\", and it was again reported that Smith hoped to soon sign her own record deal.In December 2008 the Daily Mail reported that Smith had signed a £2.3 million, multi-album deal with Universal Music Group that was the \\"most lucrative recording contract ever handed to a schoolgirl\\". Smith said \\"I'm honoured to be joining such a fantastic record company, especially since it's where [Jenkins] started.\\" Dickon Stainer, speaking on behalf of Universal, said \\"as soon as we saw Faryl, it became an ambition to sign her.\\" Universal claimed it intended to market Smith as a pop star.

Question: Where was the rogue element located that EDI took upon itself to attack? Movie title: Stealth Movie plot: U.S. Navy pilots Ben Gannon (Josh Lucas), Henry Purcell (Jamie Foxx), and Kara Wade (Jessica Biel) are the best of the best. Captain George Cummings (Sam Shepard) chose them out of 400 pilots to fly the next generation of stealth fighter jets called Talons. After their flight training in the Talons, they have become a cohesive unit and a highly efficient fighting team. Captain Cummings adds a new \\"wingman\\" to the team, an Unmanned Combat Aerial Vehicle (UCAV) that is being flown by \\"EDI\\", a computer with an artificial intelligence brain mounted in a ball inside the cockpit. On their first mission, EDI begins to learn the skills and attitudes of the other pilots, and quickly understands that he can fly the plane better and faster than men. EDI has the capability to process data faster, and under extreme speeds will not blackout. Returning to the aircraft carrier, EDI is struck by lightning, which begins to change the computer's circuits. On the next flight, EDI refuses to scrub a mission despite the potential for massive civilian casualties. Upon return to base, Ben implores Captain Cummings to remove EDI from duty for further testing; Cummings ignores Ben's objections, and EDI's computer tech (who was beginning to suspect EDI was going rogue) is mysteriously replaced by much more docile techs. EDI begins to think for itself, and assigns itself a mission to take out a radical element in China. EDI cuts his link with the flight controller on the carrier, and he will not take a direct order from Ben. Henry locates and chases EDI, and gives it an ultimatum: return to base, or he will take it out. EDI declines to return to base. Henry fires his missiles, misses EDI, and is himself killed by the explosions. If you thought it was unbelievable up 'til now, it gets worse.

Select the farthest short wall in an oblong room.\\"","output":"Title: Mastering Interior Design: Creating the Perfect Focal Point in Any Room Introduction A carefully designed room has the ability to uplift your mood, enhance relaxation, and boost productivity, while a poorly designed space can have the opposite effect. One of the key aspects of interior design is the ability to identify and accentuate the room's focal point. A focal point is the visual center of attention in a room, typically a significant architectural element or a piece of furniture that captures the eye and anchors the overall design of the space. Finding the natural focal point in a room, or creating one when none exist, is essential in achieving a balanced and visually pleasing interior. This article will help you understand the importance of a focal point and guide you through the steps of creating the perfect focal point in any room. 1. Identify the Natural Focal Point Before diving into the realm of creating a focal point, assess the room and identify if it already has a natural focal point. Some rooms have a fireplace, large window, built-in bookshelf, or an architectural detail that automatically draws attention. If your room has a feature like this, think of ways to enhance and bring focus to that particular element. This can be achieved by arranging furniture around it, painting the wall a contrasting color, or adding eye-catching accessories. 2. Create a Focal Point in Rooms Without One Not every room has a natural focal point, but that doesn’t mean you can’t create one. Start by selecting a wall without windows or doors, as uninterrupted walls make an ideal surface for introducing a new visual anchor. Some effective ways to create a focal point in a room without one include: - Hanging a large piece of artwork or a statement mirror: A striking piece of art or a unique mirror can add depth and interest to the room. - Introducing a bold accent wall: Painting or adding wallpaper to a single wall can create a dramatic contrast and instantly become the center of attention. - Adding a significant piece of furniture: A large entertainment center, distinctive bookshelf, or grand piano can serve as a functional and attractive focal point. 3. Choose the Right Wall in an Oblong Room In an oblong or rectangular room, it's best to select the farthest short wall as the location for your focal point. Positioning the focal point on a shorter wall helps to balance the proportions of the room by drawing the eye to the other end, making the space feel less linear and more inviting. Consider creating a cozy seating area, a gallery wall, or an eye-catching storage solution on the shorter wall to leverage the space effectively. 4. Arrange Furniture and Accessories to Complement the Focal Point Once you've established the focal point in your room, you can begin to strategically place furniture and accessories to create a harmonious design. Arrange the seating and other furnishings in a way that draws attention to the focal point, allowing it to serve as an anchor for the room's layout. Use complementary colors and patterns to create cohesion and unity between the various design elements. 5. Don't Overload the Space While it's essential to create a captivating focal point, be mindful not to overwhelm the room with too many competing elements. The purpose of a focal point is to create a visual anchor and provide a sense of balance to the space. Overloading the room with multiple focal points or excessively bold design elements can result in visual chaos and disrupt the overall harmony of the interior. Conclusion Creating the perfect focal point in any room starts with understanding the natural focus of the space or creating one when none exist. Selecting the right wall, utilizing bold design elements, and strategically arranging furniture and accessories are key steps in achieving a balanced and visually pleasing interior. By following these guidelines, you can transform any room into a dynamic and cohesive space that leaves a lasting impression."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Answer: West's controversial incident the following year at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards was arguably his biggest controversy, and led to widespread outrage throughout the music industry.  Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion?","output":"No, the question was not answered in a detailed or extended manner. Here's a more comprehensive response: The biggest controversy involving Kanye West, an American rapper, songwriter, and fashion designer, undeniably took place at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards. This event transpired on September 13, 2009, and it's since come to be known as the 'Taylor Swift Incident.' On that night, teen country singer Taylor Swift won the Best Female Video award for her song \\"You Belong with Me,\\" beating out several seasoned artists. As Swift started delivering her acceptance speech, Kanye West took to the stage uninvited, grabbed the microphone from her, and said something that would reverberate through the halls of pop culture history for years to come: \\"Yo Taylor, I'm really happy for you, and I'mma let you finish, but Beyoncé had one of the best videos of all time.\\" West was referring to Beyoncé's music video for \\"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It),\\" which hadn't won the award. His interruption and public disrespect of Swift during her moment of recognition was disrespectful and deemed an extreme exemplification of poor sportsmanship. The reaction to Kanye West's outburst was instantaneous and largely negative. The live audience booed him, a clear sign of their disapproval of his actions. Immediately, various celebrities like Pink, Katy Perry, and even the then-president Barack Obama condemned his actions. On social media platforms, the backlash was severe, with many viewers and fellow musicians labeling his behavior as arrogant and rude. The incident caused a significant stall in his career and damage to his reputation from which it took substantial time to recover. Beyoncé, the artist West was defending, was visibly uncomfortable and surprised by the incident. Later on in the evening, when she won the Video of the Year award for the same song, she invited Swift back onto the stage to finish her speech, a gesture widely seen as gracious and humble in stark contrast to West's previous outburst. In the years following the incident, Kanye West has issued several public apologies to Taylor Swift. In an interview on The Jay Leno Show just days after the incident, a contrite West expressed his regret and said he would like to apologize to Swift in person. However, the controversy saw a resurgence in 2016 with the release of West's song \\"Famous,\\" which referenced the incident and further offended Swift. As a result, the controversy at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards is seen as the most significant in Kanye West's career, marking a remarkable turning point in the depiction of his public persona. The repercussions and constant revisitals of the incident continue to affect his image and public perception."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

On to the Twentieth Century: The British extended their control over the peninsula by putting together the whole panoply of colonial administration — civil service, public works, judiciary force, police force, post office, education, and land regulation — with teams of British administrators, teachers, engineers, and doctors to go with it. At the same time, the tin industry, dominated by Chinese using labor-intensive methods in the 19th century, passed increasingly into Western hands, who employed the modern technology of gravel pumps and mining dredges. Petroleum had been found in northern Borneo, at Miri, and in Brunei, and the Anglo-Dutch Shell company used Singapore as its regional depot for its oil supplies and exports. But the major breakthrough for the Malay economy was the triumph of rubber, when Singapore's new garden director, Henry Ridle (\\"Rubber Ridley\\" to his friends, \\"Mad Ridley\\" to all doubting Thomases) had developed new planting and tapping methods and painstakingly spread his faith in rubber around the peninsula. World demand increased with the growth of the motor-car and electrical industries, and sky-rocketed during World War I. By 1920, Malaya was producing 53 percent of the world's rubber, which had overtaken tin as its main source of income. The Malay ruling class again took a back seat. Together with effective control of the rubber and tin industries, the British now firmly held the reins of government. The sultans were left in charge of local and religious affairs, content with their prestige, prosperity, and security. The census of 1931 served as an alarm signal for the Malay national consciousness. Bolstered by a new influx of immigrants to meet the rubber and tin booms of the 1920s, non-Malays now slightly outnumbered the indigenous population. The Great Depression of 1929 stepped up ethnic competition in the shrinking job market, and nationalism developed to safeguard Malay interests against the Chinese and Indians rather than the British imperial authority. Though hampered by the peninsula's division into the States and the Straits Settlements, relatively conservative Muslim intellectuals and community leaders came together at the Pan-Malayan Malay Congress in Kuala Lumpur in 1939. In Singapore the following year, they were joined by representatives from Sarawak and Brunei. Teachers and journalists urged the revival of the common Malay-Indonesian consciousness, split by the Anglo-Dutch dismemberment of the region in the 19th century. This spirit became a factor in the gathering clouds of war.  Question: \\"What caused the Malay ruling class to take a back seat?\\" Answer: \\"The Chinese fomented a revolution\\" Is this answer to the question correct?","output":"No, this answer is not correct. The Malay ruling class took a back seat because the British extended their control over the peninsula and effectively took control of the rubber and tin industries. The British also held the reins of government, leaving the Malay ruling class in charge of only local and religious affairs."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Context: The southern state of Alabama is the center of the U.S. political universe this week as voters on Tuesday choose a senator to replace Jeff Sessions, who left the Senate to become attorney general. The race pits controversial Republican Roy Moore, who is battling sexual harassment allegations, against Democrat Doug Jones, a former prosecutor. The outcome of the race could have national implications for both political parties and for President Donald Trump. Moore has denied several allegations of sexual misconduct when he was in his 30s involving women who were teenagers at the time, including one who was 14. \\"I do not know them. I had no encounter with them. I never molested anyone,\\" Moore said in a televised interview Sunday with the Voice of Alabama Politics.  Jones says the accusations make Moore unfit to serve in the Senate. \\"It is crystal clear that these women are telling the truth and Roy Moore is not!\\" Jones said. Trump recorded a get-out-the-vote phone message for Moore and spoke on his behalf at a rally in neighboring Florida on Friday. \\"And we want jobs, jobs, jobs. So get out and vote for Roy Moore. Do it. Do it,\\" he said. Trump held off on endorsing Moore for several weeks in the wake of the sexual misconduct allegations, but now says electing Moore is a priority for him. \\"We certainly don't want to have a liberal Democrat who is controlled by Nancy Pelosi and controlled by Chuck Schumer. We don't want to have that for Alabama,\\" Trump said. In the final days of the campaign, Moore is highlighting his support for the president's agenda. \\"We are going to see if the people of Alabama will support the president and support his agenda in Washington by electing somebody that is not part of the establishment there,\\" Moore said.  Democrat Jones told supporters that Moore's character is the issue. \\"We know who we are, Alabama, we know who we are.

News article: Augusten Burroughs Makes a Dash for the Country Perfection comprised five fireplaces; well-worn wide-plank floors; 12-over-12 windows, most with the original panes; and a sunroom with grand views of the unruly water. There was lots of space for the couple’s three dogs to roam. Bookshelves were everywhere — they even run up the vertiginous back staircase. (The wise will grab hold of the pieces of antique plow harness that were repurposed as safety grips and affixed to the wall.) “The house was built with the expectation that you’re going to need to have a book no matter where you’re sitting at any given moment,” Mr. Burroughs said. “And here’s a place to put it.” Delightfully, everything is just a bit off plumb. This may include the house’s inhabitants, whose kitchen bookshelves bulge with unlikely titles such as “Rosemary’s Baby,” “Middlesex” and “Celebrity Detox.” Among the few cookbooks, Mr. Schelling said in an email, are “three ancient, falling-apart, slightly scary Southern ones that were Augusten’s grandmother’s, and a salmonella-stained hardcover set of ‘Mastering the Art of French Cooking.’ They’re in a cupboard with the dog treats. Of course.” What renovating the couple undertook was in the name of backdating rather than updating. Dismayed by a bathroom that a previous owner had modernized in the 1990s and that featured a fiberglass shower unit, Mr. Burroughs and Mr. Schelling recently redid it in 1930s style, with small handmade tiles and period-appropriate fixtures. The schoolhouse turned kitchen — it’s still got a bell on the roof — was determinedly left untouched. “There are old houses that have super-modern kitchens with granite counters, and that’s lovely, but it’s not what we wanted,” Mr. Burroughs said. “This house has been beautifully maintained and cared for, but it hasn’t been bastardized.” He and Mr. Schelling have made some effort to confine their furniture choices to antiques. The Eastlake bed in the master bedroom is from the late 19th century. An English table with barley-twist legs and a dresser with the initials “ES,” both from the early 18th century, sit in opposite corners of the living room. “I love old things, because I feel if something has survived a few hundred years of use, I’m probably not going to destroy it,” said Mr. Burroughs, who nonetheless didn’t think twice about grabbing a pair of capacious wing chairs, antique reproductions, for 75 each at a yard sale. “We’re not purists,” he said. “To be a purist requires a level of living skills that I don’t possess. And we didn’t want anything precious. Christopher and I aren’t fancy, and we have three dogs.” On the walls are paintings of animals, peculiar-looking children and their elders, as well as some family portraits by Mr. Burroughs’s mother, Margaret Robison. “While we had a broken relationship, I do love these works of art,” said Mr. Burroughs, who chronicled that broken relationship in “Running With Scissors,” an account of his wretched, highly dysfunctional childhood. In 2005, he and his publisher were sued for libel by the family that took him in when he was a teenager. The matter was settled for an undisclosed sum. Mr. Burroughs has made a career out of strip-mining his past. But he seems no less interested in considering the pasts of others, in pondering the previous lives that were lived in his home. “Certain places I stand in seem like the exactly perfect spot for standing,” he said, holding his ground in just such a spot in the living room. “And I wonder if other people have realized that same thing through the years. And if you lean in a certain way against the window in the master bedroom, there’s a perfect view of the full moon. I’m sure people have been leaning against that windowsill looking at the moon for hundreds of years.” He savors what was left behind when he and Mr. Schelling moved in. These treasures include the dresser in the master bedroom, “but also an odd assortment of things left in exactly the place you need them,” Mr. Burroughs said. “You’ll be swatting a fly in the changing room and you’ll find sticking out from the top shelf of the closet the handle of a fly swatter with a daisy on it.” Come summer, the couple may spruce up the guest cottage so Mr. Burroughs can go out there to work. For the moment, he happily floats around the house with his laptop, setting up shop on a table in the living room, on the tufted green-velvet sofa or on the built-in wood bench in the attic. “Maybe it’s because I grew up in the country, but I love it here,” he said. “As energizing and dynamic as the city is, I’m boring. I’m a writer.” What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"This news article talks about how Augusten Burroughs, a writer, moved to a beautiful old country house with his partner, Mr. Schelling.

The youngest son said that the tree was bowed  down with heavy fruits. It was full of life and fulfillment .

We are told that he's starving for us, and he's working tirelessly for us, and my heart just broke for him.","output":"To come up with the Yoruba translation of the given English sentence, I used the definition and my understanding of Yoruba language structure to translate the sentence word by word or by phrases. First, I identified the subject, verb, and objects within the sentence. The sentence has three parts: 1. He's starving for us 2. He's working tirelessly for us 3. My heart just broke for him. For each part, I found the appropriate Yoruba words or phrases that express the same meaning as the English words. 1. He's starving for us: The subject is \\"he\\", the verb is \\"starving\\", and the object is \\"us\\". In Yoruba, the word for \\"he\\" is \\"oun\\", \\"starving\\" can be translated to \\"ń jẹun sìní,\\" and \\"for us\\" to \\"fún wa\\". Putting it together, we have \\"Oun ń jẹun sìní fún wa\\". 2. He's working tirelessly for us: The subject remains \\"he\\". The verb is \\"working tirelessly,\\" which can be translated to \\"şìşẹ́ gbẹ̀rẹ̀\\" in Yoruba. By adding \\"for us\\" which is \\"fún wa\\", it becomes \\"Oun şìşẹ́ gbẹ̀rẹ̀ fún wa\\". 3. My heart just broke for him: In this part, the subject is \\"my heart\\". The Yoruba translation for \\"my heart\\" is \\"ọkàn mi\\". The verb is \\"broke\\", which can be translated to \\"darú\\" in Yoruba. Adding \\"for him\\", which is \\"fún un\\" in Yoruba, the whole phrase becomes \\"Ọkàn mi darú fún un\\". Finally, I joined the three translated parts together: Oun Starving fún wa, oun şìşẹ́ gbẹ̀rẹ̀ fún wa, ati ọkàn mi darú fún un."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Kevin Maurice Garnett (born May 19, 1976) is an American former professional basketball player who played for 21 seasons in the National Basketball Association (NBA). He played the power forward and center positions. In high school, Garnett was a 1995 McDonald's All-American at Farragut Career Academy and won a national player of the year award. He entered the 1995 NBA draft, where he was selected with the fifth overall pick by the Minnesota Timberwolves and became the first NBA player drafted directly out of high school in 20 years. On February 19, 2015, Garnett agreed to waive his no-trade clause in order to be traded back to Minnesota in exchange for Thaddeus Young. Six days later, he made his return for the Timberwolves against the Washington Wizards at the Target Center, recording five points on 2-of-7 shooting with eight rebounds and two blocks in 19 minutes in his first game for Minnesota since 2007. He appeared in just five games for the Timberwolves in 2014-15, before sitting out the team's final 21 games of the season due to a nagging knee injury.  On July 11, 2015, Garnett re-signed with the Timberwolves to a two-year deal. On November 15, 2015, Garnett became the fifth player in NBA history to play at least 50,000 minutes. He joined Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, Karl Malone, Jason Kidd and Elvin Hayes. Garnett played a season-high 23:54 against the Memphis Grizzlies, recording eight points, five rebounds and four assists. On November 23, he had a season-best game with 8 points and 10 rebounds in a 100-95 win over the Philadelphia 76ers. On December 1, he recorded four points and eight rebounds in 20 minutes against the Orlando Magic, surpassing Jason Kidd (50,110) for third on the NBA's career minutes list. Four days later, in a loss to the Portland Trail Blazers, he became the 15th player in NBA history to surpass 26,000 career points.  On December 11, 2015, Garnett passed Karl Malone as the NBA's all-time leader in defensive rebounds during Minnesota's 111-108 overtime loss to the Denver Nuggets. He finished the game with four defensive boards to give him 11,409 for his career, three ahead of Malone. Garnett appeared in 38 of the team's first 45 games of the season before missing the entire second half of the season with a right knee injury, the same knee that kept him out of 25 games in 2008-09 when he was playing for Boston, as well as much of his post-trade time in Minnesota during the 2014-15 season.  On September 23, 2016, Garnett announced his retirement after 21 seasons in the NBA. While Garnett did express interest in playing for one more season with the Timberwolves, primarily with the goal in helping the team make it to the playoffs again with its promising young players and new head coach, he also told the team's owner that he wasn't sure that his knees would hold up for one more season.

A UK regulator had recommended the inspection after a fire broke out on a 787 Dreamliner jet parked at Heathrow airport earlier this month. It was traced to the upper rear part of the plane where the part - Emergency Locator Transmitter (ELT) - is fitted. Boeing said it had asked operators of 717, Next-Generation 737, 747-400, 767 and 777 planes to inspect aircraft. \\"We're taking this action following the UK Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) Special Bulletin, which recommended that airplane models with fixed Honeywell ELTs be inspected,\\" Randy Tinseth, vice president marketing for Boeing Commercial Airplanes, said in a blog post. \\"The purpose of these inspections is to gather data to support potential rulemaking by regulators.\\" As a result of the fire on the parked Ethiopian Airlines plane, London's Heathrow airport was closed for 90 minutes. After the fire, the regulator had asked all Boeing 787s switch off an electrical component until further notice and suggested a safety review of similar components in other aircraft. In a statement, the AAIB had said that the component needed more \\"airworthiness action\\". It had said that \\"it was not clear whether the combustion in the area of the ELT was initiated by a release of energy within the batteries or by an external mechanism such as an electrical short\\". It added that as the the ceiling space where the ELT is located does \\"not typically carry the means of fire detection... had this event occurred in flight it could pose a significant safety concern and raise challenges for the cabin crew in tackling the resulting fire\\". Honeywell International, the company that makes the emergency transmitters, had said that it backed the proposal to switch them off while investigations continued, but added that it was \\"premature to jump to conclusions\\". Last week, two airlines disclosed issues with the wiring on their Boeing 787's emergency transmitters, Japan's All Nippon Airways (ANA), the world's biggest operator of Dreamliners, said last week it found damage to the battery wiring on two 787 locator transmitters during checks.

He had never been to the mountains. No squirrel in all the Center Kingdom, as far as he knew, had ever been to the mountains. For between the kingdom and the mountains, surrounding it on all sides like a moat around a castle, there lay a blasted concrete wasteland, as wide as fifty squirrels laid nose to tail, and horrific death machines roared up and down this wasteland at terrifying speeds, all day and night. What's more, humans and dogs often crossed between the mountains and the kingdoms. And sometimes the dogs were not leashed. A squirrel would have to be very desperate indeed to dare the wastelands. It was Toro who had told Patch about the food in the mountains. Toro was Patch's friend. And that itself was extraordinary. Patch had always talked to birds. The drey he had grown up in -- Silver's old drey, before she became leader of the Seeker clan -- had been only a few branches away from a nest of robins. Once, in early spring when he was still a baby, Patch had crawled out of Silver's drey and into the robin's nest, and had spent a whole day among the chicks before Silver returned home and retrieved him. The robin mother had been unamused by Silver's profound apologies, and even less amused when Patch had returned to her nest the very next day. Eventually Silver taught Patch to leave the robins alone, but not before he had learned how to speak Bird. Most squirrels of the Center Kingdom could say and understand a few simple things in Bird, but Patch could actually hold conversations. And so, one autumn day when a bluejay swooped past and stole an acorn out of Patch's paws, Patch shouted angrily at the thief in Bird to bring it back; and the thief, intrigued, wheeled around in midair, perched on a branch above Patch, and looked curiously down at the irate squirrel. \\"Thieving feather-brained no-nose hawkbait!\\" Patch shouted up. \\"Stupid blind furry groundworm!\\" the bluejay retorted, and began to peck at the acorn.

Comisia Europeană declară că doreşte ca discuţiile de aderare cu Turcia să continue într-un ritm mai rapid. Translate to English","output":"The European Commission states that it wants the accession talks with Turkey to continue at a faster pace. The European Commission, the executive body of the European Union, has expressed its desire for the ongoing accession talks with Turkey to progress more rapidly. These talks pertain to Turkey's potential accession to the European Union, a process that has been in motion since 1987 but has faced several delays and complications over the years.  The need for a more swift pace of discussions highlights the importance of ensuring regional stability, fostering economic cooperation, and promoting the shared values of democratic governance and human rights between the European Union and Turkey. By stating this desire, the European Commission also acknowledges the strategic importance of the relationship between the two sides, particularly in areas such as security, energy, migration policies, and regional development. There have been numerous challenges surrounding Turkey's accession, and the process has been subject to criticism and controversy on both sides. Some of the key issues at the heart of these discussions include concerns over democratic backsliding in Turkey, human rights abuses, freedom of the press, and the need for stronger economic reforms. The accession talks have been stalled for quite some time, with the last significant milestone being the opening of the 16th chapter of negotiations back in 2016. However, despite these challenges, the European Commission's statement indicates a renewed interest and commitment to moving the discussions forward. This could be due to the changing geopolitical landscape and the need for stronger collaboration to tackle global issues such as climate change, terrorism, and the recent refugee crisis. For the accession talks to be successful, Turkey would need to demonstrate progress in addressing these critical areas while displaying a willingness to align itself more closely with the values and norms of the European Union. The European Union, on the other hand, would need to show flexibility in its approach and be prepared to engage in serious dialogue with Turkey, keeping in mind the importance of this strategic partnership. In conclusion, the European Commission's call for more rapid accession talks with Turkey underscores the need for a constructive and pragmatic approach to navigating this complex process. This would require both sides to demonstrate a commitment to shared goals, mutual respect, and a spirit of collaboration, fostering stronger ties between Turkey and the European Union amidst an increasingly challenging global environment."},{"instruction":"Question: I know that the answer to the question \\"Why do monks meditate?\\" is in \\"Theravadin Buddhists believe that personal effort is required to realize rebirth.

Treasuries Mirror Oil's Climb  NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury yields hit their lowest  level in almost seven months on Monday as record high oil  prices clouded the outlook for global economic growth. Multi-choice problem: What is this text about? Available choices: a. World. b. Sports. c. Business. d. Science/Tech.","output":"This text is about the business domain, specifically relating to the financial market and the economic impact of rising oil prices. It discusses how U.S. Treasury yields reached their lowest level in nearly seven months due to the influence of record high oil prices, which in turn affects the global economic growth outlook. The excerpt is from a news report in the business context, as it highlights important financial indicators which are Treasury yields in the United States and how they are being affected by the increasing oil prices. Rising oil prices have a significant impact on the global economy, as it is an essential commodity required for transportation, industrial production, and various consumer goods. Higher oil prices can increase production costs, inflate consumer prices, and affect trade balances for countries heavily reliant on oil imports.  As a result, the text touches upon the implications of the increasing oil prices on Treasury yields, a key financial market instrument that reflects investor sentiment on the overall well-being of the economy. Treasuries are debt securities issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury to fund the country's spending needs. The yield on these securities is inversely related to their prices and serves as an indicator for interest rates and economic growth expectations. A lower yield often indicates a weaker outlook for the economy, pushing investors to seek safer investments like government bonds. In this case, the declining Treasury yields are connected to the potentially negative consequences of the rising oil prices, which can hinder global economic growth and create uncertainty in the financial markets. Hence, the text pertains to the business sector, with emphasis on finance and how global economic conditions are reflected in the U.S. Treasury yields, which, in turn, are influenced by the fluctuations in oil prices."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Two of these (1 and 3) might explain why there are volcanoes at convergent plate boundaries the temperature of the subducting plate increases as it sinks into the hot mantle (1). Sediments lying on top of the subducting plate contain water. As the sediments subduct, the water rises into the overlying mantle material. This lowers the melting temperature of the mantle (3). When the mantle above the subducting plate melts, volcanoes form above it. This leads to volcanoes in an island arc or continental arc.

Background: Samuel de Champlain (also known as \\"The Father of New France) (French: [samYel d@ Saple] born Samuel Champlain; on or before August 13, 1574 - December 25, 1635), \\"The Father of New France\\", was a French navigator, cartographer, draftsman, soldier, explorer, geographer, ethnologist, diplomat, and chronicler. He made from 21-29 trips across the Atlantic, and founded New France and Quebec City on July 3, 1608. He is important to Canadian history because he made the first accurate map of the coast and he helped found the settlements. Context: In the spring of 1608, Dugua wanted Champlain to start a new French colony and fur trading center on the shores of the St. Lawrence. Dugua equipped, at his own expense, a fleet of three ships with workers, that left the French port of Honfleur. The main ship, called the Don-de-Dieu (French for the Gift of God), was commanded by Champlain. Another ship, the Levrier (the Hunt Dog), was commanded by his friend Du Pont. The small group of male settlers arrived at Tadoussac on the lower St. Lawrence in June. Because of the dangerous strength of the Saguenay River ending there, they left the ships and continued up the \\"Big River\\" in small boats bringing the men and the materials.  On July 3, 1608, Champlain landed at the \\"point of Quebec\\" and set about fortifying the area by the erection of three main wooden buildings, each two stories tall, that he collectively called the \\"Habitation\\", with a wooden stockade and a moat 12 feet (4 m) wide surrounding them. This was the very beginning of Quebec City. Gardening, exploring, and fortifying this place became great passions of Champlain for the rest of his life.  In the 1620s, the Habitation at Quebec was mainly a store for the Compagnie des Marchands (Traders Company), and Champlain lived in the wooden Fort Saint Louis newly built up the hill (south from the present-day Chateau Frontenac Hotel), near the only two houses built by the two settler families (the ones of Louis Hebert and Guillaume Couillard, his son-in-law). Question: Are there any other interesting aspects about this article? Answer:","output":"Yes, there are several interesting aspects in this article about Samuel de Champlain, \\"The Father of New France.\\"  1. Cartography Skills: Champlain was an accomplished cartographer, which played an important role in mapping the Canadian coastline. His accurate maps were crucial for navigation, the establishment of trade routes, and exploration of the territories. His cartographic skills helped the French government and other explorers to understand and utilize the new lands more effectively. 2. Diplomatic Relations with Indigenous People: Champlain focused on establishing good relations with the Indigenous peoples living in New France. He learned their languages and customs, engaged in trade, and formed alliances for mutual benefits. This approach played a significant role in the success of New France, as it enabled the French to secure valuable trade routes and resources. 3. Explorations and Discoveries: Champlain conducted numerous explorations across the North American continent. Some of his notable journeys include the exploration of Ottawa River, which ultimately led to the discovery of the Great Lakes, an essential part of the North American continent. He also explored what is now known as the Bay of Fundy and Lake Champlain, named after him. 4. Military Career: Champlain was also a soldier and took part in various military campaigns during his time. Some of his notable contributions include his role in the battle against the Iroquois Confederacy, during which he utilized European tactics and weapons, significantly influencing the outcome in favor of the French and their Huron allies. 5. Influence on Quebec City's Development: Champlain's influence on the development of Quebec City is also worth mentioning. As the founder of the city, he made significant efforts to fortify the settlement, build infrastructure such as forts, gardens, and living quarters, and establish trade with the Indigenous peoples. His tireless endeavors allowed Quebec City to prosper and become a central hub in New France. 6. Legacy and Impact on Canadian History: Samuel de Champlain's contributions to the establishment and development of New France significantly shaped Canadian history. His explorations, diplomacy, and vision for a thriving French settlement set the foundation for modern-day Quebec and influenced various aspects of Canadian culture and relations with Indigenous peoples. In conclusion, the article about Samuel de Champlain offers many fascinating details on his life, his explorations, and his vital role in the founding and development of New France. From his mapping abilities to his diplomatic skills, Champlain's legacy continues to influence and shape Canadian history today."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Text: The Vice President of the United States (informally referred to as VPOTUS, or Veep) is a constitutional officer in the legislative branch of the federal government of the United States as the President of the Senate under Article I, Section 3, Clause 4, of the United States Constitution, as well as the second highest executive branch officer, after the President of the United States. In accordance with the 25th Amendment, he is the highest-ranking official in the presidential line of succession, and is a statutory member of the National Security Council under the National Security Act of 1947. Question: is the vice president president of the senate?","output":"Yes, the Vice President of the United States serves as the President of the Senate according to the U.S. Constitution. This role is clearly defined in Article I, Section 3, Clause 4, of the United States Constitution.  The Vice President's position as President of the Senate makes them a pivotal figure within the legislative branch of the federal government. Their primary duty in this role is to preside over Senate sessions. However, it should be noted that the Vice President does not have a vote in the Senate, except in the case where there is a tie on a piece of legislation or matter being decided on. In such an instance, the Vice President, as President of the Senate, casts the tie-breaking vote. This makes the Vice President the only individual who holds positions in both the executive and legislative branches of the U.S. government, thus serving a crucial bridge between the two. The Vice President has a significant responsibility to ensure smooth legislative proceedings and contribute to the maintenance of a beneficial relationship between the executive and legislative branches. Moreover, the Vice President plays an instrumental part in the presidential line of succession. As noted in the 25th Amendment to the Constitution, the Vice President is the first in line to assume the presidency if for any reason the President is unable to serve. This highlights the importance of the Vice President's role not only as a legislative leader but also as a key figure in the executive branch. The Vice President is also recognized as a statutory member of the National Security Council as per the National Security Act of 1947. This designates them an official role in national security and foreign policy decisions, further extending their influence and responsibilities in the U.S. government. All these aspects, together, outline the multifaceted role of the Vice President as the President of the Senate and a key figure in the federal government of the United States."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Bach is known as a prolific composer of cantatas. When he assumed the position as Thomaskantor (director of church music) in Leipzig in 1723, he began the project to write church cantatas for the occasions of the liturgical year – Sundays and feast days – a project that he pursued for three years.Bach was appointed organist and chamber musician in Weimar at the court of the co-reigning dukes in Saxe-Weimar, Wilhelm Ernst and his nephew Ernst August on 25 June 1708. He had composed sacred cantatas before, some during his tenure in Mühlhausen from 1706 to 1708. Most were written for special occasions and were based mainly on biblical texts and hymns. Examples include: Aus der Tiefen rufe ich, Herr, zu dir, BWV 131; the early chorale cantata Christ lag in Todes Banden, BWV 4 for Easter; Gott ist mein König, BWV 71, to celebrate the inauguration of the new city council on 4 February 1708; and the Actus Tragicus for a funeral. In Weimar, Bach first concentrated on the organ, composing major works for the instrument, including the Orgelbüchlein, the Toccata and Fugue in D minor, BWV 565, and the Prelude and Fugue in E major, BWV 566. Christoph Wolff suggests that Bach may have studied musical material belonging to the Hofkapelle, (\\"court capelle\\" or court orchestra), and that he copied and studied works by Johann Philipp Krieger, Christoph Graupner, Georg Philipp Telemann, Marco Giuseppe Peranda and Johann David Heinichen in the period from 1711 to 1713. In early 1713 Bach composed his first cantatas in the new style that included recitatives and arias: the so-called Hunting Cantata, BWV 208, as a homage cantata for Christian, Duke of Saxe-Weissenfels, celebrated on 23 February, and possibly the church cantata for Sexagesima (the second Sunday before Lent) Gleichwie der Regen und Schnee vom Himmel fällt, BWV 18, on a text by Erdmann Neumeister.In 1713, he was asked to apply for the position of music director of the Marktkirche in Halle, succeeding Friedrich Wilhelm Zachow.

Summarize: For most women, vaginal discharge is perfectly normal and can range from being clear to milky white. Abnormal discharge will look greenish-yellow and frothy. A strong odour is also a sign of abnormal discharge.  Trichomoniasis is spread through contact with vaginal discharge which happens most often during vaginal intercourse. However, non-sexual transmission can sometimes occur from penetration from other items like douche nozzles. Fortunately, the parasite can only last up to 24 hours outside of the body. Trichomoniasis can cause redness, burning, and itching sensations at the genitals in some infected individuals. These symptoms may indicate a possible trichomoniasis infection or that of another STI.  Trichomoniasis causes irritation within the vaginal canal or vulva. Vaginal irritation can be normal if the irritation only lasts for a few days or gets better after treatment. However, if irritation persists or gets worse, it's best to talk to your doctor about it and get it properly diagnosed and treated. Trichomoniasis can cause inflammation and soreness in the genitals that can make intercourse uncomfortable. See a physician if you experience these symptoms, and do not participate in intercourse until you have been tested for STIs or STDs.  Avoid all forms of sexual intercourse including anal and oral sex until you've been tested and cleared. You should also inform your sexual partner or partners if you suspect you have an STI/STD and encourage them to also get tested and treated. Some clinics will help you inform your partners anonymously by giving them a contact slip that lets them know they have been exposed to a sexually transmitted infection. It won't have your name on it and it won't necessarily tell them what the infection is.","output":"Vaginal discharge is normal for women, but abnormal discharge with a strong odor may indicate an infection like trichomoniasis.

In this article, a Mississippi man named Kevin Curtis was accused of sending ricin-laced poison letters to President Barack Obama, a U.S. senator, and a state judge. However, his lawyer, Christi McCoy, argued that he was framed by a former friend. She said that whoever framed him was able to lead the FBI to him by including his catchphrase \\"I'm KC and I approve this message\\" in the threatening notes. The correct answer is that Curtis is absolutely 100 per cent innocent, according to McCoy. The other options are incorrect because they mention different names or places that are not relevant to the statement made by McCoy.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Every country has its traditional festivals. The Chinese New Year is now known as the Spring Festival because it starts from the beginning of spring. Though there are some sayings about its origin, all agree that the word Nian, which in modern Chinese means \\"year\\", was originally the name of a beast that started to eat people the night before the beginning of a new year. One story goes that the beast Nian had a very big mouth that would take in a great many people at one time. People were very afraid. One day, an old man came to their help and said he would stop all this. He said to Nian, \\"I hear that you are very strong, but can you eat up all the beasts on earth instead of people who are too weak to be your enemies?\\" \\"Yes,\\" Nian agreed with him and went to kill many of the beasts on earth. People were very happy because those beasts also did bad things to people and killed their farm animals from time to time. After that, the old man, who was a god, rode on the beast Nian and left. Nian was gone, and other beasts also went into forests; people began to enjoy their happy life. Before the old man left, he had told people to put up red paper-cuts on their windows and doors at each year's end to drive Nian away, because red is the color the beast felt most afraid of. From then on, every year at the beginning of spring, people prepare to \\"Guo Nian\\". The word \\"Guo Nian\\" means \\"go through the Nian safely\\". Putting up red paper-cuts to drive Nian away and making dumplings for a better new year are still an every-year doing by the Chinese people. However, people today have long forgotten why they are doing all this, they just feel the color and the food make the New Year very enjoyable. Options: A Nian can eat up all the beasts on earth at one time. B Nian is a tall beast that likes to eat farm animals. C Nian is afraid of red paper-cuts. D Nian doesn't like to use his own mind.

Question: This article: The term \\"Viking metal\\" has sometimes been used as a nickname for the 1990s Norwegian black metal scene, which was \\"noisy, chaotic, and often augmented by sorrowful keyboard melodies\\". It has also been variously described as a subgenre of black metal, albeit one that abandoned black metal's Satanic imagery, \\"slow black metal\\" with influences from Nordic folk music, straddling black metal and folk metal almost equally, or running the gamut from \\"folk to black to death metal\\". Typically, Viking metal artists rely extensively on keyboards, which are often played at a \\"swift, galloping pace\\". These artists often add \\"local cultural flourishes\\" such as traditional instruments and ethnic melodies. It is similar to folk metal, and is sometimes categorized as such, but it uses folk instruments less extensively. For vocals, Viking metal incorporates both singing and the typical black metal screams and growls. Overall, Viking metal is hard to define since, apart from certain elements like anthem-like choruses, it is not based entirely on musical features and overlaps with other metal genres, with origins in black and death metal Some bands, such as Unleashed and Amon Amarth, play death metal, but incorporate Viking themes and thus are labeled as part of the genre. Generally, Viking metal is defined more by its thematic material and imagery than musical qualities. Rather than being a mock-up of medieval music, \\"it is in the band names, album titles, artwork of album covers and, especially, in the song lyrics that Viking themes are so evident.\\" Viking metal, and the closely related style pagan metal, is more of a term or \\"etiquette\\" than a musical style. Since they are defined chiefly by lyrical focus, any musical categorizations of these two styles is controversial. Thus, Viking metal is more of a cross-genre term than a descriptor of a certain sound. Ashby and Schofield write that \\"The term 'Viking metal' is one of many that falls within a complex web of genres and subgenres, the precise form of which is constantly... contains an answer for the question: What genres are defined chiefly by lyrical focus?, what is it ?

He knows what it takes to be cool and have some style, it is just that he seems to struggle to get there. Danny has enthusiasm and passion and only wants two things more than anything in the world.

News article: Commuting is among life's least enjoyable activities, according to research by Nobel Prize winner Daniel Kahneman and others. The graph below shows the cities with the worst commutes in the world, according to IBM's Commuter Pain Index (via Wired).                  The city with the world's worst commute, according to the IBM study, is Beijing, followed by Mexico City, Johannesburg, Moscow, and New Delhi. London, New York, L.A., and my adopted hometown of Toronto also rank in the top 20. Stockholm has the world's best commute among the 20 cities in the IBM survey.      Commuting is a waste of energy and time, and carries with it enormous economic costs. Commuting costs America an estimated 90 billion dollars per year in terms of lost productivity and wasted energy, according to the annual Urban Mobility Report. Our own detailed calculations by Martin Prosperity Institute (MPI) research director Kevin Stolarick find that every minute shaved off America's commuting time is worth an estimated 19.5 billion dollars. That translates into 97.7 billion for five minutes, 195 billion for 10 minutes, and 292 billion for every 15 minutes saved nationally.      The chart below from the IBM study shows the percentage of drivers in each of the 20 surveyed cities who would work more if their commuting time was significantly reduced.                  The index is based on IBM surveys of 8,192 motorists in 20 cities across six continents:      The index is comprised of 10 issues: 1) commuting time, 2) time stuck in traffic, agreement that: 3) price of gas is already too high, 4) traffic has gotten worse, 5) start-stop traffic is a problem, 6) driving causes stress, 7) driving causes anger, 8) traffic affects work, 9) traffic so bad driving stopped, and 10) decided not to make trip due to traffic.      We want to hear what you think about this article. Submit a letter to the editor or write to letters@theatlantic.com. ||||| Quit whining about your commute. It isn’t that bad, even for you Angelinos and New Yorkers. Your daily slog through traffic is nothing compared to Moscow, where people might spend more than three hours sucking exhaust fumes while going nowhere fast.      Even that pales compared to New Delhi, where 96 percent of drivers say their commute is so hellish it harms their health. And you’ll get no sympathy in Beijing, where traffic can get so bad that almost 7 out of 10 drivers have at some point said, “Screw this” and gone home.      Number-crunchers at IBM Research surveyed 8,192 motorists in 20 cities, and — no surprise — most of them think traffic has only grown worse during the past three years. More than half said gridlock has wreaked havoc on their physical or mental health. One-third said it is undercutting their productivity at work or school.      As IBM notes, mounting congestion is relatively new phenomenon in emerging markets where the economy is growing faster than the infrastructure. That stands in contrast to cities like New York, Houston and Los Angeles, where growth has occurred over time, allowing traffic engineers to at least try to keep up.      But no matter the cause, we can’t pave our way out of this.      “Traditional solutions — building more roads — will not be enough to overcome the growth of traffic in these rapidly developing cities, so multiple solutions need to be deployed simultaneously to avoid a failure of the transportation networks,” says Naveen Lamba, who has the unusual title of IBM global industry lead for intelligent transportation. “New technologies are required that empower transportation officials to better understand and proactively manage the flow of traffic.”      You’d expect IBM to say that since it is developing just that sort of technology. But the numbers back it up. China is the world’s largest auto market, and traffic volume in Beijing is growing 10 percent annually. Moscow says unsnarling its roads will cost 6.5 billion. The average traffic speed in New Delhi will fall from 15 km/hr to just 5 by the end of next year. The list goes on.      IBM used the results to compile a “Commuter Pain Index,” which ranks the emotional and economic toll of commuting. The index is a measure of 10 criteria, from the amount of time spent sitting in traffic to the frequency with which people simply gave up and went home.      Here it is, by the numbers:      Some highlights, or maybe we should say low points, from the study:      Forty-nine percent of respondents say traffic has gotten worse in the past three years and 18 percent say it is a lot worse. Oddly, 16 percent of those surveyed in Beijing and 17 percent of those in New Delhi say things have improved.      Almost nine in 10 respondents say they’ve sat in gridlocked traffic at some point during the past three years. The average delay was 1 hour, but Muscovites wish it was that long. They’re used to spending an average of 2.5 hours sitting still in the worst tie-ups. Forty percent said they’ve spent three hours or more in stymied traffic.      Thirty-one percent of respondents said they’ve encountered traffic so bad they simply turned around and went home. That number climbed to 69 percent for residents of Beijing.      Here in the United States, 85 percent of respondents say traffic is as bad or worse now than it was three years ago. But that doesn’t mean they’re about to change their behavior. More than 8 in 10 people drive solo to work — compared to 50 percent for the rest of the world — and only 3.1 percent carpool.      Perhaps that’s why we spend more money driving than we do on groceries.      IBM’s web-based survey, conducted by Survey Sampling International in 2008 and 2009 and released today, has a margin of error of plus or minus 2 points overall and plus or minus 5 points when comparing cities. Respondents were drivers between 18 and 65 years old.      Photo of just another traffic jam in Moscow: Leszek Golubinski/Flickr ||||| Armonk, NY - 30 Jun 2010: -- Moscow copes with the two-and-a-half hour traffic jam      -- Despite congestion, Beijing drivers report improvement in traffic      -- Houston, New York and Los Angeles fare well, relatively speaking      The daily commute in some of the world's most economically important international cities is longer and more grueling than before imagined, reflecting the failure of transportation infrastructure to keep pace with economic activity, according to IBM's (NYSE: IBM) first global Commuter Pain study released today.      IBM surveyed 8,192 motorists in 20 cities on six continents, the majority of whom say that traffic has gotten worse in the past three years. The congestion in many of today's developing cities is a relatively recent phenomenon, having paralleled the rapid economic growth of those cities during the past decade or two. By contrast, the traffic in places like New York, Los Angeles or London has developed gradually over many decades, giving officials more time and resources to address the problem.      For example, the middle class in China is growing rapidly, with the number of new cars registered in Beijing in the first four months of 2010 rising 23.8% to 248,000, according to the Beijing municipal taxation office. Beijing's total investments in its subway system are projected to be more than 331.2 billion yuan by 2015 as the city expands the system to more than double its current size, according to Beijing Infrastructure Investment Co., Ltd. The city plans to invest 80 billion yuan in 2010 in building its transportation infrastructure.      The study did offer a number of bright spots. Forty eight percent of drivers surveyed in Beijing reported that traffic has improved in the past three years – the high for the survey – reflecting substantial initiatives to improve the transportation network in that city. In addition, the commute for drivers in Stockholm, Sweden seems to be, if not pleasant, then largely pain-free. Only 14% of Stockholm drivers surveyed said that roadway traffic negatively affected work or school performance.      Overall, though, the study paints a picture of metropolitan-area commuters in many cities struggling to get to and from work each day. For example, 57% of all respondents say that roadway traffic has negatively affected their health, but that percentage is 96% in New Delhi and 95% in Beijing.      Similarly, 29% overall say that roadway traffic has negatively affected work or school performance, but that percentage rises to 84% in Beijing, 62% in New Delhi, and 56% in Mexico City.      Moscow was notable for the duration of its traffic jams. Drivers there reported an average delay of two-and-a-half hours when asked to report the length of the worst traffic jam they experienced in the past three years.      IBM Commuter Pain Index      IBM compiled the results of the survey into an Index that ranks the emotional and economic toll of commuting in each city on a scale of one to 100, with 100 being the most onerous. The Index reveals a tremendous disparity in the pain of the daily commute from city to city. Stockholm had the least painful commute of the cities studied, followed by Melbourne and Houston (which tied) and New York City. Here's how the cities stack up:      The index is comprised of 10 issues: 1) commuting time, 2) time stuck in traffic, agreement that: 3) price of gas is already too high, 4) traffic has gotten worse, 5) start-stop traffic is a problem, 6) driving causes stress, 7) driving causes anger, 8) traffic affects work, 9) traffic so bad driving stopped, and 10) decided not to make trip due to traffic. The cities scored as follows: Beijing: 99, Mexico City: 99, Johannesburg: 97, Moscow: 84, New Delhi: 81, Sao Paolo: 75, Milan: 52, Buenos Aires: 50, Madrid: 48, London: 36, Paris: 36, Toronto: 32, Amsterdam: 25, Los Angeles: 25, Berlin: 24, Montreal: 23, New York: 19, Houston: 17, Melbourne: 17, Stockholm: 15.      \\"Traditional solutions -- building more roads -- will not be enough to overcome the growth of traffic in these rapidly developing cities, so multiple solutions need to be deployed simultaneously to avoid a failure of the transportation networks,\\" said Naveen Lamba, IBM's global industry lead for intelligent transportation. \\"New techniques are required that empower transportation officials to better understand and proactively manage the flow of traffic.\\"      IBM Global Commuter Pain Survey – Major Findings      Analysis of the survey results indicated a number of key findings related to how traffic impacts commuters:      The Commuter Pain Survey was conducted by IBM to better understand consumer thinking toward traffic congestion as the issue reaches crisis proportions nationwide and higher levels of auto emissions stir environmental concerns. These events are impacting communities around the world, where governments, citizens and private sector organizations are looking beyond traditional remedies like additional roads and greater access to public transportation to reverse the negative impacts of increased road congestion.      This year marks the first global Commuter Pain survey. IBM previously conducted the Commuter Pain survey in the United States in 2008 and 2009.      IBM is actively working in the area of Smarter Transportation using a worldwide team of scientists, industry experts and IT services professionals to research, test and deploy new traffic information management capabilities in cities around the world. Findings from the Commuter Pain Survey will be used to assess citizen concerns about traffic and commuter issues; expand solutions like automated tolling, real-time traffic prediction, congestion charging, and intelligent route planning; and serve as a basis for pioneering innovative new approaches to traffic mitigation. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"Commuting is considered one of life's least enjoyable activities, with cities such as Beijing, Mexico City, Johannesburg, Moscow, and New Delhi having the worst commutes in the world, according to IBM's Commuter Pain Index. Commuting costs America an estimated 90 billion per year in lost productivity and wasted energy, and every minute shaved off commuting time is worth approximately 19.5 billion. IBM's survey is based on 10 factors, including commuting time, time stuck in traffic, and the impact on mental health and work, and was conducted with 8,192 motorists across 20 cities on six continents. The study highlights the need for innovative solutions to tackle traffic congestion as traditional methods, such as building more roads, are insufficient for the rapid growth in developing cities."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: The White Ribbon Movie plot: The action takes place in a German village in the fifteen months that precede World War I.Among the people who live there are a baron, who is a large landowner and a local moral authority, his estate manager, a pastor with his many children, a widowed doctor and a schoolteacher who is thinking of getting married. It is he who, many years later, tells this story.Though everything seems to be quiet and orderly, as it always has been, with the seasons following each other, and good harvests following bad ones, suddenly some strange events start to occur. If some appear to be quite ordinary, even accidental -- a farmer's wife dies falling through rotten floorboards -- others are inexplicable and may well be malevolent.Thus, a wire placed at knee-height has brought down the horse being ridden by the doctor, who is severely wounded.There's more of the same: an unknown hand opens a window to expose a newborn baby to the intense cold of the winter. A whole field of cabbages, on the baron's land, are beheaded with a scythe. One of the Baron's sons disappears: he is found his feet and hands bound, his buttocks lashed by a whip. A barn belonging to the manor is set on fire. A farmer hangs himself. A midwife's handicapped child is found tied to a tree, in a forest, seriously beaten, with a threatening message on his chest speaking of divine punishment.The village is worried, and at a loss as to what to do. The baron whose wife will soon leave the village to go to live in Italy makes a speech in the church, but it has no effect. The pastor, a particularly strict character, had since the beginning of the events, tied a white ribbon to the arm of his two eldest children, a boy and a girl: it is to remind them permanently of their duties to purity.

The phenomenon of biochemical processes' serving to regulate distant tissues by means of secretions directly into the circulatory system is called endocrine signaling. The major endocrine glands include the pineal gland, pituitary gland, pancreas, ovaries, testes, thyroid gland, parathyroid gland, and adrenal glands. The endocrine system is in contrast to the exocrine system, which secretes its hormones to the outside of the body using ducts. The endocrine system is an information signal system like the nervous system, yet its effects and mechanism are classifiably different. The endocrine system's effects are slow to initiate, and prolonged in their response, lasting from a few hours up to weeks. The nervous system sends information very quickly, and responses are generally short lived. In vertebrates, the hypothalamus is the neural control center for all endocrine systems. The field of study dealing with the endocrine system and its disorders is endocrinology, a branch of internal medicine. Special features of endocrine glands are, in general, their ductless nature, their vascularity, and commonly the presence of intracellular vacuoles or granules that store their hormones. In contrast, exocrine glands, such as salivary glands, sweat glands, and glands within the gastrointestinal tract, tend to be much less vascular and have ducts or a hollow lumen.  - A hormone (from the Greek participle ) is any member of a class of signaling molecules produced by glands in multicellular organisms that are transported by the circulatory system to target distant organs to regulate physiology and behaviour. Hormones have diverse chemical structures, mainly of 3 classes: eicosanoids, steroids, and amino acid derivatives (amines, peptides, and proteins). The glands that secrete hormones comprise the endocrine signaling system. The term hormone is sometimes extended to include chemicals produced by cells that affect the same cell (autocrine or intracrine signalling) or nearby cells (paracrine signalling).  - An anesthesiologist (American English) or anaesthetist (British English) is a physician trained in anesthesia and perioperative medicine.  - The pancreas is a glandular organ in the digestive system and endocrine system of vertebrates. In humans, it is located in the abdominal cavity behind the stomach. It is an endocrine gland producing several important hormones, including insulin, glucagon, somatostatin, and pancreatic polypeptide which circulate in the blood. The pancreas is also a digestive organ, secreting pancreatic juice containing digestive enzymes that assist digestion and absorption of nutrients in the small intestine. These enzymes help to further break down the carbohydrates, proteins, and lipids in the chyme. The pancreas is also known as mixed gland.  - The stomach is a muscular, hollow, dilated part of the gastrointestinal tract that functions as an important organ in the digestive system. The stomach is present in many animals including vertebrates, echinoderms, insects (mid-gut), and molluscs. In humans and many other vertebrates it is involved in the second phase of digestion, following mastication (chewing).  - Liver transplantation or hepatic transplantation is the replacement of a diseased liver with some or all of a healthy liver from another person (allograft). The most commonly used technique is phototropic transplantation, in which the native liver is removed and replaced by the donor organ in the same anatomic location as the original liver. Liver transplantation is a viable treatment option for end-stage liver disease and acute liver failure. Typically three surgeons and two anesthesiologists are involved, with up to four supporting nurses. The surgical procedure is very demanding and ranges from 4 to 18 hours depending on outcome. Numerous anastomoses and sutures, and many disconnections and reconnections of abdominal and liver tissue, must be made for the transplant to succeed, requiring an eligible recipient and a well-calibrated live or cadaveric donor match.  - A cadaver, also called corpse (singular) in medical, literary, and legal usage, or when intended for dissection, is a deceased body. The obsolete British term \\"lich\\" for \\"corpse\\", sometimes spelled \\"lych\\", is no longer even listed in major British dictionaries such as Longman, Macmillan, Cambridge, or Oxford Online Dictionaries. However, the term \\"lich\\" has been revived in modern fantasy fiction for a type of \\"undead\\" creature.  - Echinoderm is the common name given to any member of the phylum Echinodermata (from Ancient Greek, , \\"echinos\\"  \\"hedgehog\\" and , \\"derma\\"  \\"skin\\") of marine animals. The adults are recognizable by their (usually five-point) radial symmetry, and include such well-known animals as sea stars, sea urchins, sand dollars, and sea cucumbers, as well as the sea lilies or \\"stone lilies\\". Echinoderms are found at every ocean depth, from the intertidal zone to the abyssal zone. The phylum contains about 7000 living species, making it the second-largest grouping of deuterostomes (a superphylum), after the chordates (which include the vertebrates, such as birds, fishes, mammals, and reptiles). Echinoderms are also the largest phylum that has no freshwater or terrestrial (land-based) representatives.  - Pancreatic juice is a liquid secreted by the pancreas, which contains a variety of enzymes, including trypsinogen, chymotrypsinogen, elastase, carboxypeptidase, pancreatic lipase, nucleases and amylase. The pancreas is located in the visceral region, and is a major part of the digestive system required for proper digestion and subsequent assimilation of macronutrient substances required for living.   - Endocrine glands are glands of the endocrine system that secrete their products, \\"hormones\\", directly into the blood rather than through a duct. The major glands of the endocrine system include the pineal gland, pituitary gland, pancreas, ovaries, testes, thyroid gland, parathyroid gland, hypothalamus and adrenal glands. The hypothalamus and pituitary gland are neuroendocrine organs.  Local chemical messengers, not generally considered part of the endocrine system, include autocrines, which act on the cells that secrete them, and paracrines, which act on a different cell type nearby.

Q:I can use this background: When you go to the dentist to get a tooth pulled, you really don’t want to feel any pain. The dentist injects an anesthetic into your gum and it eventually becomes numb. One theory as to why anesthetics work deals with the movement of ions across the cell membrane. The anesthetic gets into the membrane structure and causes shifts in how ions move across the membrane. If ion movement is disrupted, nerve impulses will not be transmitted and you will not sense pain – at least not until the anesthetic wears off.  Now, I have a new situation: In a doctor's office, two siblings both are having a small operation performed on their fingers in order to correct an identical injury. The movement of Joe's ions has been disrupted completely, but Emily's ions are still able to move normally.  Answer this question please: Who will be more uncomfortable during the operation? A:","output":"Emily will be more uncomfortable during the operation. Since Joe's ions movement has been disrupted completely, it means that the anesthetic has effectively numbed his affected area, blocking nerve impulses and preventing him from feeling pain during the operation. On the other hand, Emily's ions are still able to move normally, indicating that the anesthetic has not successfully numbed her affected area.

Given the question: Article: A dense wave of smog began in the Chinese city of Harbin and the surrounding Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Liaoning Provinces on 20 October 2013. Unseasonably warm temperatures with very little wind across northeastern China coincided with the smoke from local farmers' burning straws and the start-up of Harbin's coal-powered central heating system. Record densities of fine particulates were measured in the city. In Harbin, the levels of PM2.5 (particulate matter) rise to 1,000 micrograms per cubic meter, worse than Beijing's historic highs. Visibility was reduced to below 50m in parts of Harbin, and below 500m in most of the neighbouring Jilin Province. On Fa Yuen Street in Harbin, visibility of less than 5m was reported. The smog reduced after October 23, 2013 and completely broke up on October 28, 2013 by the first local snow and icy rain due to a cold front moving in from Russia. Harbin lies in the north of China where winter temperatures can drop to -40degC, demanding a six-month heating season. Daily particulate levels of more than 40 times the World Health Organization recommended maximum level were reported in parts of Harbin. The smog remained till 23 October, when almost all monitoring stations in Heilongjiang, Jilin,and Liaoning Provincesreported readings above 200mg/m3forPM2.5. PM2.5 is the amount of particulate matter less than 2.5 micrometers in diameter in the air, with the WHO recommending a maximum 24-hour mean   of 25 micrograms per cubic meter (mg/m3). On the morning of 25 October, PM2.5 measurements in Harbin had fallen to an average of 123mg/m3. All highways in the surrounding Heilongjiang Province were closed. In Harbin, all primary and middle schools were closed for three days and authorities stopped flights at the airports. Hospitals reported a 23 percent increase in admissions for breathing problems. However, this smog will have no influence on Harbin Ice Festival events later in December 2013. Air pollution in Chinese cities is of increasing concern to China's leadership. Particulates in...

Bin Laden reportedly discussed the planes operation with KSM and Atef in a series of meetings in the spring of 1999 at the al Matar complex near Kandahar. KSM's original concept of using one of the hijacked planes to make a media statement was scrapped, but  Bin Laden considered the basic idea feasible.  Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM developed an initial list of targets. These included the White House, the U.S. Capitol, the Pentagon, and the World Trade Center. According to KSM,  Bin Laden wanted to destroy the White House and the Pentagon, KSM wanted to strike the World Trade Center, and all of them wanted to hit the Capitol. No one else was involved in the initial selection of targets.  Bin Laden also soon selected four individuals to serve as suicide operatives: Khalid al Mihdhar, Nawaf al Hazmi, Khallad, and Abu Bara al Yemeni. During the al Matar meetings,  Bin Laden told KSM that Mihdhar and Hazmi were so eager to participate in an operation against the United States that they had already obtained U.S. visas. KSM states that they had done so on their own after the suicide of their friend Azzam (Nashiri's cousin) in carrying out the Nairobi bombing. KSM had not met them. His only guidance from  Bin Laden was that the two should eventually go to the United States for pilot training. Hazmi and Mihdhar were Saudi nationals, born in Mecca. Like the others in this initial group of selectees, they were already experienced mujahideen. They had traveled together to fight in Bosnia in a group that journeyed to the Balkans in 1995. By the time Hazmi and Mihdhar were assigned to the planes operation in early 1999, they had visited Afghanistan on several occasions. Khallad was another veteran mujahid, like much of his family. His father had been expelled from Yemen because of his extremist views. Khallad had grown up in Saudi Arabia, where his father knew  Bin Laden, Abdullah Azzam, and Omar Abdel Rahman (the \\"Blind Sheikh\\").

Write a title for this article: Last week’s Las Vegas shootings that left five dead, including two on-duty police officers, coincides with a nationwide increase of officers killed in 2014. According to the Nationwide Law Enforcement Memorial Foundation, 63 officers have died on the job this year compared to 45 at the same time last year -- a 40 percent increase. Twenty-three of those deaths were due to firearm-related incidents, a 53 percent increase from the same time last year. Previously, the overall number of officer fatalities had been on a steady decline since 2011. “We’ve had some good years and right now we’re in a bad one,” said Richard Beary, vice president of the International Association of Chiefs of Police. “In general, we’re seeing more violence in society and that violence in society leads to violence against police officers.” Beary, also the Chief of Police at the University of Central Florida, told FoxNews.com that central Florida is seeing an unusually violent year with two officers killed since February. “These officers had no idea somebody was going to kill cops and it’s a terrible situation and a tragedy,” Beary said. He added IACP is in favor of stronger background checks on people trying to purchase a gun. However, he acknowledged it is nearly impossible to predict or prevent officers’ deaths since many of the shooters have no respect for life. “One of the biggest challenges that all of us have is if somebody is set on taking their own life, they’re not afraid of taking another person's life,” Beary said. “I think that’s what we’re seeing in a lot of these cases, where they murder and then commit suicide.” That is exactly what happened earlier this week in Las Vegas, when Jerad and Amanda Miller shot and killed two Las Vegas Metropolitan Police officers in cold blood while they were on their lunch break. Igor Soldo and Alyn Beck were sitting in a pizza parlor when the shooters ambushed them. It was the first time in the department’s history that two officers were lost at the same time. The community is still coming to terms with their tragic deaths. This week, thousands attended a vigil to mourn the officers, who both leave behind wives and young children. The crowd gathered outside the restaurant where the officers were murdered. “They are some amazing people and to know they were intentionally gunned down, I’m having a hard time grasping it,” said Amber Ayers of Las Vegas.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. When people are huddled at a conference or professional event, the subject often turns to the value of failure and embracing feedback. “It is the key to self improvement!”, many chant, channeling their inner self-help gurus, Sadly, many don’t quite practice what they preach. Seeing the value in critical feedback and the lessons that failure can offer is a tough pill to swallow. For those confident in their capabilities, their social standing (in their companies/communities etc), and their abilities, the pill goes down a little easier. For those who experience imposter syndrome, feel insecure about their work, or are new in their careers, it is more difficult. Here’s the thing: these are not binary personalities. While some people are overly confident about themselves, and some people are overly insecure about themselves, most people have a blend of both. As such, even the most confident people can feel the sting when they get critical feedback or screw something up. This is a guide with some things I have learned over the years about how to turn feedback and failure to your advantage. In my not-so-humble opinion, the perfect blend of a human being is confidence in their ability to execute and accomplish their goals, but with a healthy dose of awareness of their current limitations. Let’s face it, overly confident people are often not just at risk of being swallowed up by ego, but can also lack the empathy to understand other folks they need to work with who don’t share the same confidence. An understanding of our current limitations is healthy. When we understand we are not great at something, but we are eager to learn and improve, it opens us up to counsel and tuition. The confidence piece plays an important role in helping us to remember: “I might suck now, but I am going to learn and get better”. When we have this in our heads it makes the journey more palatable: we know that our failure to succeed right now is temporary and it will improve.

Answer the following question: Why might I embrace the turmoil of being displaced ?","output":"You might embrace the turmoil of being displaced due to various reasons. Here are some possible explanations: Step 1: Identifying potential benefits - Personal growth: Displacement often leads to new experiences and challenges which can help you grow as a person. Stepping out of your comfort zone and facing those challenges head-on will likely give you a sense of accomplishment and make you more resilient. - Cultural exposure: Experiencing other cultures can broaden your understanding and appreciation of the world. Displacement exposes you to diverse customs, values, and ways of life, which can be enriching and enlightening. - Strengthening relationships with loved ones: Being away from home might make you appreciate your relationships with your family and friends more. Such experiences can also bring families closer together, as they go through difficult times and support each other. - Self-discovery: Being displaced may provide you with the opportunity to discover more about yourself, your values, interests, and strengths. This can be done through introspection and reallocating your priorities. Step 2: Weighing potential drawbacks against benefits - Though displacement comes with discomfort and homesickness, there is a chance that embracing the challenges associated with it outweighs those drawbacks. Especially when considering the growth and development that could come from stepping out of one's comfort zone. Step 3: Acknowledging emotional attachment - Embracing the turmoil of displacement might also be a way of staying connected to the city and the people you consider home. The strong emotional attachment to the place you grew up could be a driving factor that helps you adapt, grow and reaffirm your dedication to that sole location. Step 4: Acceptance of mother's wisdom - As you mentioned that your mother is always right, this sentiment could factor into your willingness to embrace displacement and essentially \\"prove\\" her right by taking her suggested path. Step 5: Conclusion - You might embrace the turmoil of being displaced due to personal growth, cultural exposure, strengthening relationships with loved ones, self-discovery, emotional attachment, and acceptance of your mother's wisdom. These factors together potentially outweigh the discomfort of feeling homesick and could be the catalyst for embracing the challenges that come with displacement."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Claiming that he joined the military because he \\"got lost on the way to college\\", Swofford finds his time at Camp Pendleton difficult, and struggles to make friends. While Swofford feigns illness to avoid his responsibilities, a \\"lifer\\", Staff Sergeant Sykes, takes note of his potential and orders Swofford to attend his Scout Sniper course. After grueling training, the Scout Sniper course is left with eight candidates, among them Swofford, now a sniper, and Swofford's roommate Corporal Alan Troy who becomes his spotter. When Iraq invades Kuwait, Swofford's unit is deployed to the Arabian Peninsula as a part of Operation Desert Shield. Eager for combat, the Marines find themselves bored with remedial training, constant drills, and a routine monotony that feeds their boredom, and prompts them to talk about the unfaithful girlfriends and wives waiting for them at home. They even erect a bulletin board featuring photographs and brief notes telling what perfidies the women had committed. Swofford obtains unauthorized alcohol and organizes an impromptu Christmas party, arranging for Fergus to cover his watch so he can celebrate. Fergus accidentally sets fire to a tent while cooking some sausages and ignites a crate of flares, waking the whole camp and enraging Staff Sergeant Sykes, who demotes Swofford from lance corporal to private and puts him on \\"shit-burning\\" detail.

The 10-inch LP however had a longer life in the United Kingdom, where important early British rock and roll albums such as Lonnie Donegan's Lonnie Donegan Showcase and Billy Fury's The Sound of Fury were released in that form. The 7-inch (175 mm) 45 rpm disc or \\"single\\" established a significant niche for shorter duration discs, typically containing one item on each side. The 45 rpm discs typically emulated the playing time of the former 78 rpm discs, while the 12-inch LP discs eventually provided up to one half-hour of recorded material per side.\\".

Please write a short summary for the following article: Xbox Live Exec Talks Xbox One -- It's More Than A Game Console Xbox One comes out on Friday (image: Microsoft) The noise level at San Francisco’s Broadway Studios could best be described as cacophonic as dozens of gamers tested out Microsoft's Microsoft's new Xbox One on Sunday, six days ahead of its Friday launch. Microsoft was serving Mountain Dew and Doritos — the two main food groups for at least some gamers — to help fuel the excitement. And, amidst the gamers and tourists in the room was Microsoft Xbox Live programming chief Larry Hyrb. Dressed in business casual, he looked more like a business executive than a gaming maven, but he was treated like a rock star by admiring fans who asked him to pose with them in front of Microsoft’s giant Xbox 18-wheel truck parked at the venue. Scroll down to listen to 11-minute interview Xbox Live director of programming Larry Hyrb Hyrb described “the world 10 years ago” when Microsoft was finishing its design of Xbox 360, as “completely different technologically than it is now in terms of smart phones always connected, social media” and other differences that help shape the direction for Xbox One. But given the time between major console upgrades and the even more accelerated changes in technology, I wondered whether Microsoft, Sony Sony and Nintendo Nintendo can continue to wait years between major upgrades rather than at least annually, like PCs, phones, tables and major technology platforms. Hyrb said the the Xbox was “designed with multiple virtual machines so that we can actually do a lot of fancy upgrading with the exiting machine.” Also, of course, it’s connected with Xbox Live for cloud experiences and updates. He called it “tremendously flexible.” As per changes compared to the Xbox 360 — ”it’s certainly more powerful, the graphics are better but we tuned Xbox One for today’s gaming, meaning certainly high-def, certainly better sound but it’s also the fact that you can instantly resume a game — just like you can on a mobile phone. The system turns on in 13 seconds — completely unheard of 10 years ago.” Kinect built in — why that’s important Kinect – a camera and microphone and motion detector — is an add-on for the Xbox 360 but now built-into Xbox One, which means that developers can assume that every customer who uses a game developed for Xbox One will have access to this important peripheral. Hyrd said that Kinect is integrated at a “low level.” You can use your voice to say ” ‘Xbox On to turn on the system or Xbox Bing show me movies with George Clooney’” to see a list of his films you can watch immediately through the device. Thanks to high resolution tracking, “ the system can see your heart beating.” He said that it can actually see “the blood moving in your face,” which made me wonder about the possible medical uses of the device going forward. Hyrd said that it’s tremendously important to developers that Kinect is now bundled. “Instead of thinking ‘well gee maybe only 10% of the audience is going to see this particular feature of a game, now they’re guaranteed that every single person has Kinect and can therefore do really interesting things.” An example at launch is Dead Rising 3 that allows you to shout “hey come here” to summon zombies. He said that he’s seeing games where Kinect can sense the light in the room “so if it’s darker maybe you’ll see more zombies.” There was no Netflix Netflix streaming or HBO Go when the Xbox 360 was launched, but Xbox One is designed from the ground up to enable integration with both Internet and cable and satellite programming. He said that you can instantly switch not only between online programs but between streaming video, games and broadcast programming. He described the Xbox One as “the only next generation game console that has HDMI in, so that means it will work with your existing satellite or cable box.” You can use your voice not just for gaming and online video but to change cable channels. It’s also an infrared blaster so you can use it to mute the TV or adjust the volume. We’ve come a long way since the VCR flashing “12:00″ because people couldn’t figure out how to set the clock, let alone program. Xbox Live and platform integration Hyrb described Xbox Live as a “suite of services that’s gaming and entertainment.” He said, in addition to online multiplayer gaming, “we have Xbox music and movies and television, just like iTunes. Another feature, called “smart glass” turns your iOS, Android or Windows mobile device into a second screen, he said. “That enables experiences on games that bring it to that second screen.” One example is having “in game characters call you on your phone.” That could be creepy, especially if you get a call from a zombie. One interesting feature of Xbox live is that the system can learn about how people play games so that ”when you’re playing Forza Motor Sport 5, the system learns how you drive. So, if you have a friend you play with and he or she isn’t around, the system can still drive just like your friend would drive. “My drivator now is in your game,” he said. Listen to the 11 minute interview here Summary:","output":"The Xbox One is a very special game console made by Microsoft. It has lots of cool features that make it more than just a toy for playing games. It's super fast, takes only 13 seconds to turn on, and has a special Kinect camera and microphone built-in that lets you control it with your voice and movements. It can even see your heart beating! It also works with your TV, so you can watch your favorite shows and movies. Plus, it can learn how you play games and connects with your phone or tablet for extra fun. Overall, the Xbox One is a fancy and powerful device for playing games and enjoying other entertainment."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Actor William Shatner, who is no stranger to futuristic tech, recently purchased two e-bikes for him and his wife.  I've been shopping for an e-bike now for a few weeks, and I've had my eye on the folding electric bike. I've had folding bikes in the past and love the convenience of being able to throw my bike into my car. The e -bike market is ready to go mainstream in the U.S. The price for e-bikes has come down greatly in recent months. At one time, most e-bikes with good components and proper weight were in the 3,000range. Now you can find reasonable quality e-bikes in the 1,000range. With gas prices at all-time highs, e-bikes are an attractive, low-cost option to gas efficient vehicles. E-bike owners are finding that they are great for commuting to work, as  traditional bikes can be a problem with office dress and sweat. People who use e-bikes range from commuters to casual cyclers who like a little help with hills and wind,to those who decided to save money on buying a motor bike.These are not for the serious road cycler or professional mountain biker. If you're considering all e--bike, it pays to do some research first.Cheaper e-bikes are going to be heavier and have less battery--power.Higher priced bikes will be made from lighter materials and have better batteries. Another consideration is local motor vehicle laws.For example,according to US federal law,as long as your electric bike is under 750 watts and does not go over 20 MPH then it is a bicycle and not a motor vehicle.Most consumer e--bikes in the 1,000 range don't fit the motorized vehicle description.

Answer the following question given this paragraph:   Cell Structure The cells of protists are among the most elaborate of all cells. Most protists are microscopic and unicellular, but some true multicellular forms exist. A few protists live as colonies that behave in some ways as a group of free-living cells and in other ways as a multicellular organism. Still other protists are composed of enormous, multinucleate, single cells that look like amorphous blobs of slime, or in other cases, like ferns. In fact, many protist cells are multinucleated; in some species, the nuclei are different sizes and have distinct roles in protist cell function. Single protist cells range in size from less than a micrometer to three meters in length to hectares. Protist cells may be enveloped by animal-like cell membranes or plant-like cell walls. Others are encased in glassy silica-based shells or wound with pellicles of interlocking protein strips. The pellicle functions like a flexible coat of armor, preventing the protist from being torn or pierced without compromising its range of motion.

Based on the premise \\"Erected in 1988 to celebrate Dublin's millennium as a city, it has become known to irreverent Dubliners as the Tart with the Cart. \\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"Dublin is a relatively young city. \\" is true (see options)? Options are: A). yes. B). it is not possible to tell. C). no.","output":"The statement provided indicates that Dublin celebrated its millennium as a city in 1988. This means that the year 1988 marked 1000 years since Dublin was established as a city.  To evaluate the hypothesis, \\"Dublin is a relatively young city\\" based on this information, we first need to define what \\"relatively young\\" might mean in this context. Generally, the term \\"relatively\\" is a comparison term which implies comparing with other similar entities. In this case, it's comparing Dublin with other cities. The age of any city is considered based on when it was officially established or inhabited. Cities with a history of 1000 years or more are usually considered old because they have survived for a millennium, which is a significant amount of time in human history. Thus, defining \\"young\\" and \\"old\\" for a city generally depends on the context. But if we go by generally accepted standards, 1000 years for a city to exist wouldn't fall under the category of \\"young\\". Considering the information provided earlier \\"Erected in 1988 to celebrate Dublin's millennium as a city...\\", It clearly indicates that Dublin was celebrating its millennium, which means it had existed for 1000 years from 1988. This suggests that Dublin is at least a thousand years old as of 1988. Therefore, considering all these facts, we can conclude that the city of Dublin isn't relatively young. So, the correct option regarding the hypothesis \\"Dublin is a relatively young city.\\" would be  C). No."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Several music critics favorably compared the album to Deal's work with the Pixies, among which were William Van Meter, Rob Sheffield, and Steve Kandell of Spin. Kandell and Sheffield mentioned tracks including \\"Fortunately Gone\\" as superior to songs by that group. Kandell noted Pod appealed to fans of the Pixies' \\"Gigantic\\", which was written and sung by Deal. In AllMusic, Heather Phares described Pod as a \\"vibrantly creative debut\\" that was better than the Pixies' 1990 album Bossanova, and argued that the Pixies should have recorded more of Deal's compositions.The Rough Guide to Rock's Piers Clifton and Melody Maker's Simon Reynolds viewed Pod as lacking energy in comparison to the Pixies' work. To Clifton, it was \\"plodding\\", while Reynolds felt it sounded \\"inhibited, moribund, stilted\\" and \\"never [let] it rip like the Pixies\\". Reynolds added that \\"Whenever a song gathers momentum or thrust, [the Breeders] throw in a weird bit, a gear change or an abrupt stop. They seem unhappy with the idea of simple rock exuberance.\\" Steve Taylor of The A to X of Alternative Music also found Pod inferior to music of the Pixies, but was impressed with Deal's ability to move from bass to guitar.Some reviews found Pod under-developed or insubstantial. Jon Dolan in Blender likened it to a poorly-constructed building. Robert Christgau of The Village Voice described it unfavorably as more \\"art project\\" than the work of a band, and Greg Sandow in Entertainment Weekly felt the lyrics were sometimes forced.Wif Stenger of Trouser Press called the first side \\"a bit shaky\\" but considered side 2 to be \\"damn near perfect\\". NME's Steve Lamacq described the album as \\"a tight-ish piece of tantalising rock\\", and said that listeners who found it too minimalist would soon warm to it. Karen Schoemer of The New York Times praised Pod's intelligence and originality. contains an answer for the question: What was the last name of the person who was impressed with Deal's ability to move from bass to guitar?, what is it ?

Adult contemporary music: Mainstream AC itself has evolved in a similar fashion over the years; traditional AC artists like Barbra Streisand, the Carpenters, Dionne Warwick, Barry Manilow, John Denver, and Olivia Newton-John found it harder to have major Top 40 hits as the 1980s wore on, and due to the influence of MTV, artists who were staples of the Contemporary Hit Radio format, such as Richard Marx, Michael Jackson, Bonnie Tyler, George Michael, Phil Collins, and Laura Branigan began crossing over to the AC charts with greater frequency. Collins has been described by AllMusic as \\"one of the most successful pop and adult contemporary singers of the '80s and beyond\\".

On his last day, he realizes that none of his colleagues care enough about him to say good-bye to him, instead leaving him a cake with an insult made out of icing. Driving out west in a 1956 Porsche 356 Speedster, Stone swerves to miss a cow on the highway and crashes uncontrollably into the fence of a local resident in the rural hamlet of Grady, South Carolina. The resident is local Judge Evans, who sentences him to community service at the nearby hospital as punishment rather than allow Stone pay for the fence with cash. Defeated and stranded due to the damage to his car, Ben reports to the local clinic, where Nurse Packer further humbles him by recording his community service hours by clocking him in and out, like a factory worker. Though upset, Ben makes friends with Mayor Nick Nicholson, who is also the owner of the town's cafe, and Melvin, the local mechanic tasked with repairing his car. Ben soon finds the clinic work is more laid-back than the emergency room to which he is used with simple cases, such as spots before the eyes of an elderly patient not cleaning her glasses, fishing hook impaling and even reading mail for a young illiterate couple, Kyle and Mary Owens, whose baby he later delivers.

Background: Frederick Carlton \\"Carl\\" Lewis (born July 1, 1961) is an American former track and field athlete who won nine Olympic gold medals, one Olympic silver medal, and 10 World Championships medals, including eight gold. His career spanned from 1979 to 1996, when he last won an Olympic event. He is one of only three Olympic athletes who won a gold medal in the same individual event in four consecutive Olympic Games. Lewis was a dominant sprinter and long jumper who topped the world rankings in the 100 m, 200 m and long jump events frequently from 1981 to the early 1990s. Context: Frederick Carlton Lewis was born in Birmingham, Alabama, on July 1, 1961, the son of William Lewis (1927-1987) and Evelyn nee Lawler Lewis. His mother was a hurdler on the 1951 Pan-Am team. His parents ran a local athletics club that provided a crucial influence on both Carl and his sister Carol. She became an elite long jumper, finishing 9th at the 1984 Olympics and taking bronze at the 1983 World Championships.  Lewis was initially coached by his father, who also coached other local athletes to elite status. At age 13, Lewis began competing in the long jump, and he emerged as a promising athlete while coached by Andy Dudek and Paul Minore at Willingboro High School in his hometown of Willingboro Township, New Jersey. He achieved the ranking of fourth on the all-time World Junior list of long jumpers.  Many colleges tried to recruit Lewis, and he chose to enroll at the University of Houston where Tom Tellez was coach. Tellez would thereafter remain Lewis' coach for his entire career. Days after graduating from high school in 1979, Lewis broke the high school long jump record with a leap of 8.13 m (26 ft 8 in). By the end of 1979, Lewis was ranked fifth in the world for the long jump, according to Track and Field News.  An old knee injury had flared up again at the end of the high school year, and this might have had consequences on his fitness. Lewis worked with Tellez and adapted his technique so that he was able to jump without pain, and he went on to win the 1980 National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) title with a wind-assisted jump of 8.35 m (27 ft 4 1/2 in).  Though his focus was on the long jump, he was now starting to emerge as a talent in the sprints. Comparisons were beginning to be made with Jesse Owens, who dominated sprint and long jump events in the 1930s. Lewis qualified for the American team for the 1980 Olympics in the long jump and as a member of the 4 x 100 m relay team. The Olympic boycott precluded Lewis from competing in Moscow; he instead participated in the Liberty Bell Classic in July 1980, which was an alternate meet for boycotting nations. He jumped 7.77 m (25 ft 5 3/4 in) for a bronze medal, and the American 4 x 100 m relay team won gold with a time of 38.61 s. Lewis received one of 461 Congressional Gold Medals created especially for the athletes precluded from competing in the 1980 Olympics. At year's end, Lewis was ranked 6th in the world in the long jump and 7th in the 100 m. Question: Where did he compete?. Whats the answer?","output":"Carl Lewis, a talented athlete, competed in track and field events like sprinting and long jump. He took part in competitions at his high school in Willingboro Township, New Jersey, and later at the University of Houston in college.

A: A:","output":"Erythrocytes, also known as red blood cells (RBCs), are the most abundant formed elements in the blood and play a crucial role in oxygen transport throughout the body. These red, biconcave disks are packed with an oxygen-carrying compound called hemoglobin, which is responsible for their unique function and gives them their characteristic color. Hemoglobin is a complex protein molecule composed of four polypeptide chains and four iron-containing heme groups. Each heme group binds to one oxygen molecule, enabling a single hemoglobin molecule to carry up to four molecules of oxygen. When oxygen binds to the iron atom within the heme group, the process is referred to as oxygenation, resulting in the formation of oxyhemoglobin. This bond is reversible, allowing hemoglobin to pick up oxygen in the lungs and then release it to the tissues as needed. The structure of erythrocytes, as well as their high hemoglobin content, allows for efficient oxygen transport. The biconcave disk shape provides an increased surface area to volume ratio, which maximizes the efficient exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the RBCs and their surroundings. Moreover, the flexibility of erythrocytes is another key feature that allows them to traverse through the smallest blood vessels, known as capillaries, to deliver oxygen to tissues and organs. Erythrocytes do not have a nucleus or many of the organelles typically found in other cells. This absence of cellular components creates additional space for carrying a higher volume of hemoglobin and thus more oxygen. Erythrocytes are also designed to have a relatively short lifespan (approximately 120 days) to ensure a continuous supply of fresh, functional cells to replace aged and damaged counterparts. The spleen and liver are primarily responsible for the disposal and recycling of old erythrocytes. In addition to oxygen transportation, erythrocytes also contribute to the maintenance of acid-base balance in the blood by functioning as a buffer system. Hemoglobin can bind to carbon dioxide (a waste product of cellular metabolism) in a process called carbamino formation, producing carbaminohemoglobin. This reaction not only helps remove carbon dioxide from the tissues but also aids in the regulation of blood pH levels. In conclusion, erythrocytes are vital components of blood that not only give blood its red color but are crucial for oxygen transport throughout the body. Their unique red, biconcave disk shape and the presence of hemoglobin allow them to efficiently deliver oxygen to tissues and organs while maintaining acid-base balance and pH regulation within the circulatory system."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

And he did not mince words when discussing the company's problems.      He said that the recent performance was \\"poor\\" and that \\"the numbers don't lie.\\" Sales have fallen lately and the stock has lagged the broader market.      To tackle this problem, McDonald's is reorganizing its international operations and plans to franchise more of its restaurants. It wants to have 90% of its locations franchised by 2018, up from 81% currently.      McDonald's hopes to save 300 million annually by the end of 2017 thanks to all the restructuring and plans to be more disciplined about spending.      But what Easterbrook really wants to change is the quality of the food and stale brand image.      Get ready for more new offerings like its sirloin burger and artisan grilled chicken sandwich. The company also is testing beef and chicken sandwiches with flavors such as pico guacamole and jalapeno.      Related: McDonald's is giving 90,000 workers a raise      McDonald's (MCD) faces tough competition from rapidly growing burger chains like Shake Shack (SHAK), Five Guys and Smashburger that are increasingly popular with younger customers.      Many consumers feel that burgers from these and other chains, despite being more expensive, taste better and are made from higher quality ingredients.      Consumers are also embracing so-called fast casual food from Chipotle (CMG) (which McDonald's used to own a stake in) and Panera (PNRA).      Related: Chipotle is now GMO-free      And there is a full blown breakfast war in fast food as well. Yum Brands (YUM)-owned Taco Bell is gunning for the Egg McMuffin crowd.      Is the plan enough? Investors don't seem convinced. The stock fell Monday.      Easterbrook stressed that McDonald's has to innovate more.      He promised that the company would return \\"excitement\\" to the brand and used the phrase \\"modern, progressive burger company\\" several times to describe the image McDonald's wants to convey.      But at the end of the day, it all comes down to the food. No amount of restructuring can help if the company doesn't make tasty burgers and fries.      \\"It is customers that decide if we succeed. The message is clear. We are not on our game,\\" he said.      During a conference call with reporters, Easterbrook said there is \\"enthusiastic testing\\" about new menu items and changes to how customers order.      On the menu side, Easterbrook said the company is experimenting with new TasteCrafted sandwiches in some California locations. Customers can choose a beef or chicken patty on one of three types of rolls and four different flavors.      Easterbrook said McDonald's may also soon feature mobile ordering, self-order kiosks or other types of technology so customers won't just be forced to go to the counter or drive-through window.      \\"We are adding choice, whether it's on service or the menu for our customers,\\" he said.      Still, it remains to be seen how any of this will work. One issue that Easterbrook is trying to tackle is the complexity of the menu. There are too many offerings.      Customization may be something consumers want. But it could also make the ordering process even more complicated. ||||| McDonald's is reorganizing its business, selling restaurants to franchisees and giving billions back to shareholders as part of a much-anticipated turnaround plan unveiled by the company's new CEO.      Many industry observers had hoped to see the struggling burger giant take more risks on matters that customers care about: menu choices, food quality and speed.      \\"Everything that he talked about seemed sensible but it seems to lack that calculated risk that they talked about on the last earnings call,\\" said R.J. Hottovy, who follows restaurant companies at Morningstar. \\"I don't look at anything they've discussed today as truly groundbreaking, and more of just catching up with a lot of things their peers have done.\\"      Caption TRIBUNE TRIBUNE See more galleries Caption Market segments See more galleries Related Galleries RESTART GALLERY      The changes unveiled Monday, just nine weeks into CEO Steve Easterbrook's tenure, were largely behind-the-scenes efforts aimed at keeping investors happy while buying the company time to fix its menu, long a source of frustration for diners and franchisees. McDonald's, which cut dozens of jobs at its Oak Brook headquarters in recent months, did not say how many additional jobs it might eliminate.      Increasingly, millennials and other consumers are bypassing McDonald's in favor of fast-growing competitors such as Chipotle, Panera Bread and Shake Shack that serve foods perceived as premium, fresher or healthier.      \\"No business or brand has a divine right to succeed,\\" Easterbrook said near the start of a 23-minute video released Monday outlining some of the goals. \\"The reality is our recent performance has been poor. The numbers don't lie.\\"      Comparable sales, or sales at restaurants open at least 13 months, have fallen globally in four consecutive quarters and are down six straight quarters in the United States, with no sign of quick rebounds.      The CEO was frank in his assessment and said he expects pressures to persist through at least the first half of 2015. Easterbrook, who aims to turn McDonald's into \\"a modern, progressive burger company,\\" said the company has \\"scale and reach like no other company,\\" yet has become cumbersome and slow.      \\"We're not on our game,\\" Easterbrook said.      There were few new details Monday on changes consumers will notice, though the CEO mentioned U.S. efforts such as artisan grilled chicken and sirloin burgers and an emphasis on value to come this summer. Easterbrook also pulled back from his predecessor Don Thompson's lofty expectations for Create Your Taste order kiosks. Thompson had predicted the kiosks, which allow customers to choose everything from guacamole to garlic sauce, would show up at 2,000 U.S. restaurants by the end of 2015, up from 30.      Instead, Easterbrook emphasized the opportunity the U.S. could have with TasteCrafted, which lets diner choose from several predetermined topping combinations. He also announced McDonald's is testing delivery from 88 restaurants in New York City through Postmates, a service that already delivers for chains such as Chipotle and Starbucks.      McDonald's plans to sell some 3,500 company-owned restaurants to franchisees restaurants by the end of 2018, up from a prior target of refranchising at least 1,500 restaurants by 2016. The new plan means that it will have about 90 percent of its restaurants run by franchisees, up from 81 percent currently.      Having fewer company-run restaurants frees the corporation to spend more time on branding and other overall efforts rather than being as concerned with day-to-day operations at individual stores. It also shifts some risk to franchisees, who pay percentages of their sales to McDonald's. Plus, it would trim the number of restaurant workers directly employed by McDonald's even as the company plans to increase starting wages at the U.S. restaurants it operates, bowing to growing union pressures under the Fight for 15 banner.      The company announced a new structure with four segments: The U.S. and three international segments.      Starting July 1, the new segments will be run by existing McDonald's executives. Mike Andres will continue to serve as president of the U.S. business, a role he took on last fall. Doug Goare, who is president of McDonald's Europe, will become president of International Lead Markets, a group of well-established markets including Australia, Canada, France, Germany and the U.K.      The U.S. market accounts for more than 40 percent of McDonald's operating income, followed by International Lead Markets, which accounts for about 40 percent of operating income. High-growth markets, including China and Russia, and foundational markets, including countries such as South Africa, each account for about 10 percent of operating income.      McDonald's said the refranchising, organizational shake-up and being more disciplined about spending should cut costs by about 300 million a year. Much of the savings should be realized by the end of 2017.      McDonald's also plans to return 8 billion to 9 billion to shareholders this year and aims to reach the top end of its goal to return 18 billion to 20 billion to shareholders from 2014 to 2016.      Howard Penney, a restaurant analyst at Hedgeye Risk Management in Connecticut, said Monday's announcement left him feeling unsatisfied. He said refranchising and stock buybacks were not a big deal because McDonald's generates a lot of cash.      \\"We were not given a lot of detail about how he is going to fix the operations,\\" Penney said. \\"Shuffling the decks inside the organization is not a strategy.\\"      Standard & Poor's lowered its ratings on McDonald's to A- from A and said the outlook is stable. McDonald's said it would issue more debt, taking advantage of low interest rates, to help fund its efforts.      So far this year, McDonald's has overhauled everything from its ingredients to its employee compensation to its advertising as it tries to boost sales around the world.      McDonald's issues include a long string of sales declines amid fresh competition from fast-casual chains such as Chipotle. It faces economic pressure in major markets such as Europe as well as union-backed protests as some workers seek higher wages and improved working conditions.      On Monday, the union-backed Fight for 15 group said thousands of cooks and cashiers would participate in what it said would be the biggest protest ever to hit McDonald's annual shareholder meeting, set for May 21 at its Oak Brook campus. Sriram Madhusoodanan from Corporate Accountability International, which speaks out against McDonald's marketing efforts, meanwhile said he saw \\"no substantive plan\\" from Easterbrook on how he plans to address the brand's lost trust and credibility.      McDonald's has said it expects its sales weakness to continue in the near term. It already forecast a decline in global comparable sales for April. The April sales results are due Friday. ||||| S&P downgraded fast food giant McDonald's credit rating to \\"A-\\" with a stable outlook on Monday.      \\"The return to shareholders of about 8.5 billion this year will necessitate higher leverage than we forecast and represents a more aggressive shift toward shareholders returns than we previously assumed,\\" according to a release.      As part of McDonald's plan to turnaround its business, the fast food giant plans to accelerate refranchising and overhaul its organizational structure to juice company results and modernize the fast food giant's struggling operations, CEO Steve Easterbook said Monday.      McDonald's plans to increase its franchise mix to 90 percent of its locations by 2018 from the current 81 percent as the company embarks on an \\"urgent need to reset this business,\\" Easterbrook said in a video Monday, warning that progress will be \\"bumpy and uneven.\\" The restaurant is also reorganizing its structure into four segments: U.S., international lead markets, high growth markets and foundational markets. ||||| Write a summary.","output":"McDonald's CEO, Steve Easterbrook, unveiled a turnaround plan to tackle the company's recent performance, which he described as \\"poor\\".

In the sentence \\"Drop him from the Republican ticket,\\" the word \\"drop\\" means to remove someone from a list or position, specifically from being a candidate for a political party.

In his Physics, book IV, Aristotle offered numerous arguments against the void: for example, that motion through a medium which offered no impediment could continue ad infinitum, there being no reason that something would come to rest anywhere in particular. Although Lucretius argued for the existence of vacuum in the first century BC and Hero of Alexandria tried unsuccessfully to create an artificial vacuum in the first century AD, it was European scholars such as Roger Bacon, Blasius of Parma and Walter Burley in the 13th and 14th century who focused considerable attention on these issues.

Democratic Gov. Pat Quinn, under fierce attack for his plan to boost income taxes and for his handling of a prison release program, finds himself in a dead heat against surging state Comptroller Dan Hynes.      State Treasurer Alexi Giannoulias, the Democratic front-runner in the race for President Barack Obama’s old Senate seat, has seen his lead in polls narrow in recent days as he has taken criticism from former Chicago Inspector General David Hoffman and Chicago Urban League President Cheryle Jackson about his oversight of a family-owned bank and his handling of the Bright Start college savings program.      At the local level, Todd Stroger, the powerful Democratic president of the Cook County Board, who has come under fire for his hiring practices and his support for a sales tax increase, has fallen significantly behind his primary challengers in new polling.      “Democrats are starting to realize that every single Democrat in the country is vulnerable now. It’s a very angry electorate, a very volatile electorate,” said Jerry Morrison, political director of the state Service Employees International Union, which has endorsed Quinn and Giannoulias.      “It’s been brewing for some time,” said Illinois House Republican Leader Tom Cross. “I think it’s as intense here as it’s been [in Massachusetts].”      As in Massachusetts, where Republican Scott Brown recently won a stunning Senate victory, polling shows Illinois voters expressing deep dissatisfaction with the direction of the state and the country, with a survey late last year from the Paul Simon Public Policy Institute showing that just 23 percent of voters think the state is headed in the right direction and that just 44 percent think the country is headed in the right direction.      That sentiment confronts not only the Democrats caught in competitive primaries but also Rep. Mark Kirk, the front-runner for the Republican Senate nomination.      “The anger is palpable. People are frustrated — and they don’t know who to take it out on,” said Eric Adelstein, an Illinois-based Democratic strategist. “[People are] just very cynical — and right now the job approvals are low for everybody.”      But for all the comparisons with the Massachusetts race — a nationalized affair that focused heavily on the health care debate — the Illinois contests remain distinctly state-focused, with both parties’ contenders for governor and Senate homing in on corruption in the state capital and a devastating state budget deficit that now tops 11 billion.      Steve Brown, a senior aide to Democratic House Speaker Michael Madigan, predicted that voters Tuesday would base their decisions on how they saw lawmakers addressing the state’s problems.      “It’s a different situation than you have in other states,” said Brown. “I think [voters] are more focused on the performance of individual legislators.”      All of this takes place against the backdrop of the scandal involving former Democratic Gov. Rod Blagojevich, who, a little more than a year ago, was impeached after charges that he sought to sell Obama’s Senate seat to the highest bidder.      “For far too long, Illinois has been ruled by the hair,” says an ad for gubernatorial contender Andy McKenna, a former state GOP chairman, showing a Blagojevich-like mop of hair covering the dome of the state Capitol. “The cure must come from the outside.” ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"Widespread voter anger and unrest are confronting the Illinois political establishment as the state approaches its first-in-the-nation primaries.

An email can reveal personal information if you aren't careful. Choose from:  (1). Yes.  (2). It's impossible to say.  (3). No. The answer is:","output":"(1). Yes. It is accurate to infer that an email can reveal personal information if you aren't careful. When you send an email using your personal email account, it usually contains your name, email address, and sometimes even additional contact information, depending on how you have set up your email signature. This data can be easily accessed by the recipient of the email, making it less secure when you want to send messages anonymously. To send an anonymous text or message, it is necessary to take some precautions that help conceal your identity so that the recipient cannot trace the message back to you. Here are some steps to help you send an anonymous text: 1. Create a new, anonymous email account: There are numerous email providers such as Gmail, Yahoo, and Outlook that offer free email accounts. Set up a new account that does not include any of your personal information. Make sure not to use your real name or any identifying details when choosing your username and email address for this account. 2. Use an anonymous texting app or website: There are several apps and online platforms that allow you to send anonymous texts, like Textem, TextForFree, and Text'em. These services typically don't require you to provide any personal information, and the recipient will not be able to view your identity. Be mindful of the app's privacy policy and terms of service, as some may store your messages or share them with third parties. 3. Enable a VPN: A Virtual Private Network (VPN) helps to protect your privacy and anonymity by hiding your true IP address. This will make it more difficult for the recipient, or anyone else, to trace the text message back to you. There are both free and paid VPN options available, so choose one that meets your needs and ensures a secure connection. 4. Be cautious with the content of your message: While these steps can help you maintain anonymity, it's essential to be aware of the content you share in your anonymous text. Refrain from including personal, identifiable information that could compromise your anonymity. Also, note that sending threatening, harassing, or illegal messages can lead to legal consequences, even if you are attempting to stay anonymous. By following these measures, you can minimize the risk of revealing your personal information when sending an anonymous text. Always be cautious and respectful in your actions, as anonymity does not shield you from potential consequences related to inappropriate or harmful messages."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a hypothesis: They only offer upscale rooms at a premium price. Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","output":"No, it is not possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis. The premise states that they have rooms and houses to fit many tastes and budgets, from the lavish to the thrifty. This means that they offer a diverse range of accommodations, including both high-end, luxurious options and more budget-friendly, economical choices. Therefore, the hypothesis contradicts the premise since it claims that they only offer upscale rooms at a premium price.  To offer a more detailed explanation, let's break down the premise and hypothesis and analyze the discrepancies between them. Premise: 1. They offer rooms and houses to accommodate various tastes and budgets. 2. They provide a range of options, from the lavish to the thrifty. Hypothesis: 1. They only offer upscale rooms. 2. These rooms come at a premium price. In the premise, it is clearly indicated that there is a range of accommodations to suit different preferences and financial constraints. The company or service in question aims to cater to a wide audience by providing options across a spectrum of luxury and affordability. On the other hand, the hypothesis states that the company exclusively offers upscale rooms at premium prices. This assumes that only luxurious and expensive accommodations are available, which contradicts the premise's claim that they cater to various tastes and budgets. According to the premise, options from different levels of luxury and price ranges should be accessible, while the hypothesis excludes the presence of more affordable and less luxurious rooms. In conclusion, the premise and hypothesis are in conflict, and it is not possible to deduce that the hypothesis is true if the premise is accurate. They present two opposite scenarios: one with a diverse range of accommodations, and the other with only a specific type of luxurious rooms. As a result, accepting the premise as true would invalidate the hypothesis."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Write an article based on this \\"A University of Nottingham lecturer who criticised the arrest of a student under the Terrorism Act has left his job \\"by mutual agreement\\".\\"","output":"Title: Lecturer Exits University of Nottingham Amidst Dispute Over Student's Terrorism Act Arrest Introduction A lecturer from the University of Nottingham in the United Kingdom has recently left his job by mutual agreement, following disagreement over the arrest of a university student under the Terrorism Act. The lecturer's criticism of the arrest raised questions on the issue of academic freedom and how universities handle national security concerns. Step 1: Explain the background of the incident The incident began when a University of Nottingham student was arrested on campus under the Terrorism Act, a piece of legislation that gives law enforcement additional powers when dealing with terrorism-related offenses. The student was suspected of being involved in activities that led the authorities to believe they posed a threat to national security. Step 2: Introduce the lecturer's stance As news of the arrest became public, the unnamed lecturer criticized the university's role in the arrest and questioned the legitimacy of the Terrorism Act being applied to the student. These criticisms were heard and discussed throughout the academic community at the university and beyond. Step 3: Present the university's response to the criticism In response to the lecturer's criticism, the University of Nottingham expressed concern over the severity of the issue and claimed to have fully cooperated with law enforcement to protect their students, staff, and broader community. Additionally, the university emphasized the importance of adhering to national security guidelines and the role they play in upholding these standards. Step 4: Discuss the lecturer's departure As the situation escalated, the lecturer and the University of Nottingham reached a mutual agreement for the lecturer to leave his position at the university. The specific reasons for the departure have not been disclosed, but the decision has led to a wider conversation about academic freedom and the responsibilities of educational institutions when dealing with national security concerns. Step 5: Analyze the implications of this incident The departure of this lecturer from the University of Nottingham has brought attention to several critical questions related to the relationship between academic freedom and national security. Educational institutions are often faced with the dilemma of balancing their dedication to fostering open discussion and research, with the legal responsibility to protect their communities from potential threats. This incident serves as a reminder of the importance of academic freedom in a democratic society, as well as the need for universities to be vigilant and responsive to security concerns. It highlights the fundamental and ongoing debate about the role of universities in contemporary society, and whether the pursuit of knowledge should occasionally be curtailed in the name of security. Conclusion As we reflect on the departure of the University of Nottingham lecturer, we are reminded of the delicate balance between academic freedom and national security responsibilities. This case offers a glimpse into the complexities that educational institutions face in today's increasingly interconnected world. It invites us to ponder on the role of universities in shaping our societies and safeguarding academic freedom while respecting the need for national security measures."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Could you please translate this to English?","output":"Certainly, the text translates to English as follows: Nevertheless, we must acknowledge that the lack of transparency, and the citizens' opinion on this matter, continues to remain a significant issue, particularly within the Commission. This sentence suggests an ongoing issue or problem in a certain Commission. The issue highlighted here is the lack of transparency. Transparency, in this context, refers to openness, accountability, and honesty in the Commission's operations. When an organization or sector is transparent, it is easy for others, including citizens, to see what actions are performed within that organization/sector.  The speaker’s remarks reveal that not only does this lack of transparency exist, but it is also recognized and potentially criticized by citizens. There is a continuous reference to the problem, suggesting that it hasn't been adequately addressed or solved yet, hence it is still being mentioned and it remains a significant issue.  The public, or \\"the citizens\\", have an opinion on this matter that seems to contribute to its significance. The phrase \\"the citizens' opinion on this matter\\" implies that public sentiment or opinion may be unhappy with or critical of the existing state of transparency within the Commission. Therefore, the speaker seems to be suggesting that more work needs to be done to improve transparency and to address public concerns about it in the Commission. Notably, this sentence does not provide details about the specific Commission, so it's impossible to discuss the particular implications or reasons for this lack of transparency. However, in general, lack of transparency in any organization or body could lead to various problems, including decreased trust, accountability issues, and inefficient operations among others.

In collectivist societies, like Japan and Korea, where a person's identity is more tied closely to other groups, suicides can be seen as the ultimate way to rebuild or reclean your image, if it changes.\\" \\"I think there is something paradoxical in it. On one hand, some see it as a way of maintaining status and restoring honor to you and the people you represent, but the pressure from that group could contribute to you considering suicide.\\" Roh was under investigation for corruption and some believe the pressures he felt just became too great. \\"Roh had come to power as a human rights lawyer, as an uneducated outsider pledging to clean up Korean politics, so it was particularly hard on him to have what he stood for and the reality of what happened under his administration. I think that was particularly hard for him to take,\\" David King, director of the Korean Studies Institute at the University of Southern California told CNN. Watch more on the rise and fall of Roh. In a suicide note to his family, Roh described his life as \\"difficult\\" and was sorry for making \\"too many people suffer.\\" Roh had said he was ashamed about the scandal and in the first round of questioning, he said he was losing face and that he was disappointing his supporters. In South Korea, Roh is the latest and highest profile of recent suicides of public figures. In late 2008, two South Korean actors took their lives. Police cited malicious online rumors as a possible cause for the suicide of Cho Jin-sil in October 2008. The blogs and chat rooms had speculated that she had been pressuring fellow actor Ahn Jae-hwan to repay a debt before he took his own life in September 2008.  Video: How South Korean continue mourning ». High-profile suicides can make for lurid headlines, which Dr Paul Yip, director of the Centre for Suicide Research and Prevention at the University of Hong Kong, believes are far from helpful in combating suicide rates. \\"Common in Asia is to sensationalize suicides, especially among celebrities. Often the local or national media publish lots of details of how it was done. The media (in Hong Kong) has got better in their responsible reporting,\\" he said. \\"Whenever famous people kill themselves there is an effect on those people who are most vulnerable from a similar age group -- we see this in Taiwan, South Korea and Japan and China, \\" said Yip. \\"People at risk can see Roh's death as an example and say, 'Well if he can do it, so can I'. Neither Roh nor any of the high-profile people who have committed suicide would have thought about this affect. There are a number of complex issues. There isn't just one that leads someone to take their life.\\" Copycat deaths are a worry for Yip, and Colucci agreed that there can be lots of meaning in the method of a suicide, which people may be encouraged to follow. \\"The way that Roh died is similar to some of the methods used in Japan, which is interesting. It really suggests it's about the people wanting to relieve the burden they feel they are on others. For young people, it can be really connected to ideas of identity. For many, they feel it's the last thing they have control over,\\" said Colucci. Watch CNN's report on Japan's suicide forest. Yip advised the South Korean Ministry of Health during Roh's administration to help them devise a new approach to dealing with mental health issues and the problem of suicide. \\"It is sad that Roh, whose government really did a lot to tackle the issue, should have done this. Last year a mental health act was passed by the South Korean government, as it recognized that more steps needed to be taken,\\" said Yip. While there are distinct differences between the societies and traditions of Japan, Korea and Hong Kong, Yip was at least encouraged that the Chinese Special Administrative Region has seen a decline in the number of suicide cases since its peak in 2003 of some 1,200 to around 9000 . A key element has been breaking though the taboo of talking about mental health issues, one that Yip believed was common across Asia. \\"They've been stigmatized, and very common that it would not be talked about, especially if there is not a good mental health support system in place. Ten years ago in Hong Kong, people didn't want to talk about it.\\" However, Yip is well aware of the link between suicide rates and economic change, which many have cited as a reason for suicide rates increasing. \\"The rate generally goes up more in Asian countries than the west when there is an economic downturn. For an age group like Roh's, suicide can seem like a very traditional, if extreme way to solve problems. The problems at first are economic, but make people feel great shame or disgrace. There is a large sense of pride in middle-age men and working people.\\" Making it acceptable to talk about problems, making people feel connected to their community and having a support system in place were methods Yip believed has helped to reduce those at risk. But it was not just something that charities or governments can work on, Yip said: \\"We have to reach out to the main concern groups, it's a multi-layered approach.\\" Highlights:","output":"1. South Korea is shocked by the suicide of former president Roh Moo-Hyun. 2. South Korea has one of the highest suicide rates among economically advanced countries. 3. Many suicides are caused by mental disorders, but social, cultural, and economic pressures play a big role too. 4.

It has been a great threat for the poultry industry all around the world. In this report, we successfully produced infectious pseudotyped pNL4-3-Luc-R 2 E 2 (HIV-Luc) viruses with the HN and F envelope proteins of NDV. Further investigation revealed the cytoplasmic domains of HN and F, especially HN, plays a significant role in the infection efficiency of these pseudotyped HIV-Luc viruses. Replacement of, or direct fusion to the cytoplasmic domain of the HN protein by that of vesicular stomatitis virus G (VSV-G) could greatly enhance or destroy the infective potential of HN and F-pseudotyped (NDVpseudotyped) HIV-Luc virus. We further established a novel neutralization assay to evaluate neutralizing antibodies against NDV with the NDV-pseudotyped HIV-Luc viruses. Comparative neutralization data indicate that the results determined by using the NDV-pseudotyped HIV-Luc viruses are as reliable as those by the conventional virus-neutralization assay (VN test) with native NDV. Moreover, the results show that the novel neutralization assay is more sensitive than the VN test.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Voters in two major California cities overwhelmingly approved cuts to retirement benefits for city workers in what supporters said was a mandate that may lead to similar ballot initiatives in other states and cities that are struggling with mounting pension obligations.      Supporters had a simple message to voters in San Diego and San Jose: Pensions for city workers are unaffordable and more generous than many private companies offer, forcing libraries to slash hours and potholes to go unfilled.      \\"The public is frustrated,\\" said San Diego Councilman Carl DeMaio, a Republican who staked his mayoral bid on the pension measure and advanced to a November runoff in Tuesday's election to lead the nation's eighth-largest city.      In San Diego, 66 percent voted in favor of Proposition B, while 34 percent were opposed. Nearly 97 percent of precincts were tallied by early Wednesday.      The landslide was even bigger in San Jose, the nation's 10th-largest city. With all precincts counted, 70 percent were in favor of Measure B and 30 percent were opposed.      \\"The voters get it, they understand what needs to be done,\\" said San Jose Mayor Chuck Reed, a Democrat who has called pensions his highest priority.      Shrinking tax revenues during the recession are also responsible for service cuts in San Diego and San Jose, but pensions were an easy target. San Diego's payments to the city's retirement fund soared from 43 million in 1999 to 231.2 million this year, equal to 20 percent of the city's general fund budget, which pays for day-to-day operations.      As the pension payments grew, San Diego's 1.3 million residents saw roads deteriorate and libraries and recreation centers cut hours. For a while, some fire stations had to share engines and trucks. The city has cut its workforce 14 percent to 10,100 employees since Sanders took office in 2005.      San Jose's pension payments jumped from 73 million in 2001 to 245 million this year, equal to 27 percent of its general fund budget. Voters there approved construction bonds at the beginning of the last decade, but four new libraries and a police station have never opened because the city cannot afford to operate them. The city of 960,000 cut its workforce 27 percent to 5,400 over the last 10 years.      Tuesday's votes set the stage for potentially lengthy legal challenges by public employee unions. The measures are unusual because they address pensions for current employees, not just new hires.      Opponents say the measures deprive workers of benefits they were counting on when they got hired. Some workers decided against potentially more lucrative jobs with private companies, figuring their retirement was relatively safe.      Those arguments failed to resonate with voters.      \\"A lot of employees are disheartened,\\" said Yolanda Cruz, president of the San Jose Municipal Employees Federation, who called the outcome disappointing. \\"We've been made the full problem of what's been going on.\\"      The ballot measures differ on specifics. San Diego's imposes a six-year freeze on pay levels used to determine pension benefits unless a two-thirds majority of the City Council votes to override it. It also puts new hires, except for police officers, into 401(k)-style plans.      More than 100,000 residents signed petitions to put the San Diego measure on the ballot.      Under San Jose's measure, current workers have to pay up to 16 percent of their salaries to keep their retirement plan or accept more modest benefits. New hires would get less generous benefits.      Reed joined an 8-3 City Council majority to put the measure on the ballot. He said after Tuesday's vote that he expected other cities in financial binds to pursue similar measures.      \\"It's novel but it's certainly not radical,\\" he said. \\"Mayors across the country are very interested. We're at the leading edge but we're not alone.\\" ||||| LOS ANGELES — As Wisconsin residents voted on Tuesday not to recall Gov. Scott Walker — who has become an enemy of labor unions nationwide — two California cities dealt blows of their own to organized labor.      In San Diego and San Jose, voters overwhelmingly approved ballot initiatives designed to help balance ailing municipal budgets by cutting retirement benefits for city workers.      Around 70 percent of San Jose voters favored the pension measure, while 66 percent of San Diego residents supported a similar measure.      \\"This is really important to our taxpayers,\\" Mayor Chuck Reed of San Jose, said Tuesday night. \\"We’ll get control over these skyrocketing retirement costs and be able to provide the services they are paying for.\\"      Statewide, voters also remained very closely divided on a 1-per-pack tax on cigarettes, which would be the first increase in the cigarette tax here in 14 years. Proceeds from the tax would not go to state coffers, but would instead finance cancer research.      The tax remained too close to call on Wednesday morning, according to The Associated Press, although opponents of the measure appeared to cling to a razor-thin lead with all precincts reporting.      Antismoking advocates, who promoted the tax as the best way to reduce smoking rates, were outspent nearly four to one. Their opponents, financed largely by the tobacco industry, spent almost 47 million in advertisements to defeat the measure.      Public employee unions, meanwhile, had fought hard against the two pension reform initiatives.      The San Diego Municipal Employees Association brought an unsuccessful legal challenge in an effort to keep the measure off the ballot, and union leaders said they would continue to challenge the new pension plan in court. The measure in San Jose will probably face a legal challenge as well.      Michael Zucchet, general manager of the union, said that it had already negotiated pension reforms with the city, and that the plan imposed by the ballot initiative would not save San Diego money. Its proponents, he said, were motivated largely by politics.      “This initiative, in and of itself, saves not one penny,” Mr. Zucchet said.      But the mayors of both cities pushed the pension reforms hard, arguing that changes to city worker pensions were essential to keep municipal budgets in the black.      Jon Coupal, president of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Association, said he hoped the initiatives would provide models for other cities and for the state government, where pension reform efforts have stalled. \\"The appetite for pension reform in California is huge,\\" Mr. Coupal said.      Tuesday also offered the first widespread test of the state’s new primary system, in which the top two vote-getters move on to a runoff, regardless of party affiliation.      One of the most heavily financed races pit two sitting Democratic representatives, colleagues in the House for 15 years, against each other to represent the San Fernando Valley: Brad Sherman won with 42 percent of the vote, and Howard L. Berman had 32 percent. They will face each other again in the November runoff. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"In a move that signals a broader shift in addressing increasing pension obligations, voters in two major Californian cities, San Diego and San Jose, have overwhelmingly approved cuts to city workers' retirement benefits.

In San Diego, Proposition B was favored by 66% of voters, and in San Jose, Measure B was backed by 70%. These measures mainly aim to freeze pay levels and shift new hires to 401(k)-style plans.

Here is a hypothesis: I particularly note the pride of Woody Allen, an influential Jew.   Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","output":"To assess this logically, let's break it down step-by-step: Step 1: Identify the key terms in the premise and hypothesis. Premise: Pride in Jews as a whole. Hypothesis: Pride of Woody Allen, an influential Jew. Step 2: Establish the relationship between the key terms. The relationship between the terms is that Woody Allen is a part of the larger group of Jews. Step 3: Determine if the premise supports the hypothesis. The premise states there is pride in Jews as a whole. This implies that Jews, in general, have a sense of pride. Since Woody Allen is a Jew, he is a part of this group. Step 4: Decide if the premise, being true, leads to the hypothesis being true. If it is true that pride exists in Jews as a whole, it is possible that Woody Allen, being an influential Jew, may also possess pride. Conclusion: If the premise is true, it is possible that the hypothesis is also true, as Woody Allen is part of the larger group of Jews.

Does \\"Rome's officials and priests reclined in order of precedence alongside and ate the meat; lesser citizens may have had to provide their own.\\" correctly answer the question of Who ate the meat of the sacrifice during the after sacrifice  banquet?","output":"The statement \\"Rome's officials and priests reclined in order of precedence alongside and ate the meat; lesser citizens may have had to provide their own\\" partially answers the question of who ate the meat of the sacrifice during the after-sacrifice banquet. The sentence describes that Rome's officials and priests participated in the consumption of the sacrificial meat, but there is more to the story. In ancient Rome, sacrifices were an important aspect of religious and community life that were meant to honor the gods and provide a symbolic connection between the divine and human realms. When a sacrifice took place, it was often followed by a communal meal or banquet which was meant to be a shared experience for all participants. During these banquets, the sacrificial meat was typically distributed among various social groups in a hierarchical order, reflecting the social order and values of Roman society. As the statement suggests, high-ranking officials and priests, along with their families, were given priority in the consumption of the sacrificial meat. These individuals would recline in places of honor during the banquet and enjoy the choicest portions of the offerings. However, the communal meal was intended to involve not only the elite but also the general populace of Rome. Lower-ranking citizens, freedmen, slaves, and even the poor would also participate in the after-sacrifice banquet. Although they might have had to bring their own food or drink, they were also allowed to partake in the sacrificial meat, albeit in smaller or perhaps less choice portions. The distribution of sacrificial meat during this banquet reinforced social and religious bonds among the Roman population. By sharing the meat of a sacrifice, Romans believed that they were sharing a meal with the gods, thus ensuring the gods' favor and continued protection. In conclusion, the statement provided partially answers the question, as it accounts for the role of officials and priests in eating the sacrificial meat but doesn't fully emphasize the communal nature of the event. In ancient Roman sacrifices, the meat was consumed by high-ranking officials, priests, and their families, as well as lesser citizens and other members of the population, each according to their social status. This hierarchical consumption of sacrificial meat reflected the values and social structures of Roman society and reinforced religious bonds among its members."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: What is the answer for the question: What is the full name of King Krishnadevaraya court jester? from the following article ?  The Kannada poets and scholars of the empire produced important writings supporting the Vaishnava Bhakti movement heralded by the Haridasas (devotees of Vishnu), Brahminical and Veerashaiva (Lingayatism) literature. The Haridasa poets celebrated their devotion through songs called Devaranama (lyrical poems) in the native meters of Sangatya (quatrain), Suladi (beat based), Ugabhoga (melody based) and Mundige (cryptic). Their inspirations were the teachings of Madhvacharya and Vyasatirtha. Purandaradasa and Kanakadasa are considered the foremost among many Dasas (devotees) by virtue of their immense contribution. Kumara Vyasa, the most notable of Brahmin scholars wrote Gadugina Bharata, a translation of the epic Mahabharata. This work marks a transition of Kannada literature from old Kannada to modern Kannada. Chamarasa was a famous Veerashaiva scholar and poet who had many debates with Vaishnava scholars in the court of Devaraya II. His Prabhulinga Leele, later translated into Telugu and Tamil, was a eulogy of Saint Allama Prabhu (the saint was considered an incarnation of Lord Ganapathi while Parvati took the form of a princess of Banavasi).At this peak of Telugu literature, the most famous writing in the Prabandha style was Manucharitamu. King Krishnadevaraya was an accomplished Telugu scholar and wrote the celebrated Amuktamalyada. Amuktamalyada (\\"One who wears and gives away garlands\\") narrates the story of the wedding of the god Vishnu to Andal, the Tamil Alvar saint poet and the daughter of Periyalvar at Srirangam. In his court were eight famous scholars regarded as the pillars (Ashtadiggajas) of the literary assembly. The most famous among them were Allasani Peddana who held the honorific Andhrakavitapitamaha (lit, \\"father of Telugu poetry\\") and Tenali Ramakrishna, the court jester who authored several notable works.

To do this, we divide both sides of the equation by -15: (-15*q) / (-15) = -15 / (-15) Step 3: Simplify the equation. On the left side of the equation, the -15 in the numerator and the -15 in the denominator cancel each other out, leaving just the variable q: q = -15 / (-15) On the right side of the equation, -15 divided by -15 is 1: q = 1 So the solution to the equation -21*q + 6*q = -15 is q = 1."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The jurors also requested dinner ordered in as they deliberated a little longer before heading home for the night.      \\"Another day of waiting,\\" Brodsky said. \\"He's been in jail three-and-a-half years, so it's not like he hasn't thought about this day, if it is today.\\"      It was.

FILE - In this May 8, 2009 file photo, former Bolingbrook, Ill., police sergeant Drew Peterson leaves the Will County Courthouse in Joliet, Ill., after his arraignment on charges of first-degree murder... (Associated Press)      Peterson, 58, faces a maximum 60-year prison term when sentenced. Illinois has no death penalty.      The prosecution built its case almost exclusively on circumstantial and hearsay evidence, including testimony about what Peterson's wives had told friends and acquaintances before the one died and the other disappeared. The verdict was a vindication for Will County prosecutors, who gambled by putting on such a case and then committed numerous stumbles during testimony that drew angry scoldings from the judge.      Over the course of the investigation and prosecution, Peterson had seemingly taunted authorities, joking on talk shows and even suggesting a \\"Win a Date With Drew\\" contest. His notoriety even inspired a TV movie starring Rob Lowe.      A neighbor found Kathleen Savio's body on March 1, 2004, face down in a dry bathtub of her suburban home outside Chicago. Her thick black hair was blood-soaked and she had a 2-inch gash on the back of her head.      The drowning death of the 40-year-old aspiring nurse was initially deemed an accident _ a freak slip in the tub. After Peterson's fourth wife, 23-year-old Stacy Peterson, went missing in 2007 was Savio's body exhumed, re-examined and her death reclassified as a homicide.      The 12 jurors, who raised eyebrows by donning different color-coordinated clothes each day of testimony, deliberated for XXdays/hours before reaching a decision. The seven men and five women included a poet, a letter carrier and a man who said his favorite TV show was \\"Criminal Minds.\\"      Peterson had divorced Savio a year before her death. His motive for killing her, prosecutors said, was fear that a pending settlement, which included their 300,000 home, would wipe him out financially.      Fascination nationwide with the former Bolingbrook police sergeant arose from speculation he sought to parlay three decades of law enforcement expertise into getting away with murder.      Prosecutors suspect he killed his fourth wife because she could finger him for Savio's death. Stacy Peterson's family hoped a conviction in Savio's murder could lead to charges against Drew Peterson in Stacy's disappearance.      Jurors weren't supposed to link the fourth wife's disappearance to the third's death. Prosecutors were prohibited from even telling jurors Stacy Peterson is presumed dead or that her husband is the lone suspect in her disappearance. He says she ran off with another man and is still alive.      Prosecutors faced enormous hurdles.      They had no physical evidence tying Peterson to Savio's death and no witnesses placing him at the scene. They were forced to rely on typically barred hearsay _ statements Savio made to others before she died and that Stacy Peterson made before she vanished. In 2008, Illinois passed a law tailored to Peterson's case, dubbed \\"Drew's Law,\\" permitting hearsay at trials in rare circumstances.      The hearsay included friend Kristen Anderson testifying that Savio told her Peterson once warned her at knife point, \\"I could kill you and make it look like an accident.\\" Savio so feared for her life that she kept a knife under her mattress.      And Stacy Peterson's pastor, Neil Schori, testified she told him that her husband got up from bed and left their house in the middle of the night around the time of Savio's death. Crying and hugging her knees, she said Drew Peterson later coached her on how to lie to police.      There was damning testimony not based on hearsay.      A former co-worker of Peterson's, Jeff Pachter, testified that Peterson offered him 25,000 to hire a hit man to kill Savio, though he never followed through. After Savio was found dead, Peterson told him, \\"That favor I asked you _ I don't need it anymore.\\"      Prosecutors had to establish the most basic fact for a murder trial: that there was actually a murder.      Pathologists testified for the defense that Savio's wounds indicated an accident. But equally well-respected pathologists for the state said it was impossible for a single fall to cause both the wound on the back of her head and bruises on the front of her body.      In their three-day case, Peterson's lawyers endeavored to cast doubt on the reliability of key witnesses. They accused Savio's sister, Susan Doman, of jazzing up her testimony to profit from a movie and book deal.      The last defense witness was Peterson's and Savio's 19-year-old son, Thomas Peterson. The polite, well-spoken college student cut a sympathetic figure, telling jurors he has never believed his father killed his mom.      Both sides blundered parts of their presentations.      Prosecutors angered the judge several times by broaching subjects previously ruled inadmissible. And as they sought to blunt the credibility of hearsay evidence, the defense ended up prompting their own witness to emphasize that Stacy Peterson was convinced her husband did kill Savio.      Peterson could still win release someday. His lawyers have said they may appeal all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court on grounds Illinois' hearsay law is unconstitutional.      Some legal experts worried about the precedent a conviction at a trial dependent on hearsay would set, saying it could open the floodgates for the admissibility of such evidence in Illinois and elsewhere.      ___      Follow Michael Tarm at http://www.twitter.com/mtarm ||||| Summary:","output":"Drew Peterson, a former Illinois police officer, was found guilty of murdering his third wife, Kathleen Savio, after a trial that relied heavily on circumstantial and hearsay evidence.

Usage: In the example, the task has three components - Context, Sentence, and Character. The Context is 'None', meaning there's no additional information provided about the character or the sentence. The sentence is 'Billy, John, and David went to the little league field', and the Character is 'Billy'. The Character is one of the individuals mentioned in the Sentence. Part #2: Identifying the action or job of the given character from the sentence. Usage: Again referring to the example, Billy's action, along with John and David, is 'went to the little league field'. This part comes directly from understanding the sentence. Part #3: Deriving the emotion expressed by the character from their action in the sentence. Usage: The given sample doesn't explicitly state any emotions, and without any context information, we can conclude that it is difficult to infer any emotions. Part #4: Use the Context to help derive the Character's emotion, if the Context is provided. Usage: Since no context is provided in the example, we cannot utilize this part of the task. However, if the context was something like 'Billy has been wanting to play in the little league for months now', we could infer that Billy might be excited or happy. Part #5: Recognizing that sometimes there might be zero emotion expressed in the sentence. Usage: In our example, there seems to be zero emotion expressed by Billy, following Part #3 and considering the lack of context. No emotions are clearly stated or implied. Part #6: If no emotion can be derived from the context and sentence, return 'None'. Usage: In the given sample, there's no emotion that can be related to Billy's action. Therefore, we return 'None' as per this instruction."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Coleco Industries Inc., a once high-flying toy maker whose stock peaked at 65 a share in the early 1980s, filed a Chapter 11 reorganization plan that provides just 1.125 cents a share for common stockholders. Under the plan, unsecured creditors, who are owed about 430 million, would receive about 92 million, or 21 cents for each dollar they are owed. In addition, they will receive stock in the reorganized company, which will be named Ranger Industries Inc. After these payments, about 225,000 will be available for the 20 million common shares outstanding. The Avon, Conn., company's stock hit a high in 1983 after it unveiled its Adam home computer, but the product was plagued with glitches and the company's fortunes plunged. But Coleco bounced back with the introduction of the Cabbage Patch dolls, whose sales hit 600 million in 1985. But as the craze died, Coleco failed to come up with another winner and filed for bankruptcy-law protection in July 1988. The plan was filed jointly with unsecured creditors in federal bankruptcy court in New York and must be approved by the court.  After reading the above, is \\"Toys\\" the correct answer to the question \\"Which products resulted in stock growth for Coleco in the 1980s?\\"?

Is scrapping old 500 and 1000 rupees notes and releasing new 500 and 2000 rupees notes a permanent solution for eradication of black money? How would the newly introduced rs 2000 notes not contribute to laundering and black money? Multi-choice problem: Are these two questions inquiring about the same information? Pick from:  A). no.  B). yes.","output":"B). yes. Both questions revolve around the impact of scrapping old 500 and 1000 rupees notes and the introduction of new 500 and 2000 rupees notes on the issue of black money and money laundering in India. These measures are part of an initiative called demonetization, which aimed to eradicate black money and corruption in the country. However, it is essential to explain each aspect in detail to understand if this initiative can offer a permanent solution. Scrapping old 500 and 1000 rupees notes and demonetization was an effort to address the circulation of black money, which is the income often obtained illegally or without paying the appropriate taxes. These notes accounted for about 86% of the cash in circulation at the time of demonetization, in November 2016. By invalidating these high-value banknotes, the Indian government aimed to flush out black money holders, reduce corruption, and curb the financing of terrorism and other illegal activities. Although demonetization affected the country's economy in the short term by causing cash shortages and exacerbating deflationary trends, it prompted more citizens and businesses to adopt digital payment methods and conduct banking transactions, thereby increasing transparency within the financial system. However, saying that demonetization is a permanent solution for eradicating black money may not be entirely accurate. While it did force many black money holders to deposit their illicit funds in banks, black money generation usually depends on deeper structural issues related to tax and regulatory systems. As a result, addressing these underlying issues is essential for a long-term solution to the problem of black money. Moreover, the tax system's complexity needs simplification to encourage compliance and reduce the incentive to generate black money. The introduction of new banknotes, specifically the 2000 rupees notes, has raised concerns about their potential contribution to money laundering and black money accumulation. While the newly introduced notes were designed with enhanced security features to nullify the risk of forgery, there is still the possibility of these high-value notes being used to store unaccounted-for wealth and conduct illegal transactions. However, some measures have been taken to mitigate the risk of money laundering and black money generation through the new notes. One such measure is the increased use of digital payments in the economy following demonetization. As digital transactions become more prevalent, the reliance on physical cash decreases, affecting the generation and circulation of black money. Nevertheless, it cannot guarantee complete eradication or prevention of these problems. In conclusion, though the scrapping of old 500 and 1000 rupees notes and the introduction of new 500 and 2000 rupees notes provided a temporary solution to the black money issue, achieving permanent eradication would depend on addressing underlying structural problems like tax and regulatory systems. Additionally, regardless of the enhanced security features, the newly introduced 2000 rupees notes may still contribute to money laundering and black money if not well-regulated."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: High lake had a lot of fresh and salt water mixing, therefore presented layers of stratified water.The water was poor in nutrients.Low lake had no such problems and it was a very abundant and prolific fishing spot.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which lake had less anoxia?  Hint: Water stratification is when water masses with different properties - salinity (halocline), oxygenation (chemocline), density (pycnocline), temperature (thermocline) - form layers that act as barriers to water mixing which could lead to anoxia or euxinia.[1] These layers are normally arranged according to density, with the least dense water masses sitting above the more dense layers.  Water stratification also creates barriers to nutrient mixing between layers. This can affect the primary production in an area by limiting photosynthetic processes. When nutrients from the benthos cannot travel up into the photic zone, phytoplankton may be limited by nutrient availability. Lower primary production also leads to lower net productivity in waters.[2] The answer is:","output":"Low Lake had less anoxia. Based on the given information, High Lake had layers of stratified water due to the mixing of fresh and saltwater, which created barriers to water mixing. This stratification could lead to anoxia or euxinia, as these layers prevent proper oxygen circulation and create zones with low concentrations of dissolved oxygen. Additionally, the stratification hindered the mixing of nutrients, causing the water to be nutrient-poor. Low nutrient availability in High Lake could lead to reduced primary production and ultimately lower overall productivity. On the other hand, Low Lake did not have the issues related to water stratification, and it was described as an abundant and prolific fishing spot. Without stratification, Low Lake would allow for better water circulation and improved oxygen distribution throughout the water column. Moreover, the absence of stratification in Low Lake facilitates the mixing of nutrients between layers, ensuring sufficient nutrient availability for primary production and supporting a healthy and diverse aquatic ecosystem. Therefore, based on the information provided, it can be concluded that Low Lake had less anoxia, as it didn't have the water stratification issues present in High Lake, and thus had better overall water circulation and nutrient mixing to support a thriving ecosystem."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

By the year 2050 there may be 12.5 billion . There are a lot of people to feed. We need more and more food. One way to produce more food is growing stronger plants. For thousands of years, farmers have made plants better. Every season, they pick the best plants for the next season. It works very slowly. Since 1983, scientists have been able to change plants more quickly by changing their genetic  material. Foods from plants grown in this way are called genetically modified  foods, or GM foods By changing the genetic material of a plant, it is possible to make new plants. They make plants which are strong against plant diseases. They can also help in our diseases; a kind of rice is being prepared , for example , which stops people becoming blind. Rich countries produce GM foods because they are easy to grow and bring in more money. Poor countries are interested in them because they help produce more food. GM plants are not natural. No one knows how good or bad they are,. Making GM foods is only one way of feeding people in 2050. There are strong feelings against them, because they are unnatural.

The equivalent of 6.75 Empire State Buildings placed on top of one another. Biologists at Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, California tagged eight of the whales off San Nicholas Island in southern California. They are interested in whether the whales display unusual behaviour when they hear sonar emitted from ships.","output":"Title: A Glimpse into the Depths: Cuvier's Beaked Whales Show Remarkable Diving Capabilities Introduction The ocean covers more than 70% of our planet, representing an enormous and largely unexplored playground for a variety of marine life. Among these aquatic species lies the Cuvier’s beaked whale (Ziphius cavirostris), a mysterious creature known for its deep-diving capabilities and ability to stay submerged for extended periods of time. Just recently, researchers at Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla, California, were able to record a truly remarkable diving feat by one of these whales, raising questions about the impact of sonar emissions on their behavior and the unknown depths of their world. A Record-Breaking Dive In a groundbreaking study conducted off the coast of San Nicholas Island in southern California, biologists at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography succeeded in tagging eight Cuvier's beaked whales. One of these ocean giants managed to astonish the scientists with an incredible dive of 9,816 feet (2,992 meters) below the waves, staying submerged for an astounding 38 minutes. To put this in perspective, imagine stacking 6.75 Empire State Buildings on top of one another - that's the equivalent depth at which this whale plunged. Cuvier’s beaked whales: The Deep-Sea Champions Cuvier's beaked whales are not new to the limelight when it comes to deep diving and their unparalleled ability to hold their breath underwater. These whales hold the record for the longest and deepest dives among all marine mammals, often diving to depths greater than 6,500 feet (2,000 meters) and staying submerged for more than 30 minutes during hunts. Their preferential habitat is the mesopelagic zone, which encompasses the waters between 660 to 3,300 feet (200-1,000 meters) in depth, where they feed mainly on squid and deep-sea fish. Understanding the Impact of Sonar Emissions on Whale Behavior Given their unique diving capabilities, Cuvier's beaked whales have attracted significant research attention. Particularly, scientists are keen to scrutinize any possible behavioral changes these whales may display in response to sonar emitted from ships. Sonar, or sound navigation and ranging, is utilized by the military and other vessels to detect underwater objects and navigate efficiently in the vast ocean. However, these powerful sound waves may be altering the behavior of deep-diving marine life like the Cuvier's beaked whales, causing them to surface too quickly and potentially harming or even killing them in the process. By tagging and observing these whales, the biologists at Scripps Institution of Oceanography aim to gather more in-depth knowledge about how the whales might be reacting to these sonar emissions. This information can be crucial in establishing precautionary measures that could help to prevent any undue harm to these magnificent creatures, ensuring their continued existence and illustrating how humans can share and protect the ocean with minimal negative impact. Conclusion The remarkable dive of the Cuvier's beaked whale recorded by Scripps Institution of Oceanography scientists is yet another testament to the vast potential and mysteries that lie within the depths of our oceans. Not only does it shed light on the impressive abilities of this species, but it also raises important questions about how human activities, such as sonar usage, may be impacting their lives. In comprehending these unknown depths, we unlock the potential for humans and whales to co-exist harmoniously, nurturing a future in which we better understand and respect the world that lies beneath the waves."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article: If you have a private backyard or a nude beach nearby, let your buns soak up a little sun on a warm day. The sun naturally helps dry up excess oil. Make sure you are using a sunscreen with at least SPF 30, though, to protect your skin from the UV radiation.  Make sure to apply a non-comedogenic sunscreen beforehand to avoid sunburn. Only use this method once in a while, and only after the acne heals. Too much sun exposure may actually cause acne to darken or get worse. Some acne medication may cause sensitivity to the sun. Talk to your doctor if you are currently using any prescription or over-the-counter treatments. Crush up four or five aspirin pills. Make sure there is no coating on the outside of the pills. Combine with one tablespoon lukewarm water and either a dollop of honey or plain yogurt, depending on your preference.  Apply a thin layer over the entire surface of your buttocks. Allow the mask to dry before rinsing it off. Follow the treatment up with a non-comedogenic moisturizer to prevent further irritation. Do not try this treatment if you are allergic to aspirin. Always talk to your doctor before you use aspirin on a child or teenager's skin, as aspirin may be linked to Reye's syndrome in those age groups. Fresh lemon juice and apple cider vinegar diluted in water can be used to treat pimples. If your pimples have open sores, however, this can be painful. Leave on for about 5-10 minutes and rinse it off thoroughly with cool water and a gentle body wash.  Be very careful with this treatment. A small amount of lemon juice or apple cider vinegar diluted in water can help dry out a zit. Applying an acid straight to your pimples, though, can be drying and may actually cause more acne. Add a few drops of honey to your diluted solution for its antibacterial and soothing effects. Tea tree and coconut oil are great antibacterial and antifungal oils that can be rubbed on the problem areas to help heal acne. Though this won't directly help heal your pimples, it will cause immediate relief from painful pimples. To make a homemade ice pack, wrap a handful of ice in a washcloth and apply it to the pimple or inflamed area for 15-20 minutes. You can also use a commercial ice pack. Just be sure there is a cloth barrier between the pack and your skin to prevent damage from the cold.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize the following: Touch is a universal language, and the very first one for humans. If a loved one is going through a tough time, offer your touch and give this person a big hug. It may sound simple but for someone who is distressed, afraid or upset, warm touch can be soothing and even calm cardiovascular stress. As a result of a lowered stress response, research shows that hugging your friend can reduce her susceptibility to sickness.  Ask first to be sure hugging is an appropriate way to comfort your friend; some people do not like such physical gestures. Hold your friend close and rub her back. If she cries, let her cry into you. If you notice that your loved one seems to be trying hard to hold back what she is feeling, tell her it’s okay to show emotion. Many people feel guilty about expressing negative emotions. Others fear that they will be judged for not “keeping it together”. Tell your friend that you want her to feel whatever she’s feeling, and that you won’t judge her for it.  Say something like \\"It looks like you are having a hard time right now, and I want you to know that I'm here to listen if you want to vent\\" or \\"If you need to cry, you go right ahead\\". Psychologists insist that experiencing negative emotions is just as important as feeling positive states. Negative feelings teach us so much about the natural ups and downs of life. Therefore, expressing negative feelings, as opposed to suppressing them, can be instrumental to overall mental health. Your friend may want to lounge around all day watching reality TV or thumbing through gossip magazines. Your friend may want to talk about what’s bothering her, or she may want to talk about everything but that. She may want to go shopping, or simply take a nap. Plot out a few hours of distraction-free time to focus entirely on your hurting friend. Don’t come with a specific agenda; just be present. Your friend may not feel up to doing anything or may feel overwhelmed about making any decisions. But, it's smart to have a few ideas ready in case she wants to do something. If you know a certain thing tends to bring a smile to your friend’s face, bring it to cheer her up. Understand that she may not feel any better because of this, but she will recognize that you are trying to make her feel better and likely appreciate the gesture. For example, you might bring over a comfy blanket for your friend to curl up under, a pleasant distraction in the form of a boxed set of your favorite DVDs (if she feels like watching), or a half-gallon of her favorite ice cream to share as she vents to you. If your friend is grieving or upset, she may not have had the energy to tidy up the house, pick up groceries, or take her dog out for a walk. Step forward to complete chores or errands like these, and you could remove additional stress for your friend. In addition, think practically and bring necessities that your friend and/or family may need during this time of need.  Or, you can call over and ask \\"I know with all that's going on, you probably haven't had time to get groceries or household items. What can I bring you from the store?\\" List items might include disposable plates and napkins if they will be entertaining visitors as well as facial tissues and herbal tea like chamomile.","output":"Touch is a way we can show people we care about them. When people are sad or upset, giving them a hug can help them feel better. Hugs can make them feel safe and even help them not get sick. Always ask if it's okay to hug someone first, because some people don't like it. Let them know it's okay to feel sad and show their feelings. Spend time with your sad friend and do what they want to do, like watching a movie or taking a nap. Bring something that makes them happy, like a comfy blanket or their favorite ice cream. Help them with things they need to do, like cleaning or getting groceries.

So, as you can imagine, I was pretty damn excited when the in-laws presented me with an Urban Spa voucher for the Urban Indulgence package: one hour hot stone Lomi Lomi massage followed by a Heavenly Spa Facial - two hours on indulgent bliss, for Christmas. I had never had a hot stone massage before so was very much looking forward to this, if nothing else out of curiosity about what is involved. Whenever you see pictures advertising a hot stone massage, the beautiful model always has a bunch of largish stones on her back so I wasn't sure whether it was more an acupressure experience where they left the stones strategically placed on the back to work their magic or whether it was an actual massage.  Turns out that it is an actual massage. I requested a firm massage as my back has really been giving me issues. Carrying 15kgs of Crazy Kid or 9kgs of Kiki (or 26kgs of double babies) really isn't too good for the back so it had been causing me problems for a couple of months. My therapist (the lovely Kristy) gave me an expertly firm massage and used a small, smooth hot stone, along with her hands, to perform the massage. It was quite a unique experience as one minute I could sense that she was using her hands to do the massage then then next I'd get a sweep of hotness as the stone was run over me. It really was a delightful sensory experience. As my back was a problem area, Kristy spent 30 minutes just on that then the other 30 minutes was spent on the rest of my body. I could feel myself drifting in and out of consciousness throughout the massage. One really special thing about this massage was that the massage table was heated. Such a small touch, but one that was greatly appreciated (although it was a great contributor to my lack of consciousness!). Question: Who ate the cake?

Swindon chairman Lee Power confirmed the club have changed their structure following the appointment of David Flitcroft as manager on 5 June. Former Tottenham and Aston Villa boss Sherwood arrived at Swindon in November to oversee transfer activity. However, Swindon won just seven of their 31 games after his appointment  and were relegated from League One. Sherwood's exit follows Power vowing to change the way Swindon works day-to-day in pursuit of promotion back to League One at the first attempt. Power told BBC Wiltshire last month the club will take a \\"more traditional route\\" in recruitment, meaning former Barnsley and Bury manager Flitcroft will have sole control over transfers. Flitcroft, who has brought Ben Futcher in from Bury as his assistant manager, will benefit from one of the biggest budgets in League Two, but said he still had to get \\"value for money\\" from his players. \\"Budget doesn't guarantee anything. There have been some big-budget teams that haven't got out of the league in the last few years,\\" he continued. \\"We're competing against League One. Even though Swindon is a big draw, we're in League Two, and I think that could potentially be the Achilles heel to signing players. \\"But there will be plenty of players that do want to come and it's been very encouraging so far.\\" Swindon have offered new contracts to captain Nathan Thompson, Yaser Kasim, Raphael Rossi-Branco, Jermaine Hylton and Jon Obika, but are yet to make any new signings this summer.","output":"Swindon Town Football Club undergoes structural changes, with the exit of former Director of Football Tim Sherwood and manager David Flitcroft taking sole control over transfers in pursuit of promotion back to League One."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Movie title: The Gruffalo Movie plot: The protagonist of The Gruffalo is a mouse. The story of the mouse's walk through the woods unfolds in two phases; in both, the mouse uses cunning to evade danger.The mouse goes for a walk in the forest and on his way encounters several dangerous animals (a fox, an owl, and a snake). Each of these animals, clearly intent on eating the mouse, invites him back to their home for a meal. The cunning mouse declines each offer. To dissuade further advances, he tells each animal that he is going to dine with his friend, a gruffalo, whose favourite food happens to be the relevant animal. The mouse describes the outlandish features of the gruffalo's monstrous anatomy. Frightened that the gruffalo might eat them, each animal flees. The mouse gloats to himself; he knows the gruffalo is a fictional monster:Silly old fox/owl/snake, doesn't he know? there's no such thing as a gruffalo!After he has seen off the last animal, however, the mouse is shocked to encounter a real gruffalo, bearlike and hideous and with all the frightening features the mouse thought that he was inventing. True to his reputation, the gruffalo threatens to eat the mouse, but again the mouse is cunning. He tells the gruffalo that he, the mouse, is the scariest animal in the forest. Laughing, the gruffalo agrees to follow the mouse as he demonstrates how everyone is afraid of him. The two walk through the forest, encountering in turn the animals that had earlier menaced the mouse. Each is terrified by the sight of the pair and runs off, and each time the gruffalo becomes more impressed with the mouse's apparent toughness. Exploiting this, the mouse threatens to eat the gruffalo, who himself flees.The story is based on a traditional Chinese folk tale of a fox that borrows the terror of a tiger. Donaldson was unable to think of rhymes for \\"tiger\\" so invented one for \\"know\\" instead. The answer is:","output":"The three predators that want to eat the mouse in the movie \\"The Gruffalo\\" are a fox, an owl, and a snake. The movie's plot unfolds in such a way that the mouse, while on a walk through the forest, encounters each of these dangerous animals one by one.  The fox, eager to have the mouse for his meal, tries to lure the mouse back to his place by extending an invite. But, the quick-thinking and cunning mouse skillfully declines the fox's offer. To safeguard himself, the mouse concocts a tale about his made-up friend, the gruffalo, who, incidentally, enjoys dining on foxes. Next, the mouse meets the owl, who also sees the small creature as a potential meal and invites him to his home. Again, the mouse utilizes his cleverness to decline the invite, using the same gruffalo story that scared off the fox, mentioning that one of the gruffalo's favourite foods is an owl. Lastly, the mouse encounters a snake. The snake, like the fox and the owl before him, wants to eat the mouse and invites him back to his place. Sticking to his narrative, the mouse tells the snake about his monstrous \\"friend\\", the gruffalo, whose favourite dish, he says, is snake meat. The story pays homage to the traditional Chinese folktale of a fox that uses the terror of the tiger to his advantage. In this adaptation, the mouse uses the imaginary threat of the gruffalo to scare away each predator he meets, showing his cunningness and intelligence until he comes face-to-face with an actual gruffalo, setting the stage for another round of wit and cunning.  It's a delightful narrative that highlights the intelligence and adaptability of the protagonist, despite the physical superiority of his adversaries, making for a compelling and engaging story that can be appreciated by viewers of all ages. As for investing in this film proposal, it's important to consider both the story's universal appeal and its moral lessons about courage and intellect.

The demonstration is interrupted when men arrive to transfer one of the prisoners to another jail. As he's being led away, prisoner Jason Brett grabs the pistols, shoots the sheriff, and escapes, pretending that Farrell was his partner. Convinced that Farrell was involved in the escape, the townspeople arrest the innocent gun salesman. In the coming days, Brett initiates a campaign of robberies and cold blooded murder, with regular guns being no match for his Colt .45 pistols. Four months later, Farrell is released from jail due to a lack of evidence. The new sheriff offers him a letter clearing him of the charges if he reveals Brett's whereabouts. Reasserting his innocence, Farrell vows to go after Brett to retrieve his guns. Farrell tracks his prey into Texas and comes across a band of Indians whom Brett has killed to provide cover for a stagecoach robbery. The only survivor of the attack, Walking Bear, tells Steve about Brett's plan. As the stagecoach approaches, Steve jumps onto the stage from a rock outcropping just in time to fight off the attack by Brett's gang with his own set of Colt .45s.

Task: Explain the connection between oil, dinosaur carcasses, and energy sources. Step 1: Identify the sources of oil Oil is formed from the remains of ancient marine plants and animals, such as algae and zooplankton. These remains gradually became buried under layers of sediment, where they were eventually subjected to heat and pressure, leading to the formation of oil. Step 2: Understand the role of dinosaur carcasses in fossil fuels formation Dinosaur carcasses are also a source of fossil fuels, specifically petroleum and natural gas. Similar to the process mentioned above, dinosaur remains were buried under layers of sediment and subjected to heat and pressure, resulting in the creation of fossil fuels. However, it is crucial to mention that not all fossil fuels come solely from dinosaurs, as plant materials also played a significant role. Step 3: Demonstrate the connection between fossil fuels and energy sources Both oil and the fossil fuels formed from dinosaur carcasses are hydrocarbons, meaning they contain carbon and hydrogen atoms. When these hydrocarbons are burned, they release chemical energy in the form of heat and light. This energy can then be harnessed for various purposes, such as generating electricity, powering vehicles, and producing heat for homes and industries. Step 4: Summarize the connection In conclusion, oil and the fossil fuels derived from dinosaur carcasses are connected through their shared origin and ability to provide energy. Both substances are formed from organic matter that has been subjected to heat and pressure, resulting in the creation of hydrocarbons. These hydrocarbons can then be burned to release energy, making them valuable sources of power for various applications."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Step 2: Examine potential reactions among vegans. - Some vegans might become conflicted about their choices, while others might cling to veganism, but broaden their ethical considerations or seek alternative food sources. Step 3: Predict possible outcomes for veganism. - While plant intelligence might cause debates and some individuals to alter their dietary choices, it is unlikely to lead to the full abandonment of veganism as a moral stance. Conclusion: If there was indisputable evidence of plant intelligence, veganism might be re-evaluated by some individuals, but it's unlikely to disappear completely as a moral stance. Question 3: Do these questions have the same meaning? Option 1: No - The first question involves a career change for a specific individual, while the second question pertains to the potential impact of plant intelligence on veganism.

The odour of a familiar human apparently lingers like perfume in the animal's brain - where it triggers an instinctive emotional response, research published yesterday reveals. Our scent acts on a part of the canine brain associated with reward and the strongest reactions are produced by humans that pets know best, say scientists in America. Gregory Berns, of Emory University in Atlanta, said: 'While we might expect that dogs should be highly tuned to the smell of other dogs, it seems that the \\"reward response\\" is reserved for their humans. 'When humans smell the perfume or cologne of someone they love, they may have an immediate, emotional reaction that's not necessarily cognitive. 'Our experiment may be showing the same process in dogs. But since dogs are so much more olfactory  than humans, their responses would likely be even more powerful than the ones we might have. 'It's one thing when you come home and your dog sees you and jumps on you and licks you and knows that good things are about to happen. 'In our experiment, however, the scent donors were not physically present. Why do animals avoid pylons? Because they emit terrifying flashes of light that are INVISIBLE to humans. Dolphins use sponges to protect their sensitive noses while foraging for food on the sea floor 'That means the canine brain responses were being triggered by something distant in space and time. It shows that dogs' brains have these mental representations of us that persist when we're not there.' The university's experiment - the first of its type - involved 12 dogs of various breeds who underwent brain scans while five different scents were placed in front of them. The scent samples came from the subject itself, a dog the subject had never met, a dog that lived in the subject's household, a human the dog had never met, and a human that lived in the subject's household. The familiar human scent samples were taken from someone else... Question: According to the passage, a dog will be most interested in  _  .

Stories or narratives have been shared in every culture as a means of entertainment, education, cultural preservation and instilling moral values. Crucial elements of stories and storytelling include plot, characters and narrative point of view. The term 'storytelling' is used in a narrow sense to refer specifically to oral storytelling and also in a looser sense to refer to techniques used in other media to unfold or disclose the narrative of a story.  - An anecdote is a brief, revealing account of an individual person or an incident. Often humorous, anecdotes differ from jokes because their primary purpose is not simply to provoke laughter, but to reveal a truth more general than the brief tale itself, such as to characterize a person by delineating a specific quirk or trait, to communicate an abstract idea about a person, place, or thing through the concrete details of a short narrative. An anecdote is \\"a story with a point.\\"  - A short story is a piece of prose fiction that can be read in one sitting. Emerging from earlier oral storytelling traditions in the 17th century, the short story has grown to encompass a body of work so diverse as to defy easy characterization. At its most prototypical the short story features a small cast of named characters, and focuses on a self-contained incident with the intent of evoking a \\"single effect\\" or mood. In doing so, short stories make use of plot, resonance, and other dynamic components to a far greater degree than is typical of an anecdote, yet to a far lesser degree than a novel. While the short story is largely distinct from the novel, authors of both generally draw from a common pool of literary techniques.  - Oscar Fingal O'Flahertie Wills Wilde (16 October 185430 November 1900) was an Irish playwright, novelist, essayist, and poet. After writing in different forms throughout the 1880s, he became one of London's most popular playwrights in the early 1890s. He is remembered for his epigrams, his novel \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\", his plays, as well as the circumstances of his imprisonment and early death.  - The Picture of Dorian Gray is a philosophical novel by Oscar Wilde, first published complete in the July 1890 issue of \\"Lippincott's Monthly Magazine\\". The magazine's editor feared the story was indecent, and without Wilde's knowledge, deleted roughly five hundred words before publication. Despite that censorship, \\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\" offended the moral sensibilities of British book reviewers, some of whom said that Oscar Wilde merited prosecution for violating the laws guarding the public morality. In response, Wilde aggressively defended his novel and art in correspondence with the British press, although he personally made excisions of some of the most controversial material when revising and lengthening the story for book publication the following year.  - \`\` The Canterville Ghost '' is a short story by Oscar Wilde , widely adapted for the screen and stage . It was the first of Wilde 's stories to be published . The story is about a family who moves to a castle haunted by the ghost of a dead nobleman , who killed his wife and was starved to death by his wife 's brothers .  - A novel is a long narrative, normally in prose, which describes fictional characters and events, usually in the form of a sequential story.  - Prose is a form of language that exhibits a grammatical structure and a natural flow of speech, rather than a rhythmic structure as in traditional poetry. Where the common unit of verse is based on meter or rhyme, the common unit of prose is purely grammatical, such as a sentence or paragraph.  - Fiction is the classification for any story or universe derived from imaginationin other words, not based strictly on history or fact. Fiction can be expressed in a variety of formats, including writings, live performances, films, television programs, animations, video games, and role-playing games, though the term originally and most commonly refers to the narrative forms of literature (see \\"literary\\" fiction), including the novel, novella, short story, and play. Fiction constitutes an act of creative invention, so that faithfulness to reality is not typically assumed; in other words, fiction is not expected to present only characters who are actual people or descriptions that are factually true. The context of fiction is generally open to interpretation, due to fiction's freedom from any necessary embedding in reality; however, some fictional works are claimed to be, or marketed as, historically or factually accurate, complicating the traditional distinction between fiction and non-fiction. Fiction is a classification or category, rather than a specific mode or genre, unless used in a narrower sense as a synonym for a particular literary fiction form.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Carved into the side of mountains, these footpaths offer mesmerising views of a spectacular landscape. Some of the footpaths on Jianmenguan Mountain in Jiange County, southwest China's Sichuan Province, date from nearly 1,000 years ago from China's Three Kingdoms Period. Over the years, these footpaths have been extended and a more modern addition is a protruding skywalk. Tourists can enjoy spectacular views from the Jianmenguan mountain in Jiange County, southwest China's Sichuan Province. A maze of different footpaths traverse the mountain, winding in and out of the cliff faces and offering amazing views of the surroundings. Some of the routes are more 'safe' than others, with ledges to hold on to and steps for comfort, others, as right, are more perilous. The routes are favoured with tourists, and offer the perfect opportunity to snap some photographs of nature at it's most beautiful. And the location is steeped in history. There are 72 peaks in the mountain range, and only one through road. The Battle of Jianmen Pass was fought between the communists and the nationalists during the Chinese Civil War in the post World War II era and resulted in communist victory in 1949. This is one of the more futuristic walkways on Jianmenguan mountain in Jiange County, where visitors get unrivalled views. The paths are favoured with tourists, and offer the perfect opportunity to snap some photographs of nature at it's most beautiful. Whoever controlled this 1.5mile long stretch of the road controlled the gateway of Sichuan, and the nationalists had built an elaborate system of bunkers in the area to strengthen its defense against the expected communist invasion. The communists managed to capture over 300 prisoners-of-wars and had all the remaining people killed in the fierce battle, and more importantly, the taking of Jianmen Pass secured the passage for the communists to invade deeper into the heart of Sichuan. Much history is contained within the mountain, where steps can be traced from the great battle between the communists and nationalists. Wooden railings give some comfort to visitors to the range, but they will still have to be wary of hitting their heads. Summarize the highlights of this article.","output":"Jianmenguan Mountain in Jiange County, China has footpaths that are almost 1,000 years old.

The new technique uses sonic stimulation to excite the neurons in the thalamus, the brain’s central hub for processing information.      A 25-year-old man recovering from a coma has made remarkable progress following a treatment at UCLA to jump-start his brain using ultrasound. The technique uses sonic stimulation to excite the neurons in the thalamus, an egg-shaped structure that serves as the brain’s central hub for processing information.      “It’s almost as if we were jump-starting the neurons back into function,” said Martin Monti, the study’s lead author and a UCLA associate professor of psychology and neurosurgery. “Until now, the only way to achieve this was a risky surgical procedure known as deep brain stimulation, in which electrodes are implanted directly inside the thalamus,” he said. “Our approach directly targets the thalamus but is noninvasive.”      Monti said the researchers expected the positive result, but he cautioned that the procedure requires further study on additional patients before they determine whether it could be used consistently to help other people recovering from comas.      “It is possible that we were just very lucky and happened to have stimulated the patient just as he was spontaneously recovering,” Monti said.      A report on the treatment is published in the journal Brain Stimulation. This is the first time the approach has been used to treat severe brain injury.      Martin Monti/UCLA The researchers targeted the thalamus with low-intensity focused ultrasound pulsation.      The technique, called low-intensity focused ultrasound pulsation, was pioneered by Alexander Bystritsky, a UCLA professor of psychiatry and biobehavioral sciences in the Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behavior and a co-author of the study. Bystritsky is also a founder of Brainsonix, a Sherman Oaks, California-based company that provided the device the researchers used in the study.      That device, about the size of a coffee cup saucer, creates a small sphere of acoustic energy that can be aimed at different regions of the brain to excite brain tissue. For the new study, researchers placed it by the side of the man’s head and activated it 10 times for 30 seconds each, in a 10-minute period.      Monti said the device is safe because it emits only a small amount of energy — less than a conventional Doppler ultrasound.      Before the procedure began, the man showed only minimal signs of being conscious and of understanding speech — for example, he could perform small, limited movements when asked. By the day after the treatment, his responses had improved measurably. Three days later, the patient had regained full consciousness and full language comprehension, and he could reliably communicate by nodding his head “yes” or shaking his head “no.” He even made a fist-bump gesture to say goodbye to one of his doctors.      “The changes were remarkable,” Monti said.      The technique targets the thalamus because, in people whose mental function is deeply impaired after a coma, thalamus performance is typically diminished. And medications that are commonly prescribed to people who are coming out of a coma target the thalamus only indirectly.      Under the direction of Paul Vespa, a UCLA professor of neurology and neurosurgery at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, the researchers plan to test the procedure on several more people beginning this fall at the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center. Those tests will be conducted in partnership with the UCLA Brain Injury Research Center and funded in part by the Dana Foundation and the Tiny Blue Dot Foundation.      If the technology helps other people recovering from coma, Monti said, it could eventually be used to build a portable device — perhaps incorporated into a helmet — as a low-cost way to help “wake up” patients, perhaps even those who are in a vegetative or minimally conscious state. Currently, there is almost no effective treatment for such patients, he said.      The study’s other co-authors are Vespa, who holds UCLA’s Gary L. Brinderson Family Chair in Neurocritical Care and is director of neurocritical care at the Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center; Caroline Schnakers, a UCLA neurosurgery researcher; and Alexander Korb, a Semel Institute researcher. ||||| A new discovery by medical researchers shows a significantly better recovery might be possible for future coma patients.      A team at UCLA recently used ultrasound to “jump-start” the brain of a 25-year-old man after a coma. The doctors called his improvements “remarkable,” which might mark this as a big breakthrough. In their paper on the procedure in the academic journal Brain Stimulation, the researchers write that many patients “fail to fully recover from coma, and awaken to a disorder of consciousness such as the vegetative state or the minimally conscious state.”      The noninvasive procedure used sonic stimulation to excite the neurons in the thalamus, which essentially serves as the brain’s central hub for processing information such as the relaying of sensory and motor signals as well as the regulation of consciousness, sleep and alertness. This is the first time this technique, called low-intensity focused ultrasound pulsation, has been used to treat a severe brain injury.      “It’s almost as if we were jump-starting the neurons back into function,” Martin Monti, the study’s lead author and a UCLA associate professor of psychology and neurosurgery, told Medical Xpress.      With a device that emits a very small amount of energy (less than a traditional ultrasound machine), the doctors were able to target the thalamus. They placed it near the side of the patient’s head and activated it for 30 seconds every minute for a 10-minute period.      Monti explained that until now, the only way to achieve this result was a risky surgical procedure known as deep brain stimulation. This requires the implantation of electrodes directly inside the thalamus. “Our approach directly targets the thalamus but is noninvasive,” he said.      He added that the team was expecting positive results, but that more research needs to be done on additional patients to determine if the technique can consistently be used as a treatment for coma patients.      “As the authors pointed out, with this type of study it is difficult to know if the patient’s improvement was due to the brain stimulation or just the patient improving on his own,” Dr. Aaron S. Lord, director of neurocritical care at NYU Langone Medical Center, told the Observer. “However, targeting the thalamus to stimulate a patient with a disorder of consciousness has been successful in the past, and this new technology has the benefit of being non-invasive, unlike the deep brain stimulation which requires neurosurgery.” ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"Doctors at UCLA have helped a 25-year-old man recover from a coma by using a new technique called low-intensity focused ultrasound pulsation.

She had spent years painstakingly crafting her unique manuscript and didn't want to leave her intellectual property vulnerable to theft. The novel itself was a rich blend of genres, melding science fiction, fantasy, and romance into a thrilling adventure that followed the protagonist, Luna, in her quest to save a fragile world from the brink of destruction. Luna's journey took her through lush, magical forests, and across barren and desolate landscapes, all the while battling her own demons and forming unlikely alliances. Jesse poured her heart and soul into creating this complex world with intricate backstories and interwoven subplots, and she knew she couldn't risk losing the fruits of her labor. To protect her hard work, Jesse began researching the copyright process. She discovered that in most countries, copyright protection was automatic upon the creation of an original work. This meant that her book already had some degree of protection. However, Jesse decided that it would be prudent to take additional steps to ensure her work's security. In order to formally register her book's copyright, Jesse contacted her country's copyright office and obtained the necessary application form. After filling in the required information, she attached a digital copy of her manuscript and sent the completed form, manuscript, and application fee to the copyright office. Once the application was received and processed, Jesse would obtain a certificate of registration that provided her with full copyright protection. In the meantime, Jesse took the initiative to add a copyright notice to the front matter of her book, indicating her ownership of the work and the year it was created. This served as a clear warning to potential infringers that she took her rights seriously. Although the formal registration process wasn't complete yet, Jesse felt more at ease knowing that steps had been taken to protect her book from theft. With her newfound peace of mind, she could now focus on finding a literary agent to represent her work and pursuing her dream of getting her novel published. Jesse spent the following weeks refining her query letter and researching reputable agents within her book's genres. After numerous rejected queries, she finally caught the attention of an agent who expressed enthusiasm for the novel. Before signing an agreement, Jesse made sure to consult with the agent on their stance on protecting her copyright. Together, the two drafted a strategic plan for releasing her book into the public eye. They agreed on a distribution method that utilized digital rights management, ensuring that electronic copies of her novel would be traceable and protected against piracy. Additionally, the plan involved securing licensing deals for translations, adaptations, and any potential derivative works. Jesse and her agent were thorough in their approach to preserving her creative control and ensuring she would reap the benefits of her passion project. Soon, Jesse's novel was published, and the world eagerly received Luna's story. The book quickly gained a loyal following, propelling Jesse into the realm of literary acclaim. Throughout her newfound success, Jesse remained vigilant about safeguarding her work, consistently monitoring and taking action against any infringement on her copyright. In the end, Jesse's diligence in securing her copyright allowed her to share her captivating tale with the world while still protecting her personal, creative investment. The lessons she learned throughout this process armed her with the knowledge and expertise to safeguard future contributions to the literary world, and she became a celebrated role model for aspiring authors. And as for Luna and the fantastical universe Jesse had created, their adventures continued, warranting sequels and adaptations, with Jesse's watchful eye ensuring her vision remained intact."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Options: - body - injury - patient - emergency room - hospital A:","output":"The most suitable option for a person in need of urgent care for a wound would be the emergency room or a hospital. Both these locations have trained medical professionals who are well-equipped to handle and address various types of wounds and provide appropriate treatment.  When a person suffers from a wound, it could range from a minor scratch to a deep laceration or even penetrate vital organs. Thus, it becomes crucial to seek immediate medical attention, especially in cases where the wound is severe, bleeding excessively, or accompanied by signs of infection. At an emergency room or a hospital, medical professionals may examine the wound, clean it, and apply the necessary dressing or stitches to ensure proper healing. They may also inquire about the patient's medical history, the specifics surrounding the injury, and overall health condition to provide a comprehensive assessment and treatment plan accordingly. Furthermore, they may recommend or administer tetanus shots or other vaccinations, antibiotics, or pain management medications if necessary. In conclusion, if a person needs urgent care for a wound, they should visit an emergency room or a hospital to receive professional medical assistance and ensure the best possible outcome for their health and recovery."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Could you please translate this to English?","output":"\\"Our goal is to determine quite specifically, albeit briefly, what we think the state should be like, in general.\\" The statement appears to be an academic or philosophical introduction, where the speaker is expressing a desire to briefly but definitively outline their theory on what a state or government should ideally be like. The statement suggests that the speaker is about to provide their opinion or perspective. This could be a perspective based on certain principles or values such as democracy, socialism, or a philosophical theory underpinning their view on governance.  Given the phrases 'to determine quite specifically' and 'albeit briefly', it is implied that the forthcoming opinion or perspective will be articulated concisely and will not offer an extensive or in-depth exploration of the topic at hand. The phrase 'what we think' indicates a collective perspective, which could suggest a group of individuals, an organization, or a community holds this perspective. Moreover, the phrase 'the state should be like, in general', implies a focus on the general characteristics or principles that should ideally underpin a state or government, rather than specific policies or issues. This could include topics such as the distribution of power, the role of the state in relation to civil society, the economy, individual freedoms, and the rights and responsibilities of citizens. So, this statement implies that the speaker is about to provide a concise but definitive perspective on the principles or characteristics that an ideal state or government should embody. It is likely to be a high-level discussion of the philosophy of governance, rather than a detailed policy discussion. In general, such discussions contribute to a wider discourse on political theory and philosophy, and can inform perspectives on governance, policy-making, and statecraft. Understanding different perspectives on what a 'state' should be can help individuals and societies shape their expectations and prescriptions for governance in a manner that aligns with their values and ideals."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Information:  - Prose is a form of language that exhibits a grammatical structure and a natural flow of speech, rather than a rhythmic structure as in traditional poetry. Where the common unit of verse is based on meter or rhyme, the common unit of prose is purely grammatical, such as a sentence or paragraph.  - Count Lev Nikolayevich Tolstoy (;  ), usually referred to in English as Leo Tolstoy, was a Russian writer who is regarded as one of the greatest authors of all time.  - Count (male) or countess (female) is a title in European countries for a noble of varying status, but historically deemed to convey an approximate rank intermediate between the highest and lowest titles of nobility. The word \\"count\\" came into English from the French \\"comte\\", itself from Latin \\"comes\\"in its accusative \\"comitem\\"meaning companion, and later companion of the emperor, delegate of the emperor. The adjective form of the word is \\"\\". The British and Irish equivalent is an earl (whose wife is a \\"countess\\", for lack of an English term). Alternative names for the \\"count\\" rank in the nobility structure are used in other countries, such as \\"Graf\\" in Germany and \\"Hakushaku\\" during the Japanese Imperial era.  - Good faith, in human interactions, is a sincere intention to be fair, open, and honest, regardless of the outcome of the interaction. While some Latin phrases lose their literal meaning over centuries, this is not the case with \\"bona fides\\"; it is still widely used and interchangeable with its generally accepted modern day translation of \\"good faith\\". It is an important concept within law, philosophy, and business. The opposed concepts are bad faith, \\"mala fides\\" (duplicity) and perfidy (pretense). In contemporary English, the usage of \\"bona fides\\" (note the \\"s\\") is synonymous with credentials and identity. The phrase is sometimes used in job advertisements, and should not be confused with the \\"bona fide\\" occupational qualifications or the employer's good faith effort, as described below.  - Non-fiction or nonfiction is content (sometimes, in the form of a story) whose creator, in good faith, assumes responsibility for the truth or accuracy of the events, people, and/or information presented. In contrast, a story whose creator explicitly leaves open if and how the work refers to reality is usually classified as fiction. Nonfiction, which may be presented either objectively or subjectively, is traditionally one of the two main divisions of narratives (and, specifically, prose writing), the other traditional division being fiction, which contrasts with nonfiction by dealing in information, events, and characters expected to be partly or largely imaginary.   - An essay is, generally, a piece of writing that gives the author's own argument  but the definition is vague, overlapping with those of an article, a pamphlet, and a short story. Essays have traditionally been sub-classified as formal and informal. Formal essays are characterized by \\"serious purpose, dignity, logical organization, length,\\" whereas the informal essay is characterized by \\"the personal element (self-revelation, individual tastes and experiences, confidential manner), humor, graceful style, rambling structure, unconventionality or novelty of theme,\\" etc.  - A narrative or story is any report of connected events, real or imaginary, presented in a sequence of written or spoken words, and/or still or moving images.  - Fiction is the classification for any story or universe derived from imaginationin other words, not based strictly on history or fact. Fiction can be expressed in a variety of formats, including writings, live performances, films, television programs, animations, video games, and role-playing games, though the term originally and most commonly refers to the narrative forms of literature (see \\"literary\\" fiction), including the novel, novella, short story, and play. Fiction constitutes an act of creative invention, so that faithfulness to reality is not typically assumed; in other words, fiction is not expected to present only characters who are actual people or descriptions that are factually true. The context of fiction is generally open to interpretation, due to fiction's freedom from any necessary embedding in reality; however, some fictional works are claimed to be, or marketed as, historically or factually accurate, complicating the traditional distinction between fiction and non-fiction. Fiction is a classification or category, rather than a specific mode or genre, unless used in a narrower sense as a synonym for a particular literary fiction form.  - The Kingdom of God Is Within You ( Russian :     ( Tsarstvo Bozhiye vnutri vas ) ) is a non-fiction book written by Leo Tolstoy . A philosophical treatise , the book was first published in Germany in 1894 after being banned in his home country of Russia . It is the culmination of thirty years of Tolstoy 's thinking , and lays out a new organization for society based on a literal Christian interpretation . The Kingdom of God is Within You is a key text for Tolstoyan , nonviolent resistance , and Christian anarchist movements .  - A treatise is a formal and systematic written discourse on some subject, generally longer and treating it in greater depth than an essay, and more concerned with investigating or exposing the principles of the subject.    What entity does 'the kingdom of god is within you' has the relation 'genre' with? A:","output":"The entity 'The Kingdom of God Is Within You' has the relation 'genre' with 'Non-fiction'. This means that 'The Kingdom of God Is Within You' is of the non-fiction genre. Non-fiction is content whose creator assumes responsibility for the truth or accuracy of the events, people, and/or information presented. This aligns with 'The Kingdom of God Is Within You' being a philosophical treatise, a type of non-fiction work, in which Leo Tolstoy presents and investigates the principles of his subject matter - a Christian interpretation of society."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Premise: \\"oh yeah sure and in addition to that we have the cost because you have to pay something\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"We don't have to pay anything.\\"?","output":"If the premise \\"oh yeah sure and in addition to that we have the cost because you have to pay something\\" is true, it tells us several things about the hypothesis \\"We don't have to pay anything.\\" First, it reveals a logical inconsistency between the premise and the hypothesis, suggesting that they cannot both be true at the same time. Furthermore, it demonstrates that the truth of the premise negates the possibility of the hypothesis being true, leading us to consider the relationship between the two statements, possible explanations for the inconsistency and implications for the broader context in which these statements are being made. Analyzing the premise and the hypothesis, it becomes clear that they are logically contradictory statements. The premise states that there is a cost associated with something—a statement that inherently implies the existence of payment. The hypothesis, on the other hand, claims that there is no need to pay anything. In any given situation, it is impossible for both of these statements to be accurate simultaneously, as one negates the other. Thus, if the premise is considered true, the hypothesis becomes false. There could be several reasons for this inconsistency. One possibility is that the premise and the hypothesis refer to different contexts or aspects of a situation, but have been presented as if they are related. For example, the premise might refer to the cost of purchasing a good or service, while the hypothesis might refer to additional costs associated with that good or service once the initial payment has been made. In this case, it is important to recognize that the apparent contradiction arises from the misinterpretation of the relationship between the two statements, rather than the falsity of one of them. Another possibility is that the premise and hypothesis represent competing viewpoints or beliefs about a particular situation, with one being accurate and the other being incorrect. If, for example, two people are discussing the cost of a software subscription, one person might be convinced that there are hidden costs (the premise) while the other believes otherwise (the hypothesis). In this case, the inconsistency between the two statements highlights the underlying conflict between the beliefs of the individuals involved. Regardless of the cause of the inconsistency, the fact that the premise and hypothesis appear in conflict with each other has implications for the broader context in which they are presented. It suggests that further analysis and information gathering may be needed to determine the accuracy of each statement or to reconcile the apparent contradiction between them. It is also worth noting that the truth of the premise does not necessarily dependent upon whether the hypothesis is false. For example, one might have to pay an initial cost but not have to worry about ongoing expenses. Hence, it is important to keep an open mind when evaluating the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis, and not to jump to conclusions based on the apparent discrepancy between them. In conclusion, given the premise \\"oh yeah sure and in addition to that we have the cost because you have to pay something,\\" the possibility of the hypothesis \\"We don't have to pay anything\\" being true becomes highly unlikely due to their logically contradictory nature. Further exploration of the context and possible explanations for their inconsistency will provide valuable insights into the broader situation and help to clarify the relationship between the two statements."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.
