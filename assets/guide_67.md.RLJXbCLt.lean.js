A dilapidated school where pupils were forced to have lessons in the corridor because of the decaying classrooms is still in a state of disrepair one year on. Teachers at Richard Lee Primary School, in Wyken, Coventry, have told how nothing has changed. One one occasion in the last twelve months, a corridor was turned into a river after blocked and cracked storm drains overflowed. Bleak outlook: Pupils Georgia Diston and Harvey Billing have to resort to holding an umbrella at Richard Lee Primary School in Coventry because there are so many leaks in their dilapidated classroom. Disrepair: After class, the two youngsters have to then walk along crumbling corridors, one of which became a river when a cracked storm drain overflowed. And in the last two weeks, six leaks have sprung up in classroom roofs, forcing the children to hold umbrellas during lessons. It all adds to a tale of woe at the 509-pupil school - soon to increase to 700 students in September - that includes crumbling walls, moldy carpets, drafty doors, cracked windows, collapsing roofs and freezing classrooms. When Nick Gibb, minister of state for schools, visited he dubbed the conditions the worst he has ever seen. Mr Gibb added: 'I would be very cross about the standard of the building if I was a parent with children at the school. This is clearly a very poor building that was built in the 1950s and needs work. Patch job: Headteacher Nicola Harwood in one of the out-of-bounds classrooms, which have sprung six leaks in the last two weeks. Expensive: Mrs Harwood looks up at one of the large leaks in the corridor. She believes it will revealed that it would cost upwards of £1million to bring the school up to standard. 'Children failed': Schools Minister Nick Gibb (pictured) said they were the worst conditions he had ever seen when he visited the school this week. The run-down primary school hit the. headlines last year when four and five-year-olds were forced to have. lessons in a corridor after their classroom was flooded by a faulty. boiler. And just five months later part of a roof collapsed - again forcing kids out of their classroom. Pupils,. teachers and parents have since campaigned for a rebuild - even taking. their fight to Downing Street and the Department for Education in July. Their. protests prompted a visit from Mr Gibb yesterday, where the minister. praised staff in keeping teaching standards at the school high, even. when the facilities were not. He. said: 'This is a school focused on making sure that children improve. their reading and arithmetic, despite the problems that they labour. under.' The school is now part of seven in Coventry bidding for funding as part of the Priority Schools Building Programme. But headteacher Nicola Harwood said: 'We will have to wait and see if funding materialises. Hopefully our school will be at the top of the list to receive money or a rebuild. Frustrated: Mrs Harwood, pointing out a crack in the food store cupboard, is desperately hoping for funding to materialise before conditions get any worse. 'Children failed': Schools Minister Nick Gibb (pictured) said they were the worst conditions he had ever seen when he visited the school this week. 'For now we will have to keep patching up the school and continue to make sure Richard Lee is fit for purpose.' Nicola revealed that it would cost. upwards of £1million to bring the school up to standard - including a. £40,000 boiler system and £25,000 to install new doors and windows. throughout. The headteacher added: 'Since last year when we moved classes into a corridor, that has been flooded by broken storm drains overflowing. 'It was like a river running down the corridor. We are running out of rooms which don’t have anything wrong with them to be honest. 'It meant we had to take classes into the main hall, which is not ideal. 'I think there are issues over funding for schools. They need to do surveys to make sure schools don’t get to the stage we are at again. 'The most frustrating thing is that the decision on who will receive money keeps on being put back. 'It could be another year before we see any change but I am very optimistic and the minister had nothing but good things to say about the level of teaching. Coventry MP Bob Ainsworth, who has raised the school's plight in parliament, said: 'We made sure the schools minister was aware of the really shocking state of the building and he said it was the worst he had seen. 'I knew that if he came he would be shocked and all we can hope for is that it puts Richard Lee at the centre of minds when it comes to deciding funding allocations for the Priority Schools Building Programme.'","output":"Highlights: - Richard Lee Primary School in Coventry remains in disrepair, with decaying classrooms and corridors one year on. - Pupils have been forced to hold umbrellas during lessons due to leaks and have lessons in the corridor after classrooms were flooded. - Schools Minister Nick Gibb called the conditions the worst he has ever seen during his visit to the school. - The school is part of seven in Coventry bidding for funding as part of the Priority Schools Building Programme. - It is estimated that at least £1 million is needed to bring the school up to standard, including a £40,000 boiler system and £25,000 for new doors and windows."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Bears opened the scoring in the first quarter via a 38-yard field goal from Connor Barth. The Lions responded with 10 points in the second quarter via a 29-yard field goal from Matt Prater, and a 16-yard touchdown pass from Matthew Stafford to Anquan Boldin, which made the score 10-3 in favor of the Lions at half-time. The Lions extended their lead in the third quarter via a 54-yard field goal from Prater. The Bears reduced the Lions lead to three points via a 31-yard touchdown pass from Matt Barkley to Cameron Meredith. The Bears regained the lead in the fourth quarter via a 24-yard interception return from Cre'Von LeBlanc. The Lions responded with a seven-yard touchdown run from Stafford with 3:17 left in the game, giving the Lions a 20-17 lead they held onto for the win, and breaking an NFL record with 8 comebacks in a single season. With the win, the Lions have won five games in a row for the first time since 2011.

Let's solve this math problem step by step, just like a puzzle. We have the equation: i = 25*i + 48 The goal is to find out what 'i' is. First, let's try to get all the 'i's on one side of the equation. To do that, we can subtract 25*i from both sides. This way the 25*i on the right will be gone and we will have: i - 25*i = 48 Now, do you know what happens when we have i and then subtract 25*i? It's like having 1 apple and taking away 25 apples. So, it will be: -24*i = 48 We're almost there! Now, we want to have just 'i' on the left-hand side. To do that, we can divide both sides by -24 so that 'i' stands alone: i = 48 / -24 48 divided by -24 equals -2. So, the value of 'i' is -2. That's our answer! i = -2 Good job!

Sometimes, people can change the decision if they think it was not fair. This is called an appeal. A worker from a place called the \\"Highway Agency\\" got this chance, and everyone thinks it is very special. Usually, when someone is waiting for their appeal, they have to stay in a place called jail.

A paper from a doctor said that it was hard to know if the worker really made someone sick.

The worker is accused of giving that bully to someone else, but now we are not sure if that is true. A group of people who know a lot about this bully, called the Herpes Viruses Association, think this worker was treated very badly. They said it was like saying kids did something wrong when they gave their friends chickenpox. Chickenpox is another sickness that many kids get, and it makes them feel itchy and tired.

Marge's cat had black fur and hard to see, she bought her cat a white collar so he was easier to see. The","output":"white collar not only increased the visibility of her cat but also added a touch of style and elegance to his appearance. It soon became evident that this accessory had a significant impact on both Marge's life and her cat's. As the days went by, neighborhood residents began to take note of the eye-catching little feline that confidently strutted around, proudly showcasing his distinctive collar. It wasn't long before Marge's cat started to attract the attention of the other cats in the area, and they were clearly interested in getting to know him better. The camaraderie among the cats was not something Marge had anticipated, but she was pleased to see her beloved pet making new friends. The white collar had a transformative effect on her cat's social life, enabling him to build strong bonds with his fellow feline companions in the area. His newfound popularity even led to a decrease in territorial squabbles, creating a more harmonious environment for all the neighborhood's cats. Marge was grateful for the sense of community that developed among the local cats, but she also noticed that her cat was becoming more adventurous and spending longer periods of time outside. She was concerned for his safety and well-being but didn't want to deny him the opportunity to explore and socialize with his new friends. To address her concerns, Marge decided to invest in a GPS tracking device for her cat's collar. This way, she could keep an eye on his whereabouts and always know where to find him if needed. The GPS tracking device was compact and lightweight, so it didn't affect the cat's comfort or impede his mobility in any way. With this added security measure, Marge could enjoy peace of mind while her cat continued to thrive in his social circles. Marge's decision to buy her cat a white collar soon became a subject of conversation within the neighborhood. It wasn't just the feline community that took notice of the stylish, popular black cat, but also their human counterparts. Having seen the positive effects that the white collar had on the cat's social life, other cat owners in the area started to purchase similar collars for their pets in different colors and designs. The collar quickly became a trend, and soon enough, the neighborhood was filled with fashionable feline friends sporting unique and stylish collars. The collars not only served as a fashion statement, but also a conversation starter among the pet owners. People who had never spoken to each other before would strike up conversations, as they bonded over their shared experiences and appreciation for their cats. The collars also provided a practical benefit in terms of visibility and safety. With the various colors and designs available, it became easier for both cats and their owners to spot each other from a distance, especially during the evenings and early mornings. It reduced the incidents of near misses with cars and other potential hazards, making the neighborhood safer for both cats and people alike. All in all, Marge's simple decision to buy her black cat a white collar had far-reaching consequences that she never imagined. It not only improved her cat's social life and overall well-being but also fostered a closer-knit community among the pet owners in her neighborhood. The stylish and practical collars transformed the way people interacted with each other, bringing them together through shared interests and an appreciation for the happiness and safety of their feline friends."},{"instruction":"The drive up to Rick's place in the hills always made me sick.

Here is an article: SEATTLE (AP)  Northwesterners more accustomed to rain and cooler climate sought refuge from a heat wave on Wednesday, as Seattle recorded the hottest temperature in its history and Portland edged closer to its own record-breaker. The National Weather Service in Seattle recorded 102 degrees by midday at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport, breaking a previous record of 100 degrees, set in downtown Seattle in 1941 and repeated at the airport in 1994. Jay Albrecht, a meteorologist with the service, said it's the hottest it has been in Seattle since records dating to 1891. Meanwhile, Portland ventured into its third day of triple-digit heat Wednesday, hitting 104 degrees by midday. Forecasters said there's a slight chance the city could reach or even surpass its all-time high of 107 degrees, hit four times, most recently in 1981. Doug McDonnal, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in Seattle, said the stretch of hot weather has lasted longer than usual. Wednesday was the fifth consecutive day above 85 degrees for Seattle, he said. Throughout the region, shade, icy treats, ice-cold water, air conditioning units and fans were in high demand. Geno Garcia, 40, a Boeing machinist, headed straight for Sears in Seattle early Wednesday when the family's air conditioning unit broke down. \\"We could have lived without it, but it would have been uncomfortable,\\" he said, as he stood in line with about 100 others who bought air conditioners. Garcia said his family plans to keep cool by hunkering down in the one bedroom that's air conditioned. They've already moved their TV, games and other necessities into that room, and have been eating meals there. Darren Wilson, 38, a concrete finisher from Puyallup, Wash., started his Seattle street paving job at 5:30 a.m., three hours earlier than usual, to beat the heat. \\"I'm drinking lots of water,\\" he said. \\"When I get off work, I'm going to my buddy's house and jump in his pool.\\" Portlanders were trying to stay cool every which way. Public fountains were clogged with children. Libraries swelled with people trying to stay out of the sun. And cooling centers for seniors were open late. Shirley Markstaller, 71, parked herself in front of a fan and read the morning paper at a cooling center in downtown Portland. She doesn't have an air conditioner at home, so she's been coming to the center every day for the past week or so. \\"I just thought, where's the coolest place?\\" she said. The weather throughout the Willamette Valley wasn't much better. Temperatures hit triple digits in Medford, Eugene and Salem by Wednesday afternoon. Coastal cities were cooler, including Astoria and Newport. Temperatures in Bend, Pendleton and La Grande had already reached the 90s by midday. Forecasters have issued an excessive heat warning for much of western Washington through Friday. A heat advisory is in effect through Thursday in parts of eastern Washington, including the Yakima Valley and lower Columbia Basin. Temperatures in western Washington were expected to cool off somewhat on Friday but will still be in the 80s, about 10 degrees higher than usual, McDonnal said. In Olympia, a group of visitors were hoping to cool off at the popular Heritage Park Fountain, but were disappointed to find that the water had been turned off for regular weekly maintenance. \\"We were expecting it to be working,\\" said Lucina Hernandez, 24, of Barcelona, Venezuela. \\"This is very bad.\\" At the Tails-A-Wagging doggie day care in Bellingham, Wash., owner Angi Lenz and her staff kept dogs comfortable with special cooling fans, air conditioning, ice toys and water slides. \\"We have a waiting list to get in this week because of the heat,\\" Lenz said. Not everyone was avoiding the outdoors. Enes Parker, manager of the Lacey Senior Center, said she found indoor air conditioning too cold. Lacey is in Washington, near the state capital of Olympia. \\"I'm one of the few who like the heat,\\" Parker said. \\"I go outside every so often to warm up. I love the heat.

Context: During the Republic, any person who wished to hold public office had to conform to the Reformed Church and take an oath to this effect. The extent to which different religions or denominations were persecuted depended much on the time period and regional or city leaders. In the beginning, this was especially focused on Roman Catholics, being the religion of the enemy. In 17th-century Leiden, for instance, people opening their homes to services could be fined 200 guilders (a year's wage for a skilled tradesman) and banned from the city. Throughout this, however, personal freedom of religion existed and was one factor – along with economic reasons – in causing large immigration of religious refugees from other parts of Europe.","output":"The place mentioned last in the context is Europe."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Sting Answer:","output":"Title: The Legend of the Blade: The Tale of Sting Plot Summary: In the lands of Middle-Earth, with the threat of a new darkness looming, the tale of a legendary sword named Sting unfolds. Secretly forged during the Second Age by elven blacksmiths, Sting was passed down through generations and played a pivotal role in the lives of two remarkable Hobbits, Bilbo and Frodo Baggins. This epic adventure follows the legacy of the sword, revealing its mysterious origins, and the crucial role it plays in uniting the free peoples of Middle-Earth against the dark forces that threaten to consume the world once again. Act I: In the elven realm of Rivendell, master blacksmith Galadrel crafts a magnificent shortsword, embedded with arcane elven runes. Bestowing the blade with magical abilities, he names it Sting - a weapon conceived to fight the encroaching darkness. As the years pass, the sword lies dormant in the secret vaults of the elves, patiently waiting for its rightful wielder. The story then jumps to Bilbo Baggins, a young Hobbit who, alongside the legendary Thorin Oakenshield and his company of dwarves, embarks on a quest to reclaim the dwarf kingdom of Erebor from the fearsome dragon Smaug. During their journey, Bilbo comes upon a hidden chamber within the depths of a misty mountain, where he finds three elven-made swords. One of these swords is Sting, which he takes as his weapon. Act II: Returning to the Shire after his epic adventure, Bilbo discovers the true power of Sting, as it begins to glow brightly in the presence of evil. Together with Gandalf the Grey, he learns about the sword's origins and recognizes its significance in the forthcoming battle against the rising shadows. Bilbo realizes that Sting is not meant for him, but rather for someone else who will play an essential role in the battle. Years later, Bilbo passes his treasured sword Sting to his adopted nephew, Frodo, as he embarks on his own perilous journey to destroy the One Ring. As they learn more about their shared legacy, Frodo and his fellowship must use the power of Sting to overcome numerous enemies and challenges in their path. There are side stories involving other characters, showing their connection to the magical sword. Aragorn, future King of Gondor, feels an inexplicable connection to Sting that hints at the sword's deeper significance. Act III: The climax arrives as Frodo and Sam, guided by Sting's light, successfully reach Mount Doom and destroy the One Ring, freeing Middle-Earth from the dark clutches of Sauron. United by the power of the sword, the peoples of Middle-Earth face the common enemy. The final battle sees Sting playing a crucial role in vanquishing the remaining forces of evil. In conclusion: This thrilling cinematic journey follows the incredible tale of Sting, a sword wielded by two unlikely heroes in two grand adventures. Delving into the sword's origins from the hidden vaults of the elves to its final purpose in the hands of Bilbo and Frodo, \\"The Legend of the Blade: The Tale of Sting\\" serves as an exhilarating chapter in the grand saga of Middle-Earth."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Ambassador Nikki Haley high-fives a child at a shelter in New Delhi last month. (Manish Swarup/AP)      It's difficult to imagine a message more contrary to President Trump's entire ethos than the one offered Monday by his U.N. ambassador, Nikki Haley.      Haley asked high-schoolers attending a Turning Point USA summit at George Washington University whether they had “posted anything online to quote-unquote 'own the libs,' \\" according to the Hill. (\\"Own the libs\\" or \\"trigger the libs\\" means doing something provocative to upset supposedly over-sensitive liberals.) The students reportedly raised their hands en masse and roared.      But then Haley went a different direction.      “I know that it’s fun and that it can feel good, but step back and think about what you’re accomplishing when you do this — are you persuading anyone? Who are you persuading?” Haley asked. “We’ve all been guilty of it at some point or another, but this kind of speech isn’t leadership; it’s the exact opposite.”      She added: “Real leadership is about persuasion, it’s about movement, it’s bringing people around to your point of view — not by shouting them down, but by showing them how it is in their best interest to see things the way you do.”      Again, Haley is a political appointee of President Trump. Trump's entire political strategy is basically about “owning the libs” — and, in the process, making his base rally around him. Haley's comments may not have been intended for Trump, but much like first lady Melania Trump's anti-bullying campaign, there would seem to be some cognitive dissonance here.      This is hardly the first time Haley has offered a somewhat discordant view from inside the Trump administration, but often that's been about establishing her personal independence. This is perhaps the most pronounced example of her separating herself from Trump's version of the Republican Party.      Haley's choice of venue to deliver those lines is particularly noteworthy: TPUSA is a fast-growing group of young conservatives, led by provocateur and Trump ally Charlie Kirk, that is \\"known for its anti-political-correctness, aggressive legal tactics and alleged associations with racism,\\" as the Post's Eliza Gray wrote earlier this month. In other words, Haley decided to deliver this message to an audience that would likely not love it, but she decided to deliver it there anyway.      And while it might be a nice sentiment that is cheered across the aisle, it's not exactly the kind of attitude that is ascendant on the red team. Trump is more popular with the GOP base than basically any recent Republican president, and his bull-in-a-china-shop style has spurred culture wars in which most Republicans are happy warriors.      Haley's approach, then, is counterintuitive for someone who is considered to be a rising star within the GOP — and even a possible future presidential candidate. Haley, if she is interested in climbing the ranks, seems to be betting on a more genteel and pragmatic version of conservatism while the party in recent years has demonstrated it desires anything but. Trump's entire election was basically a middle finger to political moderation — both in policy and rhetoric.      It does seem to be working for Haley, though — at least for now. She appears to be the most popular member of the Trump administration, pulling off the unique trick of wooing Democrats with her independence while not alienating Republicans. (Democrats approved of her 55 percent to 23 percent after her “I don't get confused” rebuke of Larry Kudlow, and Republicans approved 75 to 9.) She's also extremely popular with the young conservative crowd she was speaking to Monday.      Haley's political Teflon dates to 2015, when she went where Southern Republicans generally didn't go by siding against the Confederate flag. She wound up bringing the party with her rather than suffering for her apostasy. And that trend has continued with her in the Trump administration.      But it has also worked as she has been a relatively infrequent presence on the national stage, occasionally popping up when the moment demanded or allowed for it. Were she to apply this kind of approach to a presidential or other campaign in the coming years, it would seem unlikely to catch fire — unless she's able to persuade the party to completely change course and abandon its newfound Trumpiness.      Whether it works is the big, unanswered question. But if she does have higher aspirations, she could provide one of the most interesting — and unique — voices in the battle over the future course of the GOP.

The vast majority raised their hands in response, and then erupted into spontaneous applause.      ADVERTISEMENT      “I know that it’s fun and that it can feel good, but step back and think about what you’re accomplishing when you do this — are you persuading anyone?

However, she also said those in the room Monday made her want to bet on the future.

Human Rights Council, which she called a joke.      She also criticized countries she said agreed with the United States off-the-record but would not publicly support change on the council.      “They lack the courage to make a difference,” Haley said. “They have a voice, they just refuse to use it.”      Haley, who received a standing ovation both coming and going from her speech, posed for students' pictures for a few minutes after concluding her time.      “If I can leave you with one message today: Have the courage to stand up to the mob,” she said. ||||| Not in favor of “owning libs.”      Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and a oft-mentioned future presidential candidate, told a group of conservative high-school students on Monday that one of their favorite activities might be “fun,” and might “feel good,” but it’s not always in their best interest.      She was talking, of course, about “owning the libs.” The Hill provides a transcript of Haley’s remarks on the subject:      “Raise your hand if you’ve ever posted anything online to quote-unquote ‘own the libs,’” Haley asked at the High School Leadership Summit at George Washington University.      The vast majority raised their hands in response, and then erupted into spontaneous applause.      “I know that it’s fun and that it can feel good, but step back and think about what you’re accomplishing when you do this — are you persuading anyone? Who are you persuading?” Haley asked. “We’ve all been guilty of it at some point or another, but this kind of speech isn’t leadership — it’s the exact opposite.”      “Real leadership is about persuasion, it’s about movement, it’s bringing people around to your point of view,” she added. “Not by shouting them down, but by showing them how it is in their best interest to see things the way you do.”      The irony of Haley’s remarks is that they came at an event hosted by Turning Point USA, a group that has made its name by attempting, often with disastrous results, to get under the skin of liberals. The group famously hosted an event at Kent State University last October that saw a student in a diaper, sucking a pacifier and sitting in a playpen. The point? To mock the “safe spaces” that liberal students were demanding. ||||| What is a summary?","output":"U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, urged conservative high school students at a Turning Point USA summit to avoid inflammatory language and focus on demonstrating real leadership. Instead of trying to \\"own the libs,\\" which refers to intentionally upsetting liberals, Haley emphasized that real leadership involves persuasion and bringing people around to your point of view.

Translate to English English:","output":"50,000 human figures are digging for gold here. English: This sentence, translated into English, describes a situation where a large number of people, specifically 50,000 individuals, are diligently searching for gold. The use of the term \\"human figures\\" implies that the individuals may not be fully discernible, possibly due to distance or other factors that might obscure their appearance. Nonetheless, it is clear that these people are working industriously to unearth the precious metal, gold. The reasons for their collective effort might include monetary gain, resource acquisition, or perhaps an event or competition requiring such actions. This scene paints a vivid image of a massive gold rush or an expansive mining operation that spans a considerable area. The sheer number of people involved underscores the significance and perceived value of unearthing gold, which is often linked to wealth, luxury, and financial stability. Throughout history, the pursuit of this highly sought-after metal has fueled numerous expeditions, economic booms, and profound social shifts, such as the California Gold Rush or the Klondike Gold Rush. Various factors could contribute to such a large number of people digging for gold. One possibility is the recent discovery of a gold deposit, which may have attracted thousands of individuals to flock to the area in hopes of striking it rich. Others may have arrived to participate in organizations or events that offer lucrative rewards for the successful searchers. Alternatively, these 50,000 human figures might be part of an intentional collective endeavor aimed at reaping the benefits of gold mining for national, corporate, or personal motives. In any case, the convergence of people on this scale illustrates the enduring allure of gold as an iconic symbol of status, worth, and fortune. The environmental and social impacts of these activities also warrant consideration. The pursuit of gold often leads to the erosion and destruction of natural habitats, and the resulting influx of people can strain existing resources and communities. Although gold remains a coveted commodity, there should be ongoing conversations and collaborative efforts to balance its extraction with the preservation of our planet and its interconnected ecosystems. In summary, the translated phrase \\"50,000 human figures are digging for gold here\\" presents a powerful image of a massive collective undertaking driven by the allure of financial gain and prosperity. The reasons behind this pursuit, as well as the broader social, environmental, and economic implications, offer intriguing insights into the nature of human ambition and the power of collaboration toward a shared goal."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I had two, one for staff accountant and the other was as accounting manager for a holistic health clinic. The clinic job paid about 40% more and came with a “manager” title. I believed in myself and all that, but who offers someone just out of school with only 2 years of internship and no specialty in field manager level? That kept bugging me. Something just wasn’t right. Acting on instinct, I took the other job. Good thing! A few months later, I read that the owner of the clinic (an MD) and his two partners (his wife and the CFO) had all been indicted for numerous counts of fraud. They were cheating the state, they were cheating the church they were affiliated with, they were cheating Medicare and private insurance companies. The IRS was after them — it was supposed to be not-for-profit but it turns out they were living large. Not only that, but they hadn’t been sending in w/h tax for non-church member paid employees. Then there was the allegation that they were abusing mentally handicapped workers who were related to church members. The church itself tried to distance themselves, but three elders were also on the clinic’s Board of Directors. It was nasty and the entire management team ended up with at least some jail time. There was no way anyone who had any access to the records (medical or financial) could have claimed innocence. My job would have included filing false budget and financial statements with the Board, IRS and other agencies. I would have also probably known that they were withholding but not remitting tax from employee checks. Fact is, the poor kid who took the job got 2 years, so I found out. Those in on the medical fraud got even worse and the three principals all got 2-digit sentences.

The merchants, nobles, and the slaves lucky enough to attend had waited outside Dan Trex's arena for days. They knew the value of entertainment in such a dark world. They wore cowls to protect themselves from the sun as they waited. Entire businesses thrived on the forced mercantile of the captive audience. Food went for thrice its cost to those waiting near the entrance. Water went for five times as much. The arena was as old as the city, built in the days of the old empire for a king now long forgotten.

The machine had built Dan Trex's army, half a million of the most ruthless and well trained soldiers to ever walk the planet. While one hundred and fifty thousand civilians and slaves got drunk, gambled, shat, fucked, and slept on the stone steps; one hundred thousand of his men sat in silence wearing black and bronze and watching him as Trex walked out into the arena alone and unhelmed.

Janet states that her water is so cold it hurts her teeth and wishes hers was warmer. They agree to mention it to the waitress when she returns.  But I can use this background: Liquid water is a fluid. The hydrogen bonds in liquid water constantly break and reform as the water molecules tumble past one another. As water cools, its molecular motion slows and the molecules move gradually closer to one another. The density of any liquid increases as its temperature decreases. For most liquids, this continues as the liquid freezes and the solid state is denser than the liquid state. However, water behaves differently. It actually reaches its highest density at about 4°C.  What is an answer for this question: Which person's water has molecules moving faster? Answer:","output":"Kim's water has molecules moving faster.  In this situation, Kim's water is at room temperature and Janet's water is so cold that it hurts her teeth. Considering the information about liquid water and its temperature behavior, as the water temperature increases, its molecular motion becomes faster. Conversely, as the water temperature decreases, the molecular motion slows down. Since Kim's water is warmer than Janet's water, the molecules in Kim's water are moving faster as they have higher kinetic energy associated with increased temperature. Janet's water has slower moving molecules due to its colder temperature and the decreased kinetic energy of the molecules."},{"instruction":"You are considering whether to buy a product.

We were graced with the presence of director Mike Binder and stars Adam Sandler and Don Cheadle who took audience questions after the film. It is a remarkable and powerful film about what it is like to lose yourself and begin to find your way back. The performances are phenomenal and the story manages to be both tragic and funny in a way that is all too rare. (The trailer for the film tries a little too hard to emphasize the comedic aspects.) This is a breakout role for Adam Sandler. While he has begun to transition to more dramatic roles with Punch-Drunk Love and Spanglish, this role is a significant step forward for him as a dramatic actor. He deserves an Oscar nomination as he continues down to transition to more dramatic roles as Tom Hanks did and Jim Carrey is also doing. In this role, he seemed to be trying to channel Dustin Hoffman in Rain Man. Although playing an autistic man is certainly very different than Sandler's traumatized character, both characters for different reasons are trapped in their own worlds of child-like isolation and confusion. Don Cheadle's performance is less surprising, but just as good. After Hotel Rwanda and Crash, we've come to expect remarkable nuanced performances from Cheadle. He has the qualities of sincerity and honesty that comes through in this role. But he, too, is also broken and struggling if not in the such profound ways as Sandler's character. Cheadle is struggling with difficulties in both his marriage and in his professional life as a dentist. Together the characters played by Cheadle and Sandler struggle to heal each other in the way that true friends often do (in a way that reminds me of Matt Damon and Robin Williams in Good Will Hunting). They are both searching for that part of the themselves that they have lost and trying to find again. Reign over Me is one of the best major studio films to be released this year. The soundtrack, which is almost another character in the plot is wonderful. The filming in the streets of New York - a city that suffered a great tragedy and has also had to heal itself - is also quite beautiful. The supporting roles by Jada Pinkett Smith, Liv Tyler, Saffron Burrows (in a very odd role), Donald Sutherland, and Mike Binder himself are all quite good. Writer/Director Mike Binder has really delivered a story that so many will be able to connect with on numerous levels. This is a story about grief, family, healing, male friendship, mental health, and the meaning of love. Reign over Me does not disappoint. The film is almost hypnotic as it draws you into the lives of its characters. Hollywood would have a much better reputation if it made more character-driven charming films like Reign over Me.

Title: Snake Eyes Movie plot: On a dark and stormy night, corrupt, flamboyant Atlantic City police detective Rick Santoro (Nicolas Cage) attends a boxing match at Gilbert Powell's (John Heard) Atlantic City Arena between heavyweight champion Lincoln Tyler (Stan Shaw) and challenger Jose Pacifico Ruiz. He meets up with his best friend since childhood, Kevin Dunne (Gary Sinise), who is a US Navy Commander working with the Department of Defense to escort Defense Secretary Charles Kirkland (Joel Fabiani) and Powell at the fight after a trip to Norfolk, Virginia. As the first round begins, Dunne is distracted by an attractive redhead named Serena (Jayne Heitmeyer) who wears a ruby ring, and leaves his seat, which is then taken by Julia Costello (Carla Gugino), a mysterious woman with platinum blonde hair and a white satin suit. When Tyler is unexpectedly knocked out by Ruiz, gunshots ring out, mortally wounding Kirkland and grazing Costello, who loses her glasses and blonde wig, revealing her naturally dark hair. Dunne kills the sniper and Santoro orders the arena to be locked down. Despite the lockdown, Costello escapes into the casino, covers her wounds in pieces of cloth from her blouse and after stealing a black satin jacket, disguises herself as a hooker. Santoro becomes suspicious when he notices that the 'knocked out' Tyler woke up instantly when the shots rang out, and after studying the fight tape, realizes the knockout punch didn't connect. In his dressing room, Tyler confesses that he threw the fight in order to pay gambling debts, but he was never told that anyone would be killed and reveals that he was paid to take a dive by Serena, the same red-headed woman who tricked Dunne into leaving his post. With the involvement of Tyler, Serena and the sniper - in addition to the man who signaled Tyler to go down and whoever gave him the go-ahead - Santoro suspects a conspiracy and, in the conference room, reveals everything he has learned to Dunne.

After several weeks of discussion and weighing the pros and cons of each option, the family members concluded that a porch would not only offer a versatile space but also fit better within their budget. In a time of economic instability, the family believed that going for a more financially sound decision would be beneficial in the long run. Furthermore, the homeowners had also factored in the increased costs of heating and cooling associated with a sun room in their decision-making process. While a sun room would have beautifully displayed natural sunlight and provided a picturesque view of the surrounding landscape, it would also mean significantly higher energy bills throughout the year. The family also consulted with an architect who advised them on the practicality of adding a porch versus a sun room. They learned that a porch would be easier and faster to build, causing less disruption to their home life. Moreover, the porch could be added without the need for any significant structural changes to the house, making the construction process much faster and more cost-effective. As they began planning their new porch, they discovered there were many opportunities to make the space welcoming and functional, despite the lower price point. With the help of a skilled designer, they chose a beautiful and durable material for the flooring and selected outdoor furniture that would be resistant to the elements. The family envisioned their future porch as a peaceful retreat for reading, enjoying a morning coffee, and watching the sunset in the evenings. They also saw it as a place where they could entertain friends and family members during casual gatherings or barbecues. By adding potted plants and flowers around the perimeter, the porch would be a beautiful, natural space that would seamlessly blend with their property's landscaping. Throughout the process, the family members occasionally second-guessed their choice to prioritize cost savings over the luxury of a sun room. However, they continued to reassure themselves that they had made the right decision by focusing on their future enjoyment and the potential memories they would create on their porch. Once the construction was complete, the family was delighted with their new addition. The porch served as a relaxing sanctuary for each member to unwind after a hard day's work, spend quality time together, and experience a deeper connection with nature. While a sun room might have provided a more sheltered and warm space, the porch's open design allowed them to embrace their love for the outdoors and delight in the fresh breeze, sunshine, and bird songs. In the end, the family embraced their decision to build a porch wholeheartedly, understanding that this choice would be a wise investment for both their finances and the long-lasting memories they would create on this beautiful, functional, and budget-friendly addition to their home."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Firstly, the reviewer mentioned that the app works with their Samsung S4 but experienced difficulty when using it on their Note 4, specifically in terms of amperage display. This indicates that the app might not be compatible or have certain issues with specific devices. Compatibility and functionality are essential in terms of using any app. However, since it does work on the Samsung S4, there could be a possibility that your friend's device might not experience the same issue. Secondly, the reviewer states that the app is \\"not accurate,\\" which raises concerns about the app's performance and reliability. It is vital for an app, especially one measuring battery charging details, to provide accurate information to the users. This inaccuracy can lead to potential misjudgments by the users and may affect their device's battery life and performance in the long run. However, it's also important to note that app experiences can be subjective, and the reviewer might have encountered a unique issue that other users have not. Lastly, the reviewer's negative experience should not be entirely overlooked. For your friend, it's essential to have a more comprehensive overview of the app by checking other reviews and making an informed decision based on feedback from a more extensive user base. There could be other user reviews that might provide a more positive experience with the app or explain solutions to the encountered issue.

General Mohammad Zahir Azimi, spokesman for the defence ministry, said “hundreds” of foreign and Afghan insurgents were involved in the attack, which took place in the Ghazi Abad district of Kunar province in the early hours. He confirmed that 19 soldiers were dead and two injured following a four-hour gun battle between the insurgents and the army. An army support unit en route to assist the operation was also targeted by a suicide bomber, he said, but there were no military casualties. An investigation and search and rescue operation was under way, Azimi said. Abdul Ghani Musamem, spokesman for the governor of Kunar Province, said seven soldiers were missing following the attack. It was not immediately clear if the soldiers had been kidnapped or had fled during the assault. President Hamid Karzai condemned the attack and postponed a planned trip to Sri Lanka. Karzai appeared to point a finger at Pakistan, calling on the government in Islamabad to take on the fight against terrorism. He said in a statement that Pakistan must take serious measures to destroy terrorist sanctuaries.Kunar lies along the border with Pakistan. It is a militant stronghold, and many Arab and other foreign insurgents are believed to operate there alongside the Afghan Taliban. Kabul has repeatedly accused Islamabad of providing the insurgents sanctuary on its territory following the US-led invasion of Afghanistan in 2001. The Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack in an emailed statement, saying that one of their insurgents was killed and two were wounded. The Taliban have escalated attacks in recent months as they try to take advantage of the withdrawal of foreign troops at the end of 2014. Casualties among Afghan troops have been rising significantly since they took the lead in the war against the Taliban. Since the beginning of 2014, 84 Afghan army soldiers have been killed. Meanwhile the spokesman for Afghanistan’s Taliban said they had suspended “mediation” with the United States to exchange captive US soldier Bowe Bergdahl for five senior Taliban prisoners held in Guantanamo Bay. In a terse emailed statement on Sunday, Zabihullah Mujahed blamed the “current complex political situation in the country” for the suspension of what was considered the best chance of securing Bergdahl’s freedom since his capture in 2009. It is the first official acknowledgement of indirect talks with the US to free Bergdahl. Bergdahl, 27, of Hailey, Idaho, was last seen in a video released in December, footage seen as “proof of life” demanded by the United States. Bergdahl is believed to be held in the border regions between Afghanistan and Pakistan.

Question: ...And Justice for All is a studio album from Metallican that was the first to feature the bassist who was also part of which other bands? Answer:","output":"...And Justice for All is the fourth studio album by the American heavy metal band Metallica, released on August 25, 1988, through Elektra Records. This album was the first to feature bassist Jason Newsted, who joined the band following the tragic death of their original bassist, Cliff Burton, in a bus accident in 1986. Before joining Metallica, Jason Newsted was part of several other bands, as detailed below: 1. Flotsam and Jetsam: Newsted was a founding member of the thrash metal band Flotsam and Jetsam, formed in Phoenix, Arizona, in 1981. He played bass and contributed to songwriting for the band's debut album, \\"Doomsday for the Deceiver,\\" which was released in 1986. After Cliff Burton's death, Newsted auditioned for Metallica and eventually left Flotsam and Jetsam to join them. 2. Ozzy Osbourne: Although not an official member, Newsted had a brief stint playing bass for Ozzy Osbourne during the Diary of a Madman tour in 1986 as a temporary replacement for Rudy Sarzo. This opportunity came just before Newsted joined Metallica. 3. Echobrain: After leaving Metallica in 2001, Newsted formed the alternative rock band Echobrain with vocalist/guitarist Dylan Donkin and drummer/programmer Brian Sagrafena. The band released their self-titled debut album in 2002, showcasing Newsted's versatility as a bassist in a genre different from his thrash metal roots. 4. Ozzy Osbourne (again): In 2003, Newsted briefly rejoined Ozzy Osbourne's band for the recording of the album \\"Bark at the Moon.\\" However, he left the project before it was completed due to an injury. 5. Voivod: In 2002, Newsted became the bassist for Canadian progressive metal band Voivod, contributing not only to their 2003 self-titled album but also to their 2006 release, \\"Katorz.\\" Furthermore, he played with the band at various live performances and festivals. 6. Newsted: In 2012, Jason Newsted formed a new heavy metal band under his last name. The band released the \\"Metal\\" EP in 2013, followed by the full-length album \\"Heavy Metal Music\\" later that same year. Unfortunately, the band disbanded in early 2014. In addition to these bands, Jason Newsted has participated in various side projects, guest appearances, and one-off collaborations throughout his career. However, it's his significant role in Metallica's \\"...And Justice for All\\" album that solidified his place in the world of heavy metal."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Step 2: Simplify the equation Before we solve the equation for d, let's simplify the right side of the equation by adding the two constant terms together. -17845 - 26705 = -44550 So, the simplified equation is -810*d = -44550. Step 3: Solve for d To solve for d, we need to isolate the variable d on one side of the equation. Since d is currently being multiplied by -810, we need to perform the opposite operation, which is dividing by -810, in order to isolate d. (-810*d) / (-810) = (-44550) / (-810) Both sides of the equation are divided by -810, which cancels out the -810 on the left side, leaving us with: d = 55 The solution for the given problem is d = 55."},{"instruction":"Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: The movie starts off in a small town in Nebraska.

Kelly is a prostitute who shows up in the small town of Grantville, just one more burg in a long string of quick stops on the run after being chased out of the big city by her former pimp. She engages in a quick tryst with local police captain Griff, who then tells her to stay out of his town and refers her to a cat-house just across the state line. Instead, she decides to give up her illicit lifestyle, becoming a nurse at a hospital for handicapped children. Griff doesn't trust reformed prostitutes, however, and continues trying to run her out of town. Kelly falls in love with J.L.

After a dream-like courtship where even Kelly's admission of her past can't deter Grant, the two decide to marry.

To support his hospitalized mother, Ida, Victor cons others by intentionally choking at restaurants to get money from his rescuers. When he visits his mother one day, he meets Dr. Paige Marshall, who takes care of her. She tells Victor that his mother's condition is worsening and that they could try an experimental stem cell technique that would require harvesting cells from the umbilical cord of a newborn baby with Victor's genes. She convinces Victor to have sex with her so she can have his child and save his mother. Victor never knew his father and is anxious to obtain the information from his mother, but she never recognizes him when he visits. He asks Denny to pose as him and ask her questions.

Victor and Paige try several times to have sex, but Victor cannot maintain an erection. After discussing it with Denny, he realizes he loves Paige.

Answer the following question: I heard that Ash smacked Bailey's lips because Bailey was telling mean lies about Ash.  And I was wondering How would you describe Ash? Answer:","output":"Ash can be described as someone who reacted impulsively and emotionally to Bailey's actions. Ash might have felt hurt, betrayed, or angered by the mean lies that Bailey was spreading about them, which led to the physical confrontation – smacking Bailey's lips. The act of smacking Bailey's lips suggests that Ash may have difficulty managing their emotions or has a low tolerance for dishonesty and betrayal. Additionally, it could imply that Ash is protective of their reputation and values their image. However, it is essential to recognize that resorting to physical aggression is not a healthy or constructive way to address conflicts or express emotions. Ideally, Ash should have confronted Bailey and communicated their feelings through a more civilized and non-violent approach."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Sometimes, however, a couple can not have a child of their own. In this case, they may decide to adopt  a child. In fact, adoption is very common today. There are about 60 thousand adoptions each year in the United States alone. Some people prefer to adopt _ , others adopt older children, some couples adopt children from their own countries, and others adopt children from foreign countries. In any case, they all adopt children for the same reason ---- they care about children and want to give their adopted child a happy life. Most adopted children know that they are adopted. Psychologists  and child-care experts generally think this is a good idea. However, many adopted children or adoptees have very little information about their biological parents. As a matter of fact, it is often very difficult for adoptees to find out about their birth parents because the birth records of most adoptees are usually sealed. The information is secret so no one can see it. Naturally, adopted children have different feelings about their birth parents. Many adoptees want to search for them, but others do not. The decision to search for birth parents is a difficult one to make. Most adoptees have mixed feelings about finding their biological parents. Even though adoptees do not know about their natural parents, they do know that their adopted parents want them, love them and will care for them. Question: Why is it difficult for adoptees to find out about their birth parents? Options: A: They are usually adopted from distant places.

The nerve endings explain why your skin is sensitive. You can sense pain, pressure, and temperature. You cut your finger and it starts to bleed. What has happened? If your skin bleeds, it means you have cut the dermis layer and damaged blood vessels. The cut really hurts. It hurts because of the nerve endings in this skin layer.

About four-fifths of high school students in China have poor eyesight . And now more and more children in primary school need glasses, too. Two main reasons can cause poor eyesight: too much time spent indoors studying and too little time spent outdoors playing. Reading and writing for hours and hours, sometimes in poorly lighted rooms, causes eyesight to weaken. But students have to do this because there is so much pressure on them to succeed in school. They have less time to enjoy the sun. The sun, it turns out, is important in developing good eyesight. According to a study by Australian National University, Australian children and Chinese children have the same level of eyesight before they start school, but once they enter primary school, Chinese children only spend about an hour a day outside, while Australian children spend three to four hours each day in the sunshine. The result is that while about forty percent of Chinese primary school students need glasses, only three percent of Australian children do. And poor eyesight at a young age can have serious long term influence. As you get older, your eyesight can worsen. With all that in mind, don't you think it's time to give your eyes a break? Which can cause poor eyesight according to the reading? A) Like reading and writing very much. B) Spend too much time enjoying the sun. C) Spend too much time indoors studying.

The Ostrogoths traced their origins to the Greutungi  a branch of the Goths who had migrated southward from the Baltic Sea and established a kingdom north of the Black Sea, during the 3rd and 4th centuries. They built an empire stretching from the Black Sea to the Baltic. The Ostrogoths were probably literate in the 3rd century, and their trade with the Romans was highly developed. Their Danubian kingdom reached its zenith under King Ermanaric, who is said to have committed suicide at an old age when the Huns attacked his people and subjugated them in about 370.  - Radegund (also spelled \\"Rhadegund, Radegonde, or Radigund\\"; 520  13 August 587) was a Thuringian princess and Frankish queen, who founded the Abbey of the Holy Cross at Poitiers. She is the patron saint of several churches in France and England and of Jesus College, Cambridge (whose full name is \\"The College of the Blessed Virgin Mary, Saint John the Evangelist \\"and the glorious Virgin Saint Radegund\\", near Cambridge\\").  - Theodahad (born c. 480 in Tauresium  died 536) was the King of the Ostrogoths from 534 to 536 and a nephew of Theodoric the Great through his sister Amalafrida.  - Baderic, Baderich, Balderich or Boderic (ca. 480  529), son of Bisinus and Basina, was a co-king of the Thuringii. He and his brothers Hermanfrid and Berthar succeeded their father Bisinus. After Hermanfrid defeated Berthar in battle, he invited King Theuderic I of Metz to help him defeat Baderic in return for half of the kingdom. Theuderic I agreed and Baderic was defeated and killed in 529. Hermanfrid became the sole king.  - Wacho (or Waccho) (probably Waldchis) was king of the Lombards before they entered Italy from an unknown date (perhaps c. 510) until his death in 539. His father was Unichis. Wacho usurped the throne by assassinating (or having assassinated) his uncle, King Tato (again, probably around 510). Tato's son Ildchis fought with him and fled to the Gepids where he died. Wacho had good relations with the Franks.  - Theodemir was king of the Ostrogoths of the Amal Dynasty, and father of Theoderic the Great. He had two \\"brothers\\" (actually brothers-in-law) named Valamir and Videmir. Theodemir was Arian, while his wife Erelieva was Catholic and took the Roman Christian name Eusebia upon her baptism. He took over the three Pannonian Goth reigns after the death of Widimir, ruled jointly with his brothers-in-law as a vassal of Attila the Hun. The reason is probably that this relatively long reign of the Ostrogoths in Pannonia, while his elder brother Thiudimir only for four years on the throne, followed by Theoderic, and firstly inherited, the heirless, Walamir's part of the kingdom. He was married to Erelieva, with whom he had two children: Theoderic (454526) and Amalafrida. When Theodemir died in 475, Theoderic succeeded him as king.  - Hermanfrid (also Hermanifrid or Hermanafrid) was the last independent king of the Thuringii in present-day Germany. He was one of three sons of King Bessinus (or Bisinus) and the Lombard Menia (or Basina). His siblings were Baderic; Radegund (the elder), married to the Lombard king Wacho; and Bertachar.  - Amalafrid ( Latin : Amalafridas , Greek : '  ) was the son of the last Thuringian king Hermanafrid and his wife Amalaberga , daughter of Amalafrida and niece of the Ostrogothic king Theodoric the Great . After the fall of the royal Thuringian seat of Scithingi to the king of Metz , Theuderic I in 531 , Amalaberga fled to the Ostrogothic king Theodahad , her brother , with Amalafrid and his sister Rodelinda . They were captured by the Byzantine general Belisarius and sent to Constantinople , together with the captured Ostrogothic king Witiges ( or Wittigis ) . Justinian made Amalafrid a general and married off his sister Rodelinda to the Lombard king Audoin . When the Lombards applied to the Byzantine Emperor Justinian I for help against the Gepids , he sent an army under the command of Justinus and Justinianus , the sons of Germanus ; Aratius and Suartuas ( a former ruler of the Heruli ) ; and Amalafrid . All the former remained in Ulpiana , Illyria , to decide on a question of doctrine among the local Christians . Amalafrid led part of the Roman army against the Gepids . As Audoin afterwards sent envoys to Justinian to complain about the lack of Imperial help , this seems to have been only a small part of the original army . Nevertheless , Amalafrid and the Lombard host under Audoin won a major victory over the Gepids . Amalafrid had a son named Artachis ( see Venantius Fortunatus , Carm . App. 3 ) but nothing further is known of his fate .  - Amalaberga was the daughter of Amalafrida, daughter of Theodemir, king of the Ostrogoths. Her father is unknown, her uncle was Theodoric the Great. She married Hermanfrid, king of the Thuringii. They had a son named Amalafrid and a daughter Rodelinda, who married the Lombard king Audoin. According to Procopius (History of the Wars V, 13), after Hermanfrid's death, she fled with her children to her brother Theodahad who was at that time (534-36) King of the Ostrogoths.  - Alduin, Auduin, or Audoin (Langobardic: \\"Aldwin\\", or \\"Hildwin\\") was king of the Lombards from 546 to 560. Under him the Lombards became fœderati of the Byzantines (541), signing a treaty with Justinian I which gave them power in Pannonia and the north. Beginning in 551, Audoin was obliged to send troops to serve Narses in Italy in the Gothic War against the Ostrogoths. The next year (552), he sent over 5,000 men to defeat the Goths on the slopes of Vesuvius. That same year Audoin had been able to inflict a heavy defeat on the Gepids with the help of his brother-in-law Amalafrid: the Gepid king Thurisind lost his eldest son, Turismod, in the Battle of Asfeld during which the prince was killed by Alboin, son of Audoin.

Rouvas was born on 5 January 1972 in the village of Mandoukion, near Corfu City on the island of Corfu, the eldest of four sons of Konstantinos \\"Kostas\\" Rouvas (an ambulance driver) and the teenaged Anna-Maria Panaretou (a duty-free shop clerk at the local airport). He has three brothers: Billy (b. Vasilios), Tolis (b. Apostolos, 1975) and Nikos (b. Nikolaos, 1991). The family was poor, and Rouvas began taking care of his brothers at age five. At age four, he exhibited athletic ability and took ballet classes as a child. After moving to Patras, Rouvas continued to look for performance opportunities until he met Dakis (a popular Greek artist who was the first person to help him professionally). Rouvas moved to Athens, and made his first professional appearance in 1991 at the Show Centre. His showmanship attracted the attention of music executives such as Nikos Mouratidis, who encouraged songwriter Giorgos Pavrianos to produce him. Rouvas, singing Michael Jackson's \\"Man in the Mirror\\" was discovered by PolyGram executives who signed him to his first recording contract. After moving to Athens he lived with an older English woman named Sally, with whom he had begun a relationship on Corfu. Their relationship ended when Psinakis became Rouvas' manager, and the singer became more career-oriented. The media has speculated about Rouvas' personal life and relationships with model Zeta Logotheti, Sofi Kantarou (a Corfu bar manager) and singer Elli Kokkinou. Several months later he debuted at the Thessaloniki Song Festival, losing Best Vocal Performance to Giorgos Alkaios but singing the Best Composition (\\"Par'ta\\"; \\"Take Them\\", with music by Nikos Terzis and lyrics by Giorgos Pavrianos). There was a brief earthquake during the festival.  Rouvas released his eponymous debut album, which topped the Greek Albums Chart, the day after the festival. \\"Par'ta\\" became a radio hit, and other songs of the album such as \\"1992\\", \\"Ego S'agapo\\" (\\"I Love You\\") and \\"Gia Fantasou\\" (\\"Imagine\\") also became popular.  In September 1992 Rouvas released his second album, Min Andistekese (Don't Resist), also composed by Nikos Terzis. It produced the singles \\"Gyrna\\" (\\"Return\\"), \\"Min Andistekese\\", \\"Na Ziseis Moro Mou\\" (\\"Live, My Baby\\") and \\"Me Kommeni Tin Anasa\\" (\\"Breathless\\"), with a music video of the title track. The album's success helped establish Rouvas at the top of the Greek music scene.  In October 1993 Rouvas released his third album, Gia Sena (For You), with music by Alexis Papadimitriou and lyrics by Eleni Giannatsoulia and Evi Droutsa.

An understanding of the antibody responses to the viral components is very important for diagnosis and vaccine development. Objective: The spectrum of SARS-specific antibody profiles in SARS patients was investigated from 7 to 210 days after the onset of the symptoms. Study design: Serial serum samples from 14 SARS patients were isolated from 7 to 210 days after the onset of the symptoms, and were tested for anti-viral IgG and IgM by indirect immunofluorescence tests (IFA), anti-nucleocaspid antibody by ELISA tests and viral neutralization. Results: Anti-viral (IgG) and anti-nucleocaspid antibodies were observed in 13 of 14 patients at 14 days after the onset of symptoms, and in all 14 patients at 30-210 days thereafter. Anti-viral antibody (IgM) was detected maximally at 30 days, later than that for the IgG class. IgM antibody declined and became undetectable between 60 to 180 days after the onset of the symptoms. Neutralizing viral antibodies were demonstrated in the sera from all of the patients with SARS symptoms. Conclusions: Anti-viral IgG, IgM, and anti-nucleocaspid antibodies were detected 7-30 days in patients after the onset of SARS symptoms. Anti-viral IgM antibodies disappeared earlier than IgG. Viral neutralization was demonstrated in the sera from the convalescent patients.

It seems so calculated and cold-hearted.\\" \\"Yes,\\" he replied, nodding his head in agreement. \\"But Haversham has always been a man of action and practicality. He's not one to sit idly by and watch the family line diminish or, worse yet, become extinct.

In January 1985, two armed robbers broke into Drescher and Jacobson's Los Angeles apartment. While one ransacked their home, Drescher and a female friend were raped by the other at gunpoint. Jacobson was also physically attacked, tied up, and forced to witness the entire ordeal. It took Drescher many years to recover, and it took her even longer to tell her story to the press. She was paraphrased as saying in an interview with Larry King that although it was a traumatic experience, she found ways to turn it into something positive. In her book Cancer Schmancer, the actress writes: \\"My whole life has been about changing negatives into positives.\\" Her rapist, who was on parole at the time of the crime, was returned to prison and given two life sentences.  After separating in 1996, Drescher and Jacobson divorced in 1999. They had no children. Drescher stated, \\"I would have been able to conceive but not hold on.\\" Drescher has worked to support LGBT rights issues after her former husband came out. Drescher has stated that the primary reason for the divorce was her need to change directions in life. Drescher and Jacobson remain friends and business partners.

The details of the operation (actually, there were several such operations) are handed to two intelligence officers, Colonel Logan and Major Harvey. They are initially unable to devise such a plan – but one night, Harvey sees an actor at a London theatre, putting on a convincing impression of General Bernard Montgomery. Logan and Harvey discover that the actor is M. E. Clifton James (who plays himself in the film), a lieutenant stationed in Leicester with the Royal Army Pay Corps and that he was a professional actor in peacetime. He is called to London, on the pretext that he is to make a test for an army film, and a plan is devised that he should tour North Africa, impersonating 'Monty'. 'Jimmy' as Harvey calls him, is doubtful that he can carry off an impersonation of Montgomery, especially with his air of command, but with time running short and no options open to him, he agrees. Disguised as a corporal, he spends some days at Montgomery's headquarters and learns to copy the general's mannerisms and style. After an interview with the general himself, he is sent off to tour North Africa. Accompanied by Harvey, who has been 'promoted' to brigadier for his cover as Montgomery's aide-de-camp, 'Jimmy' arrives at Gibraltar, where the governor, who has known the general for years, can't get over the likeness. To further foster the deception, a local businessman and known German agent, Karl Nielson, is invited to dinner, knowing that he will spread the information.

Finally, I will determine if the answers to these questions are the same. Question 1: The main arguments of the dissenting justices against the ruling in favor of same-sex marriages in the 2015 U.S. Supreme Court case, Obergefell v. Hodges, were as follows: 1. Chief Justice John Roberts argued that the decision to legalize same-sex marriage should be left to the legislative process, as opposed to being determined by the courts. He expressed concern for the implications of judicial overreach, emphasizing that the Constitution does not explicitly guarantee the right to same-sex marriage. 2. Justice Antonin Scalia criticized the majority decision as a threat to democracy and as an overreach of judicial power. He believed that the matter of same-sex marriage should be decided by the people through democratic processes, not by an unelected judiciary. 3. Justice Clarence Thomas questioned the fundamental right to same-sex marriage, arguing that it was not rooted in the Constitution. He also raised concerns about how the ruling would impact religious liberty and maintained that states, rather than the federal government, should have the power to regulate marriage. 4. Justice Samuel Alito worried that the decision could lead to potential conflicts with religious freedom for those who hold traditional views on marriage. He too argued that the definition of marriage should be determined by the democratic process. Question 2: The Supreme Court ruled in favor of same-sex marriages in Obergefell v. Hodges for several reasons: 1. Equal protection under the law: The majority opinion, authored by Justice Anthony Kennedy, stated that the 14th Amendment guarantees equal protection under the law, including the right to marry for same-sex couples. Denying this right would be a violation of due process and equal protection. 2. Marriage as a fundamental right: The Court determined that the right to marry is a fundamental right protected by the Constitution. Thus, any restrictions on individuals based on their sexual orientation would be subject to strict scrutiny, and the states' bans on same-sex marriage failed to meet this high standard. 3. Dignity and autonomy: The majority opinion emphasized that marriage conferred dignity and respect on couples and that denying same-sex couples the right to marry would be a violation of their dignity and autonomy. Lemma: From the given options A) No and B) Yes; Would the answer to these two questions be the same? Since the dissenting justices' arguments focused on concerns regarding judicial overreach, deference to the democratic process, the interpretation of the Constitution, and concerns about religious liberty, while the Supreme Court's majority opinion emphasized equal protection, fundamental rights, and dignity and autonomy, the answers are fundamentally different in their reasoning. Therefore, I choose A) No, the answer to these two questions would not be the same."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Q: who was the god of the underworld in ancient egypt? A:","output":"A: The god of the underworld in ancient Egypt was Osiris, a central figure in the ancient Egyptian mythology and belief system. Osiris held significant power and was seen as a key player in the cycles of life, death, and the afterlife. Egyptians revered Osiris as the god of transition, regeneration, and resurrection.  Osiris was first recognized during the earliest periods of Egyptian history, as far back as the Fifth Dynasty, circa 2400 BCE. Over time, his story and imagery became an essential aspect of Egyptian religion. Osiris was typically depicted as a mummified man with green or black skin, signifying his association with fertility, growth, and resurrection. He wore the atef crown, consisting of tall white feathers surrounded by a pair of tightly curled ram's horns, and held significant attributes such as the crook and flail, which symbolized his authority over life and death. Osiris was the first son of Geb (the god of the earth) and Nut (the goddess of the sky). His siblings included Isis, Nephthys, and Seth. Osiris was believed to have been married to his sister, Isis, and together, they ruled Egypt. The story goes that Osiris was a wise and just ruler, teaching the people about agriculture, animal husbandry, and the principles of justice and order.  However, his brother Seth, the god of chaos and violence, grew jealous and determined to usurp the throne. Seth murdered Osiris by tricking him into a coffin, which he then sealed and threw into the Nile. Isis, with the aid of her sister Nephthys, searched for and found Osiris's body, but Seth discovered them and chopped Osiris's body into fourteen pieces, scattering them across Egypt. Isis then embarked on a quest to recover all of the pieces, during which she managed to reassemble Osiris's body, save for one part (his phallus) which had been eaten by a fish. Despite this, with the help of Thoth, Anubis, and other gods, Isis managed to revive Osiris for a brief period, which was just enough time for her to conceive their son, Horus. Osiris could not return to the world of the living due to his incomplete state, and instead, became the ruler of the underworld. In this new capacity, he reigned over the realm of the dead and judged the souls of the deceased. The ancient Egyptians believed that those deemed worthy by Osiris would be granted eternal life and peace, while those found unworthy would be subjected to torment and suffering. The afterlife's success was not guaranteed; it required an intimate knowledge of the right spells, rituals, and specific ethical behaviors that Osiris valued. Osiris was a major figure in ancient Egyptian funerary rites, as evidenced in the \\"Book of the Dead\\" and other funerary texts. He was often invoked to guide and protect the souls of the dead as they made their journey towards the afterlife. His stories and mythology offered hope to the ancient Egyptians, promising the potential for rebirth, life after death, and the enduring abundance of their land. In conclusion, Osiris was the god of the underworld in ancient Egypt, who played a crucial role in their belief system surrounding life, death, and the afterlife, as well as being a central character in their mythology. He represented themes of transition, regeneration, and resurrection, and eternally presided over the destinies of those who passed on from the mortal realm."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

But what can you do if your kids do not behave themselves at the dinner tables? The following are seven tips to set your children on the road to good table manners: *Look for the good. Instead of pointing out all the things your children do wrong, point out what they do right. Please say, for example, \\"I am so proud of you. It was wonderful the way you served yourself.\\" *Don't turn dinner into an unpleasant \\"lecture time\\". That will turn kids off not only manners, but dinner, and you, too. *Check your own example. Don't show up for dinner in just your underwear   unless you want your kids to do the same. *Don't always consider your kids lazy and dirty ones. Instead, point out the behavior in a tender way. For example: \\" It' s a good idea to unfold your napkin, so if food falls you won't dirty your clothes.\\" *Teach your kids good manners in the form of a game. One night a week, try to have a formal dinner. Try dressing up, serve a special meal, and expect more formal manners. That will help improve their sense of manners. *Make kids understand part of the tradition. Invite guests over and let kids help serve them. This helps them indirectly learn about table manners. *Try dining out once in a while. Fast food restaurants aren't counted. Try a nice restaurant and let kids order their own food, pay the bill and give the tip.

Joseph Caputo scaled a fence on the North Lawn at 2:45 p.m., according to Secret Service spokesperson Robert Hoback. The jumper was immediately apprehended and taken into custody.      According to two CNN photojournalists who witnessed the incident, the men was carrying an envelope, had on a blue shirt and white pants and was cloaked in an American flag. They said the officers who detained him had their guns drawn and were accompanied by K-9 units.      Vanessa Pena, an intern on Capitol Hill, was playing tourist with her twin sister who was in town for Thanksgiving. \\"We were just standing there and the man came up behind us,\\" she told CNN. \\"I heard him take a deep breath and say, 'All right, let's do this.'\\"      Pena said the man \\"ran through\\" she and her sister before he jumped over a barricade, and then the fence. ||||| A man wearing an American flag and carrying a binder in his mouth was arrested after he jumped the fence at the White House Thursday afternoon, police said.      Uniformed officers from the U.S. Secret Service quickly apprehended Joseph Caputo, of Stamford, Connecticut, on the North Lawn about 2:45 p.m., as the first family spent the Thanksgiving holiday inside the White House.      “Even though it was a national holiday, the Secret Service showed it could move quickly to apprehend a fence jumper,” House Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.) said in a statement. “However, the failure of the new White House perimeter fence, despite its recent modifications with spikes, is both baffling and discouraging.\\"      Norton, a senior member of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said she and other members of Congress were shown samples of the spikes bolted to the taller fence in the summer and were assured no one would be able to jump the enhanced fence.

Meagan Fitzgerald reports. (Published Friday, Nov. 27, 2015)      Caputo was the first person to jump the fence since the spikes were installed.      Victoria Pena of Houston said the man was standing with other people visiting the White House compound when he rushed toward the fence carrying what appeared to be a binder.      \\"I just heard him take a big, deep breath and whisper to himself, \`All right, let's do this,' and he took off,'' Pena said. \\"It was chaotic. Everyone around us was yelling, and kids were crying. It was pretty unexpected.\\"      \\"Casually, I'm just there taking pictures and I see a ninja coming through, climbing,” witness Amar Marwaha of London told News4.      Security personnel and guard dogs ran toward the man and he lay on the grass awaiting them, Pena said.      Charges are pending.      Man Draped in American Flag Jumps White House Fence      A man wrapped in an American flag jumped the fence at the White House but was quickly taken into custody. (Published Thursday, Nov. 26, 2015)      The White House was locked down until about 6:30 p.m.      The Secret Service also is investigating a 2003 Ford Taurus with Connecticut license plates with \\"Caputs\\" on them that was parked more than three miles away from the White House at Hains Point. Law enforcement sources said it's Caputo's car.      It was the seventh time in two years someone has jumped the White House fence. The most serious incident was in September 2014, when Omar Gonzalez made it all the way into the White House carrying a knife. About a month later, Dominic Adesanya scaled the perimeter before the K9s took him down. Then in April, Jerome Hunt took a bus from California just to jump the fence in D.C.      The National Park Service is in the process of enhancing security around the White House. Permanent changes to the White House fence and checkpoints are expected in fall 2016.      Norton will ask for a meeting with Secret Service officers early next week.

Answer the following question: -  Liver also cleans blood that has just been enriched with vitamins and minerals during digestion - Liver processes the good stuff into forms that the rest of the body can use - Waste or stuff your body doesn't need can be carried by bile back into the intestine or into the kidneys - The liver also produces a digestive juice called bile that helps the body absorb fat into the bloodstream - The liver also stores extra carbohydrates as glycogen for the body to use as fuel when needed.  What might be the first step of the process? Answer:","output":"The first step of the process in which the liver plays its vital role in digestion, detoxification, and storage of essential nutrients can be broadly described as the receipt and filtration of blood enriched with vitamins and minerals from the digestive tract. This crucial initial process can be further broken down into the following sub-steps: 1. Absorption of nutrients in the digestive tract: The initial stage begins in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. When we consume food, it gets broken down into smaller components like carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, and minerals. This process of breaking down food is called digestion. As the food continues to pass through the small intestine, the vital nutrients are absorbed through the intestinal walls and enter the bloodstream. 2. Transport of blood to the liver: Once the nutrients have entered into the bloodstream, they are transported directly to the liver via the hepatic portal vein. The hepatic portal vein is a blood vessel that carries blood from the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, spleen, and pancreas to the liver. 3. Blood filtration by the liver: As the blood enriched with nutrients reaches the liver, the process of filtration begins. The liver primarily acts as a purification station for the blood. It removes any toxic substances or harmful byproducts that might have entered the bloodstream during digestion. The liver also metabolizes drugs or other foreign substances, breaking them down into forms that can be more easily excreted from the body. In summary, the first step of the liver's role in digestion, detoxification, and storage of essential nutrients is the receipt and filtration of blood enriched with vitamins and minerals from the digestive tract, primarily through the hepatic portal vein. This step ensures that the liver can process the good nutrients for the rest of the body, produce bile to aid in fat absorption, and store extra carbohydrates as glycogen for future energy needs, all while discarding waste materials and detoxifying the blood."},{"instruction":"As animals grow their bones get longer and bigger, they grow more hair, and are able to take care of themselves by getting food, shelter, and water.

Hanson is an American pop rock band from Tulsa, Oklahoma, United States, formed by brothers Isaac (guitar, bass, piano, vocals), Taylor (keyboards, piano, guitar, drums, vocals), and Zac (drums, piano, guitar, vocals). Supporting members include Dimitrius Collins (keyboards, guitar), and Andrew Perusi (bass) who have toured and performed live with the band since 2007. They are best known for the 1997 hit song \\"MMMBop\\" from their debut album released through Mercury, Polygram, Middle of Nowhere, which earned three Grammy nominations. Despite the enormous commercial success of Middle of Nowhere, the band suffered from the merger that eliminated their label, Mercury Records . Middle of Nowhere was released in the US on May 6, 1997, selling 10 million copies worldwide. May 6 was declared 'Hanson Day' in Tulsa by Oklahoma's then-governor Frank Keating. Although 'Hanson Day' was originally intended to be a one-time occurrence, many Hanson fans all over the world still recognize May 6 as Hanson Day every year. Hanson's popularity exploded during the summer of 1997, and Mercury Records released Hanson's first documentary Tulsa, Tokyo, and the Middle of Nowhere and their Christmas album Snowed In in the wake of their success. Hanson also launched MOE (which stood for Middle of Everywhere), a fan club magazine that ran for 12 issues. After numerous unauthorized biographies of each of the brothers were published, Hanson turned to their close friend, Jarrod Gollihare of Admiral Twin, to write their authorized biography. Hanson: The Official Book reached number 9 on the New York Times Best Sellers List (nonfiction) on February 1, 1998. The band was nominated for three Grammy Awards in 1998: Record of the Year, Best New Artist, and Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal. During the summer of 1998, Hanson began a highly successful concert tour, the Albertane Tour. They performed a string of shows throughout stadiums and arenas in the US, targeting young audiences with a playful and energetic style. A live album, titled Live From Albertane, was released the following fall, as well as their second documentary The Road to Albertane.  In response to the demand for their earlier work, Hanson re-released MMMBop as 3 Car Garage, minus four tracks, in May 1998. To date, the tracks from Boomerang have not been re-released. Three tracks from Boomerang (\\"Boomerang\\", \\"More Than Anything\\", and \\"Rain (Falling Down)\\") and two of the remaining tracks from MMMBop (\\"Incredible\\" and \\"Baby (You're So Fine)\\") were released on the first MOE CD sent to fan club members.  During the Albertane Tour, Hanson wrote and demoed what would later become the songs for their second major studio album, This Time Around. During this time period, Mercury Records, the band's label, had been merged with Island Def Jam. Almost immediately following the changeover in May 2000, Hanson released their second album, This Time Around, but due to lack of promotional funding, sales were low and the label eventually pulled funding for their tour. The band toured through the summer and fall of 2000 on their own funds. Entity:","output":"This text is about Hanson, an American pop rock band from Tulsa, Oklahoma.

We often speak of \\"Mommy's mommy,\\" and I find myself trying to explain the illness that took her away from us. They have asked if the same could happen to me. I have always told them not to worry, but the truth is that I carry a \\"faulty\\" gene, BRCA1, which sharply increases my risk of developing breast cancer and ovarian  cancer.

Once I knew that this was my reality, I decided to be proactive and to minimize the risk as much as I could. I started with the breasts, as my risk of breast cancer is higher than my risk of ovarian cancer, and the surgery is more complex. On April 27, I finished the three months of medical procedures.

Greg is eating a stalk of celery while Tony is eating out of a bowl of candy. Tony remarks that he doesn't know how Greg enjoys such a bland snack. Greg just gives Tony an angry glare before getting up to go into the living room. On the living room table, Greg finds a glass of milk and a bowl of milk. The glass of milk has started to get thick, but the bowl of milk appears to be still fresh. Greg rolls his eyes at the mess and walks away.  Which person will experience more tooth decay? Answer:","output":"Based on the information provided, Tony is more likely to experience more tooth decay than Greg. This is because Tony is eating a bowl of candy, which typically contains high amounts of sugar. The bacteria in the mouth feed on the sugar, producing acid that can weaken the tooth enamel and cause decay. On the other hand, Greg is eating a stalk of celery, which is a healthier and less sugary snack. In addition to that, celery can help clean the teeth by increasing saliva production, which can help neutralize the acid produced by bacteria. As for the milk, it contains calcium and phosphorus that can help strengthen the teeth. However, it's worth noting that milk also contains lactose, a type of sugar that can contribute to tooth decay, but at a lesser extent than the sugar found in candy. Since Greg only found the milk but didn't consume it, this factor doesn't affect the comparison between Tony and Greg in terms of tooth decay."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

WWII veteran Delbert Belton, 89, died Thursday after being beaten to death by two black teenagers. Just this week, Christopher Lane was gunned down by three black teenagers. When is the MSM going to wake up to the terror of black on white crime?      The only crime that matters to the MSM is white on black crime. The primary example being George Zimmerman, a Hispanic, shooting Trayvon Martin in self-defense. But Zimmerman was light enough to pass for white, so it worked. Mission accomplished. But the MSM is ignoring the rampant, calculated attack on whites by blacks that have occurred recently.      On Wednesday, WWII veteran Delbert Belton was viciously attacked by two black teenagers, between the ages of 16 and 19. He was confronted in a parking lot across from Eagles Lodge in Spokane, Washington and jumped in the parking lot. He was mauled by his attackers and left for dead. He succumbed to his injuries Thursday morning.      Where is the outrage for Delbert Belton? Where are the race baiters, never ones to shy away from an opportunity for some time in the bright lights of the national spotlight?      They’re gone. Silent. This is the wrong kind of crime. Race baiters only show up when the black man is the victim. Which in the case of George Zimmerman, the truth is Zimmerman was the victim, but the truth never will help keep the spirit of racism alive and well.      The Al Sharpton’s and Jesse Jackson’s of the world need perceived “racism” to prosper from the idea of black inferiority. They need someone to blame for the horrific problems within the black community. Taking individual responsibility is not possible. No one profits monetarily from it. And keeping the black man down only props the race baiters up. It’s all about power.      But Delbert Belton was an innocent man, a veteran. He had been shot in the leg at Okinawa. He’s a hero, and he died in the most savage way possible. He was targeted by two young black men, who knew he was elderly, and they ravaged him. There is no greater horror than this, for a young person to viciously attack an elderly man.      Now who’s crying racism? Thank God for actor James Woods and his tireless twitter campaign to get the Delbert Belton tragedy in the forefront of media attention.      #DelbertBelton. Please RT. Don't let him die without anyone caring. — James Woods (@RealJamesWoods) August 23, 2013      And for calling out bigots.      If people use bigoted references re African Americans, they are rightfully summarily discharged from networks. Why is Sharpton exempt? — James Woods (@RealJamesWoods) August 22, 2013      Amen to that. The death of Delbert Belton, a veteran, is one that should never go unnoticed by the public. But it will by bigots like Al Sharpton. The horrors of racial crime have been outrageous this week, with the senseless and shocking death of Christopher Lane in Oklahoma on Monday. The 22-year-old college student was out jogging when he was followed and shot by three black teenagers who were looking for “fun.”      The shock and horror of this event is more than one can bear. But look at the “thug” culture, the predominately young black male persona. Gangsta life is glorified and with it death. Christopher Lane and Delbert Belton died because of it.      Where are our leaders to hold young black men accountable? Where is our President to call out members of his own community to aim for higher standards, to shape up? Our leaders are hustlers and pimps. How can we expect them to want anyone in their community to strive for anything better?      This is a tweet from Jesse Jackson himself about the Christopher Lane murder.      Praying for the family of Chris Lane. This senseless violence is frowned upon and the justice system must prevail. — Rev Jesse Jackson Sr (@RevJJackson) August 21, 2013      Jesse Jackson, you are the slime of humanity, a bigot to the core. Blood is dripping from your hands. This kind of violence is frowned upon? That’s all he has to say. He has nothing to say about the shameful condition of the black community. And how this is not the white man’s fault.      We will never hear those words from the race baiters. They’ll continue to make worthless statements like this. This crime does not profit them. Delbert Belton’s death will be thought of no differently. All these men, and the ones after, will die in vain. They will die because blacks do not want to admit that their racism toward whites is deeper than anyone can imagine. And that the problems facing the black community today are not white people’s fault.      by ||||| Once again a crime has become a flash-point in the ongoing examination of the role of race and age in contemporary American society.      The victim this time was Delbert Belton, an 88-year-old World War II veteran who police say was beaten to death by two teenagers as he sat in his car outside an Eagles Lodge in Spokane, Wash.      On Thursday, news of Belton's death the day before had reached a few corners of the Internet.      By Friday, the tragedy had struck a national chord.      Drudge Report carried the the story at the top of its page. CNN’s Jake Tapper interviewed Belton’s daughter-in-law on \\"The Lead.\\" The Fox News program \\"Special Report with Bret Baier\\" touted special coverage of Belton’s death.      News outlets also reported that a 16-year-old boy had been arrested in connection with the killing and that authorities were seeking a second boy, also 16.      And in multiple cities across the U.S., the hashtag #DelbertBelton was trending on Twitter.

What, Belton's not black? — David Garrison (@dlgarrison) August 24, 2013      Many tweets compressed animosity toward President Obama and admiration for Belton's military career in one tweet, with racial tension operating as a subtext.

The film cuts to a house where a man, Edy Rodriguez (Alfred Molina) is on a ladder nailing up a welcome home sign for Jesse. The woman, his wife, Anna Rodriguez (Elizabeth PeÃ±a) gives him a rather disgruntled look before leaving to prepare for Jesse's return. Edy then travels to his store, a small neighborhood supermarket, called Bodega. Along the way, and even in the store, Edy appears to be quite popular with the ladies. Back at the airport, Jesse finally meets up with his friend and cousin Johnny (Luis Guzman) and Ozzy (Jay Hernandez), who have come to pick him up. On the way to his fathers store, Jesse takes off his eye-patch to reveal that he can still see, but the area around his eye is badly injured. After some prompting from Johnny and Ozzy, he reveals that he was the lucky one, as his friend Lenny was not as lucky and Jesse feels some guilt for this. On the way, the three pass a park and Jesse tells them to stop. The park was their childhood playground and the three take a little time off to play a game of baseball and reminisce.

His basketball success was not immediate, and in fact he was cut from the school team in his first year. Later that year, he joined the St. Albans Lindens of the Press League, a basketball league sponsored by the Long Island Press, where he began to develop his basketball skills and gained much-needed experience. The next year, however, he was again cut during the tryouts for the school basketball team.  That same year, he fell out of a tree and broke his right hand. The injury forced him to play left-handed until his hand healed, making him effectively ambidextrous. In retrospect, he described this accident as \\"a fortunate event\\" and cited it as a factor in making him more versatile on the court. During a Press League game, the high school basketball coach saw him play. He was impressed by the budding star's two-handed ability and invited Cousy to come to practice the following day to try out for the junior varsity team. He did well enough to become a permanent member of the JV squad. He continued to practice day and night, and by his junior year was sure he was going to be promoted to the varsity; but failing his citizenship course made him ineligible for the first semester. He joined the varsity squad midway through the season, however, scoring 28 points in his first game. He had no intention of attending college, but after he started to make a name for himself on the basketball court he started to focus on improving in both academics and basketball skills to make it easier for him to get into college.  He again excelled in basketball his senior year, leading his team to the Queens divisional championship and amassing more points than any other New York City high school basketball player. He was even named captain of the Journal-American All-Scholastic team. He then began to plan for college. His family had wanted him to attend a Catholic school, and he wanted to go somewhere outside New York City. Boston College recruited him, and he considered accepting the BC offer, but it had no dormitories, and he was not interested in being a commuter student. Soon afterward, he received an offer from the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester, Massachusetts about forty miles (64 kilometers) west of Boston. He was impressed by the school, and accepted the basketball scholarship it offered him. He spent the summer before matriculating working at Tamarack Lodge in the Catskill Mountains and playing in a local basketball league along with a number of established college players.

Article: Burke's last publications were the Letters on a Regicide Peace (October 1796), called forth by negotiations for peace with France by the Pitt government. Burke regarded this as appeasement, injurious to national dignity and honour. In his Second Letter, Burke wrote of the French Revolutionary Government: \\"Individuality is left out of their scheme of government. The State is all in all. Everything is referred to the production of force; afterwards, everything is trusted to the use of it. It is military in its principle, in its maxims, in its spirit, and in all its movements. The State has dominion and conquest for its sole objects—dominion over minds by proselytism, over bodies by arms\\". Question: What did Burke think was missing from the French Revolutionary Government?","output":"Edmund Burke, in his Letters on a Regicide Peace, criticized the French Revolutionary Government for lacking the key element of individuality in their scheme of governance. He believed that the government was overly focused on generating and maintaining power through military force, rather than placing importance on the rights, liberties, and overall well-being of individual citizens. According to Burke, the French Revolutionary Government pursued dominion and conquest as its sole objectives, aiming to control minds through proselytism and bodies through the use of arms. This approach was fundamentally rooted in a military mindset, embracing principles, maxims, spirit, and movements that were inherently warlike and uncompromising. Burke was concerned that this style of governance would lead to a suppression of individual freedom and the erosion of the values that were necessary to preserve a just and democratic society. By neglecting the importance of individuality, the French Revolutionary Government, in Burke's view, undermined the very foundation upon which a functioning, stable, and prosperous state must be built. In essence, Burke argued that the French Revolutionary Government's disregard for individuality and its obsession with power and control would ultimately prove to be detrimental to the nation's dignity, honor, and overall well-being. He warned against appeasing such a system and its principles, as he considered this to be a threat not only to France but also to other nations that might consider following its example."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

TAPPITT IN HIS COUNTING-HOUSE.  Luke Rowan, when he left the cottage, walked quickly back across the green towards Baslehurst. He had sauntered out slowly on his road from the brewery to Bragg's End, being in doubt as to what he would do when he reached his destination; but there was no longer room for doubt now; he had said that to Rachel's mother which made any further doubt impossible, and he was resolved that he would ask Rachel to be his wife. He had spoken to Mrs. Ray of his intention in that respect as though he thought that such an offer on his part might probably be rejected, and in so speaking had at the time spoken the truth; but he was eager, sanguine, and self-confident by nature, and though he was by no means disposed to regard himself as a conquering hero by whom any young lady would only be too happy to find herself beloved, he did not at the present moment look forward to his future fate with despair. He walked quickly home along the dusty road, picturing to himself a happy prosperous future in Baslehurst, with Rachel as his wife, and the Tappitts living in some neighbouring villa on an income paid to old Tappitt by him out of the proceeds of the brewery. That was his present solution of the brewery difficulty. Tappitt was growing old, and it might be quite as well not only for himself, but for the cause of humanity in Devonshire, that he should pass the remainder of his life in that dignity which comfortable retirement from business affords. He did not desire Tappitt for a partner any more than Tappitt desired him.

Answer the following question: Information:  - A role-playing video game (commonly referred to as role-playing game or RPG, and in the past was also known as computer role-playing game or CRPG) is a video game genre where the player controls the actions of a character (and/or several party members) immersed in some well-defined world. Many role-playing video games have origins in pen-and-paper role-playing games (Including \\"Dungeons & Dragons\\") and use much of the same , settings and game mechanics. Other major similarities with pen-and-paper games include developed story-telling and narrative elements, player character development, complexity, as well as replayability and immersion. The electronic medium removes the necessity for a gamemaster and increases combat resolution speed. RPGs have evolved from simple text-based console-window games into visually rich 3D experiences. Since the 1980s, Role-playing is the most commercially viable video game genre in Japan, and has more market share of any other genre in the japanese gaming industry, although in the 2010s first-person shooters and western iOS and Android games were becoming rapidly and increasingly popular in that country.  - A PC booter, or booter, is a type of software for home computer era (early 1980s to early 1990s) personal computers that was loaded and executed in the bootup of the computer, from a bootable floppy disk, rather than as a regular program; a booter thus bypassed any operating system that might be installed on the hard disk of the computer. Video games were the type of application most commonly distributed as booters.  - Star Warrior is a 1980 science fiction role - playing video game written and published by Automated Simulations ( later known as Epyx ) for the Apple II , TRS - 80 , and Atari home computers . The game was branded as part of the Starquest series , consisting of Star Warrior and the otherwise unrelated Rescue at Rigel .  - Jon Freeman was an influential computer game industry figure of the 1980s and early 1990s. He was a co-founder of Epyx and Free Fall Associates and the spouse of game programmer Anne Westfall. Besides founding these two companies, though he is credited with some programming, Freeman is most noted as a game designer.  - A microcomputer is a small, relatively inexpensive computer with a microprocessor as its central processing unit (CPU). It includes a microprocessor, memory, and minimal input/output (I/O) circuitry mounted on a single printed circuit board. Microcomputers became popular in the 1970s and 1980s with the advent of increasingly powerful microprocessors. The predecessors to these computers, mainframes and minicomputers, were comparatively much larger and more expensive (though indeed present-day mainframes such as the IBM System z machines use one or more custom microprocessors as their CPUs). Many microcomputers (when equipped with a keyboard and screen for input and output) are also personal computers (in the generic sense).  - The TRS-80 Micro Computer System (TRS-80; later known as the Model I to distinguish it from successors) is a desktop microcomputer launched in 1977 and sold by Tandy Corporation through their Radio Shack stores. The name is an abbreviation of \\"Tandy/Radio Shack, Z-80 microprocessor\\". It was one of the earliest mass-produced personal computers.  - Epyx, Inc. was a video game developer and publisher active in the late 1970s and 1980s. The company was founded as Automated Simulations by Jim Connelley and Jon Freeman, originally using Epyx as a brand name for action-oriented games before renaming the company to match in 1983. Epyx published a long series of games through the 1980s, but nevertheless went bankrupt in 1989 before finally disappearing in 1993.  - Rescue at Rigel is a 1980 science fiction computer role-playing game written and published by Automated Simulations (later known as Epyx). It is based on a modified version of their \\"Temple of Apshai\\" game engine, which was part of most of their releases in this era. The game was released for the Apple II, IBM PC (PC Booter), TRS-80, VIC-20, and Atari 8-bit family.  - The Atari 8-bit family is a series of 8-bit home computers introduced by Atari, Inc. in 1979 and manufactured until 1992. All of the machines in the family are technically similar, and differ primarily in packaging. They are based on the MOS Technology 6502 CPU running at 1.79 MHz, and were the first home computers designed with custom co-processor chips. This architecture allowed the Atari designs to offer graphics and sound capabilities that were more advanced than contemporary machines like the Apple II or Commodore PET, and gaming on the platform was a major draw. \\"Star Raiders\\" is widely considered the platform's killer app.    What is the relationship between 'star warrior' and 'jon freeman'?

Write a summary based on this article: Ottawa - April 16, 2014 – The RCMP’s National Division Integrated Technological Crime Unit (ITCU) has charged a 19 year old London, Ontario man in relation to the malicious breach of taxpayer data from the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) website.      Stephen Arthuro Solis-Reyes was arrested at his residence on April 15 without incident. He faces one count of Unauthorized Use of Computer and one count of Mischief in Relation to Data contrary to Sections 342.1(1)(a) and 430(1.1) of the Criminal Code.      It is believed that Solis-Reyes was able to extract private information held by the CRA by exploiting the security vulnerability known as the Heartbleed Bug.      “The RCMP treated this breach of security as a high priority case and mobilized the necessary resources to resolve the matter as quickly as possible. Investigators from National Division, along with our counterparts in “O” Division have been working tirelessly over the last four days analyzing data, following leads, conducting interviews, obtaining and executing legal authorizations and liaising with our partners,” said Assistant Commissioner Gilles Michaud.      A search was conducted at the suspect’s residence and computer equipment was seized.      The success of this investigation reflects the collaborative efforts of the RCMP and other government agencies as well as the London Police Service.      Solis-Reyes is scheduled to appear in court in Ottawa on July 17, 2014.      This investigation was conducted as part of the ITCU ’s mandate to investigate pure computer crimes where the Federal Government and/or Canadian critical IT infrastructure are victimized.      National Division’s mandate is to focus its expertise in sensitive, high-risk investigations into significant threats to Canada’s political, economic and social integrity.      The investigation is still ongoing. The RCMP is committed to advising Canadians of any significant developments in this case.      - 30 -      Contact:      Cpl.

A computer was seized at the suspect's residence.      Mr. Solis is a second-year student at the University of Western Ontario. In 2012, he graduated from a London high school, Mother Teresa Catholic Secondary.      He was part of a team from his secondary school that came first in a programming competition at the London District Catholic School Board. He is also the creator of a BlackBerry phone app that solves Sudoku puzzles, which was released while he was still in high school.      Mr. Solis is the son of a UWO computer science professor, Roberto Solis-Oba.      Before moving to London, the family lived in Lafayette, Ind., where the elder Mr. Solis obtained a PhD in computer science at Purdue University.      Prof. Solis didn't answer an e-mailed request for comment.      Story continues below advertisement      Story continues below advertisement      The arrest came after the CRA said Monday that about 900 social insurance numbers were stolen from its servers. The CRA had shut down all of its public online services because of the Heartbleed Internet bug.      The CRA statement was one of the first disclosures by an organization that it had lost data to someone exploiting the vulnerability. However, the government has also come under fire for its handling of the threat and the speed with which it has acted to contain the problem. \\"There are many questions about the response and the timing of the response,\\" NDP MP Charlie Angus said in an interview. \\"We see a pattern with this government, which is to protect the minister rather than protect the interests of Canadians.\\"      The CRA won't say when the breach occurred: during the two years in which the bug went undetected, or during the 24-hour gap between the public revelation of Heartbleed's existence and the CRA's shutdown of its websites last week.      The CRA also declined to explain how it determined which SINs were hacked, since Heartbleed intrusions are hard to detect.      Internet security expert Mark Nunnikhoven previously told The Globe and Mail that the breach was probably detected through network monitoring from one of the federal government's agencies dealing with Internet security, such as Shared Services Canada or even the Communications Security Establishment Canada (CSEC).      While a Heartbleed breach would have left no traces of a data leak on the logs of CRA servers, it would have been spotted by network-monitoring tools that capture and analyze transiting data packets, he said. |||||","output":"In April 2014, a 19-year-old man from London, Ontario, was arrested and charged in relation to a malicious data breach from the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) website.

A:","output":"Both Edgar Cayce and Paul Solomon believed in the existence of the lost city of Atlantis. Atlantis is a legendary, ancient civilization that is said to have existed thousands of years ago. The story of Atlantis has captivated the minds of people for centuries and has become a part of popular culture and folklore. Edgar Cayce (1877-1945) was an American clairvoyant and is often referred to as the \\"sleeping prophet.\\" He conducted thousands of psychic readings, many of which were related to health and healing, but some also touched upon historical and spiritual topics. Among his numerous readings, Cayce claimed that the lost city of Atlantis was an advanced civilization that existed around 10,000 BC in the Atlantic Ocean. According to Cayce, the Atlanteans possessed advanced technology, spiritual knowledge, and psychic abilities. He stated that the city was destroyed in a series of catastrophic events involving both natural disasters and human actions that caused it to sink beneath the ocean. Similarly, Paul Solomon (1939-1994) was an American spiritual teacher, psychic, and healer who also claimed to have knowledge about the lost city of Atlantis. In his readings and teachings, Solomon shared beliefs similar to those of Edgar Cayce about the existence of this ancient civilization. For instance, he agreed on the location of Atlantis being in the Atlantic Ocean and spoke about the advanced capabilities of its inhabitants. Solomon also believed that the Atlanteans had extensive knowledge of energy sources and spiritual wisdom which enabled them to build magnificent structures. It is important to note that there is no concrete evidence to prove the existence of Atlantis; it remains a part of legend and speculation. While both Cayce and Solomon had dedicated followers who believed in their psychic abilities and the knowledge they shared regarding Atlantis, these claims are based on their personal experiences and visions rather than solid archaeological or scientific data. In conclusion, both Edgar Cayce and Paul Solomon believed in the lost city of Atlantis - an advanced ancient civilization which they claimed existed around 10,000 BC in the Atlantic Ocean. They both asserted that the Atlanteans had superior knowledge in various fields, including technology, spirituality, and psychic abilities, but ultimately faced destruction due to catastrophic events. Despite any substantial evidence to corroborate the existence of Atlantis, the intrigue surrounding this legendary city continues to fascinate people worldwide."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

They don’t mind talking about their personal life at work, but they hate talking about their work life when they are enjoying a weekend or vacation. But with blackberries and laptops, white people could be working anywhere, at any time. So how do you know when they are off the clock? It’s easy, check their clothes.      When white people aren’t working, they generally like to wear Outdoor Performance Clothes. The top suppliers of these garments and accessories include North Face, REI, Mountain Equipment Co-Op, Columbia Sportswear, and Patagonia.      When you see white people wearing these, it is important that you do not discuss business matters. Instead you should say things like “where did you get that fleece?” and “what’s that thing holding your keys to your shorts?” White people will be more than happy to talk to you about their sustainably produced possessions.      The main reason why white people like these clothes is that it allows them to believe that at any moment they could find themselves with a Thule rack on top of their car headed to a national park. It could be 4:00 p.m. on a Saturday when they might get a call “hey man, you know what we need to do? Kayak then camping, right now. I’m on my way to get you, there is no time to change clothes.”      Though it is unlikely that they will receive this call, White people hate the idea of missing an opportunity to enjoy outdoor activities because they weren’t wearing the right clothes.      If you plan on spending part of your weekend with a white person, it is strongly recommended that you purchase a jacket or some sort of “high performance” t-shirt, which is like a regular shirt but just a lot more expensive.      Advertisements ||||| The source. In the laundry, synthetic clothing sheds microscopic plastic fibers ( shown in the inset along with other plastic debris ) that make their way through sewage treatment systems and into oceans.      There's nothing subtle about dryer lint: Clean the fluffy, gray mat off the filter or risk a fire. Washer lint, however, is sneaky. Nearly 2000 polyester fibers can float away, unseen, from a single fleece sweater in one wash cycle, a new study reports. That synthetic lint likely makes its way through sewage treatment systems and into oceans around the world. The consequences of this widespread pollution are still hazy, but environmental scientists say the microscopic plastic fibers have the potential to harm marine life.      The existence of so-called microplastics in marine environments is not, in itself, a revelation. Larger bits of plastic, such as those in the infamous Great Pacific Garbage Patch, gradually break down into microscopic fragments. And minute plastic fibers have turned up before in treated sewage and on beaches. But no one had looked at the issue on a global scale, says ecologist Mark Browne of University College Dublin.      So Browne and his team recruited far-flung colleagues on six continents to scoop sand from 18 beaches. (The scientists had to wear all natural-fiber clothing, lest their own garments shed lint into the samples.) Back in the lab, the researchers painstakingly separated the plastic from the sand—a process that involved, among other things, hand plucking microscopic fibers from filter papers. A chemical analysis showed that nearly 80% of those filaments were made of polyester or acrylic, compounds common in textiles.      Not a single beach was free of the colorful synthetic lint. Each cup (250 milliliters) of sand contained at least two fibers and as many as 31. The most contaminated samples came from areas with the highest human population density, suggesting that cities were an important source of the lint.      Cities come with sewers, and Browne's team thought the plastic fibers might enter the ocean via sewage. Sure enough, synthetic lint was relatively common in both treated wastewater and in ocean sediments from sites where sewage sludge had been dumped. In all the samples, the fibers were mainly polyester and acrylic, just like the ones from the beaches.      Finally, the researchers wanted to see how synthetic lint got into sewage in the first place. Given its polyester-acrylic composition, they thought clothing and blankets were a good bet. So they purchased a pile of polyester blankets, fleeces, and shirts and commandeered three volunteers' home washing machines for several months. They collected the wastewater from the machines and filtered it to recover the lint. Each polyester item shed hundreds of fibers per washing, the team reports in the 1 November issue of Environmental Science and Technology.      A polyester sweater may seem cozy and innocent on a winter day, but its disintegrated fibers could be bad news in marine environments, Browne says. Other studies have found that microplastics in the ocean absorb pollutants such as DDT. And Browne's own work has shown that filter-feeding mussels will consume tiny plastic particles, which then enter the animals' bloodstreams and even their cells. If the same thing happens in nature, the plastic fibers could \\"end up on our dinner plates,\\" incorporated into seafood, Browne warns.      There is still no direct evidence that the fibers—pollutant-tainted or otherwise—harm marine life, but Browne says it's worth figuring out. He argues that the fibers are \\"guilty until proven innocent\\" and says that textile and washing machine manufacturers, as well as sewage treatment plants, should be looking for ways to keep the fibers out of the ocean. Garments that shed less lint, or filters that trap the fibers, might help.      ScienceNOW sent a copy of the study to Patagonia, one popular maker of fleece sweaters. No one was able to review the study and comment before deadline, but spokesperson Jess Clayton said that Patagonia does intend to follow up on the findings with Polartec, its primary supplier of fleece. ||||| On Black Friday, outdoor retailer Patagonia took out a full-page ad in The New York Times asking readers to “buy less and to reflect before you spend a dime.” Beside a photo of their iconic fleece jacket, the headline read: “Don’t Buy This Jacket.” And, while their message about retail consumption undoubtedly made a splash, there may be yet another reason to take a pass on that cozy, modern outerware. Besides Patagonia’s confession that the process of creating the R2® Jacket leaves behind “two-thirds of its weight in waste” on its way to their Reno warehouse — it turns out that tossing the jacket in the washer causes it to leave behind something else entirely — thousands of tiny plastic threads.      According to a study published in November’s Environmental Science and Technology, nearly 2,000 polyester fibers can shake loose from a single piece of clothing in the wash and, unfortunately, those tiny plastic bits are making their way into the ocean.      Ecologist Mark Browne, University College Dublin, and several colleagues gathered sand samples from 18 beaches on six continents for analysis. It turns out that every beach tested contained microplastics (particles about the size of a piece of long grain of rice or smaller). Of the samples collected, nearly 80 percent were polyester or acrylic, though without further research, it’s impossible to know exactly which type of clothing — whether it’s your stretchy yoga pants or that super-soft fleece blanket — is causing the most problems. Currently, textile manufacturers are not required to test their fabrics for shedding.      According to Science, “Not a single beach was free of the colorful synthetic lint. Each cup of sand contained at least two fibers and as many as 31. The most contaminated samples came from areas with the highest population density, suggesting cities were an important source of the lint.”      Charles Moore, founder of the Algalita Marine Research Foundation, which focuses on plastics in the marine system, says he’s been concerned about microplastics from all sources, including those body scrub microbeads that are as ubiquitous as the multi-blade holiday Remington razor this time of year. What worries Moore most is where those microparticles may ultimately end up.      Photo: epSos.de“Polyester is heavier than water and pollutes bottom sediments where most marine life lives,” he says. Once in the marine system, they get taken up by filter feeders like clams, mussels, and small fish like anchovies, sardines, etc., which are then eaten by larger fish.      That concerns Browne too. His work with shellfish has shown that once ingested by animals, microplastic can be taken up and stored by tissues and cells. This bioaccumulation of pollutants can have negative consequences for wildlife and humans.      Courtney Arthur, research coordinator with NOAA Marine Debris Program, says the issue is on NOAA’s radar, and expects research on microplastics and the effects on marine life to be a hot topic among scientists over the next few years. But for now, she says, the bottom line is still unclear.      “We don’t know the extent of injury at this point. We do know some marine animals ingest plastics, even down to mollusks like mussels and clams. We know it’s possible they could be accumulating in the food chain,” says Arthur. “All spectrum of marine life has the potential to take in these small particles, but at this point, it’s hard to say how much harm is being done.”      Although Browne and Arthur are cautious about making a direct link between microplastics and harm to marine life, there’s little disagreement that the recent increase in plastics pollution in the oceans is alarming. Several years ago, scientists discovered that plastics could break down at lower temperatures, leaking chemicals like Bisphenol A into the water.      So just how do we prevent the problem from getting worse? Moore says the place to filter the microfibers out is at the washing machine, well before particles move through the wastewater system and eventually into the ocean. So we contacted the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers to see if the industry had the capability of filtering microparticles before they reach the wastewater stream. Although their spokesperson did speak with Grist, they did not get back to us with a statement.      While Browne’s study focuses on the washing machine, Arthur also points out that simply wearing synthetic garments can also cause shedding.      He hopes designers of clothing and washing machines will focus on ways to reduce the release of fibers, and says further research is needed to develop methods for removing microplastic from sewage.      “Both government and industry need to work with us to determine the hazards natural and synthetic fibers pose for the health of humans and wildlife, so we can choose fibers that pose less of a risk,” says Browne.      So with months of bone chilling weather ahead, are you willing to swap your super soft fleece for something more sustainable? We asked both Browne and Arthur if they still own synthetics, and both said yes.      “I have some fleece, but with this type of research on our radar, I think twice before wearing it,” said Arthur.

Generate a question that has the following answer:  telescope  for the following movie plot:  Mala (Evan Rachel Wood) and her friend Senn (Justin Long) are young alien creatures who live on Terra, a planet from a star system in the Milky Way. Terra is a peaceful planet of alien creatures who have a rich semi-advanced culture. One day a large, mysterious object blocks the Terrian sun, piquing the Terrians' interest. However, since the Terrian culture bans the development of new technologies, such as telescopes, without the approval of the ruling council, none of the inhabitants are able to get a closer look at the huge object in their sky. Mala, who is inventive and headstrong, goes against the rules of her community and creates a telescope, which she takes out into the dark empty area outside the Terrian city and uses to view the object and witnesses smaller objects coming from the large object that turn out to be incoming scout spaceships. She returns to the city to find that the scout spaceships have already started abducting Terrians (who willingly offer themselves to the scout spaceships mistaking them as their new \\"gods\\"). After Mala's own father, Roven (Dennis Quaid) is abducted she goads a ship into tailing her and lures it into a trap, which causes it to crash. Afterward, she saves the life of the pilot, revealed to be a human, an officer named Lieutenant Jim Stanton (Luke Wilson). After his personal robot assistant named Giddy (David Cross) warns Mala that Stanton will die without a supply of oxygen (which the Terrian atmosphere does not contain), she creates an oxygen generator and fills a tent with air containing oxygen so that Jim can breathe, and eventually convinces Giddy to teach her human language. The Robot informs Mala that the mysterious object is a generation ship called The Ark, containing humans from Earth. Centuries beforehand, both Mars and Venus were terraformed by humans and colonized. But 200 years later, the two planets demanded independence from Earth, which the Earth government refused to grant them due to the high demand of resources from the two colonies.

Desperately seeking peace and solitude from his previous chaotic life, he hopes to find solace in his new environment. However, not long after settling in, he starts experiencing bizarre visions of his neighbors playing soccer with a human head. Haunted by these horrific visions, Trelkovsky becomes paranoid and withdrawn. His work becomes increasingly macabre, reflecting the darkness that has pervaded his psyche since moving into his new home. As reality blurs with his imagination, he suspects there's more to his neighbors than meets the eye. Driven to the edge and tormented by the thought of a heinous crime committed in his complex, he begins an investigation to uncover the truth. Trelkovsky's relationship with his neighbors crumbles as his suspicions rise. Each interaction brings forth more questions, leading to disturbing discoveries about each resident - one is a disturbed war veteran, another a former psychiatrist with a troubled past, and a mysterious woman who has lived in the apartment for decades. With each revelation, Trelkovsky becomes more convinced that the human head is not just a figment of his imagination but a deeply rooted conspiracy among his neighbors. Lost in his obsession, Trelkovsky finally uncovers the truth behind his ghastly visions. The human head belongs to a previous tenant, a promising young soccer player murdered by a ruthless gambling syndicate. The neighbors, tormented by their sins, have kept it hidden for years, playing football with it as a twisted form of retribution. Their guilt-ridden and disturbed minds manifest as Trelkovsky's visions, a projection of their own troubled consciences. In the climax, Trelkovsky confronts his neighbors with the facts, forcing them to face their ultimate fears. A tense battle of wits and morbid confessions ensues, leading to the truth once and for all. Shattered by his discoveries, Trelkovsky must grapple with the darkness of his neighbors and the impact it has had on his own life. As the story reaches a crescendo, Trelkovsky has a chance to turn the tables and deliver justice, making a decision that will decide not just his fate but that of his neighbors as well. The Dark Soccer is a chilling tale of the ghosts within us and the power of the human mind to shape our reality.

The primacy of the Roman bishop is largely derived from his role as the traditional successor to Saint Peter, to whom Jesus is supposed to have given the keys of Heaven and the powers of \\"binding and loosing\\", naming him as the \\"rock\\" upon which the church would be built. The current pope is Francis, who was elected on 13 March 2013, succeeding Benedict XVI.  - Gaul (Latin: \\"Gallia\\") was a region of Western Europe during the Iron Age that was inhabited by Celtic tribes, encompassing present day France, Luxembourg, Belgium, most of Switzerland, Northern Italy, as well as the parts of the Netherlands, Central Italy and Germany on the west bank of the Rhine. It covered an area of 190,800 mi² or 494,169 km². According to the testimony of Julius Caesar, Gaul was divided into three parts: Gallia Celtica, Belgica and Aquitania. Archaeologically, the Gauls were bearers of the La Tène culture, which extended across all of Gaul, as well as east to Raetia, Noricum, Pannonia and southwestern Germania during the 5th to 1st centuries BC. During the 2nd and 1st centuries BC, Gaul fell under Roman rule: Gallia Cisalpina was conquered in 203 BC and Gallia Narbonensis in 123 BC. Gaul was invaded after 120 BC by the Cimbri and the Teutons, who were in turn defeated by the Romans by 103 BC. Julius Caesar finally subdued the remaining parts of Gaul in his campaigns of 58 to 51 BC.  - Charlemagne (2 April 742/747/74828 January 814), also known as Charles the Great or Charles I, was King of the Franks.

From 800, he served as the first Holy Roman Emperorthe first recognised emperor in Western Europe since the fall of the Western Roman Empire three centuries earlier.  - The French are an ethnic group and nation who are identified with the country of France. This connection may be legal, historical, or cultural.  - A town is a human settlement larger than a village but smaller than a city. The size definition for what constitutes a \\"town\\" varies considerably in different parts of the world.  - In historiography, the Western Roman Empire consists of the western provinces of the Roman Empire at any one time during which they were administered by a separate independent Imperial court, coequal with (or only nominally subordinate to) that administering the eastern half. Both \\"Western Roman Empire\\" and \\"Eastern Roman Empire\\" (or \\"Byzantine Empire\\") are modern terms describing \\"de facto\\" independent entities; however, at no point did Romans consider the Empire split into two, but rather considered it a single state governed by two separate Imperial courts out of administrative expediency. The view that the Empire was impossible to govern by one emperor was established by Diocletian following the disastrous civil wars and disintegration of the Crisis of the 3rd century, and was instituted in Roman law by his introduction of the Tetrarchy in AD 285, a form of government which was legally to endure in one form or another for centuries. The Western Court was periodically abolished and recreated for the next two centuries until final abolition by the Emperor Zeno in 480, by which time there was little effective central control left in the area legally administered by the Western Court.  - A village is a clustered human settlement or community, larger than a hamlet but smaller than a town, with a population ranging from a few hundred to a few thousand. Though often located in rural areas, the term urban village is also applied to certain urban neighbourhoods. Villages are normally permanent, with fixed dwellings; however, transient villages can occur. Further, the dwellings of a village are fairly close to one another, not scattered broadly over the landscape, as a dispersed settlement.  - A dispersed settlement, also known as a scattered settlement, is one of the main types of settlement patterns used by landscape historians to classify rural settlements found in England and other parts of the world. Typically, there are a number of separate farmsteads scattered throughout the area. A dispersed settlement contrasts with a nucleated village.  - The Rhine (, , ) is a European river that begins in the Swiss canton of Graubünden in the southeastern Swiss Alps, forms part of the  Swiss-Austrian, Swiss-Liechtenstein, Swiss-German and then the Franco-German border, then flows through the Rhineland and eventually empties into the North Sea in the Netherlands.

For example, the problem of factoring  - NP - hardness ( non-deterministic polynomial - time hard ) , in computational complexity theory , is a class of problems that are , informally , \`\` at least as hard as the hardest problems in NP '' . More precisely , a problem H is NP - hard when every problem L in NP can be reduced in polynomial time to H. As a consequence , finding a polynomial algorithm to solve any NP - hard problem would give polynomial algorithms for all the problems in NP , which is unlikely as many of them are considered hard . A common mistake is thinking that the NP in \`\` NP - hard '' stands for \`\` non-polynomial '' . Although it is widely suspected that there are no polynomial - time algorithms for NP - hard problems , this has never been proven . Moreover , the class NP also contains all problems which can be solved in polynomial time .  - In theoretical computer science and mathematics, the theory of computation is the branch that deals with how efficiently problems can be solved on a model of computation, using an algorithm. The field is divided into three major branches: automata theory and language, computability theory, and computational complexity theory, which are linked by the question: \\"\\"What are the fundamental capabilities and limitations of computers?\\".\\"  - Complexity describes the behaviour of a system or model whose components interact in multiple ways and follow local rules, meaning there is no reasonable higher instruction to define the various possible interactions.  - In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm is a self-contained sequence of actions to be performed. Algorithms perform calculation, data processing, and/or automated reasoning tasks.  - A computer is a device that can be instructed to carry out an arbitrary set of arithmetic or logical operations automatically. The ability of computers to follow a sequence of operations, called a \\"program\\", make computers very flexible and useful. Such computers are used as control systems for a very wide variety of industrial and consumer devices. This includes simple special purpose devices like microwave ovens and remote controls, factory devices such as industrial robots and computer assisted design, but also in general purpose devices like personal computers and mobile devices such as smartphones. The Internet is run on computers and it connects millions of other computers.  - Computational complexity theory is a branch of the theory of computation in theoretical computer science that focuses on classifying computational problems according to their inherent difficulty, and relating those classes to each other. A computational problem is understood to be a task that is in principle amenable to being solved by a computer, which is equivalent to stating that the problem may be solved by mechanical application of mathematical steps, such as an algorithm.

Until a few hundred years ago, not many people were taught to read, so there was a lot more reading out loud by the few people who could. To help those reading out loud in the old days, sign  known as \\"points\\" were added to pages of writing. Punctuation comes from the Latin word punctus, meaning \\"point\\". These points told readers when to pause  or take a breath, and what to emphasize . In Europe from the early centuries AD, these points were widely used although not everybody used the same points for the same thing.

Translation: Of course, it is possible that larger companies and the largest industrial lobbying groups represent themselves more efficiently, but small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) must be protected, as this actually represents the protection of citizens and taxpayers in the EU member states. The text discusses the importance of protecting small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the European Union because they play a significant role in safeguarding the interests of citizens and taxpayers. The text implies that, although larger companies and industrial lobbying groups might have more efficient representation, it is crucial not to overlook the needs and interests of smaller businesses. SMEs often form the backbone of a country's economy and play a crucial role in job creation, innovation, and overall economic growth.

Q:Process: - A person breathes in oxygen - The oxygen passes through the bronchial tubes to the lungs - The oxygen is moved into the bloodstream - Circulates through the body - The cells in the body exchange the oxygen with carbon dioxide - The bloodstream carries the carbon dioxide back to the lungs - The lungs expel the carbon dioxide through the nose and mouth.  Question: suppose the bacteria is virulent happens, how will it affect a GREATER amount of oxygen being delivered to the blood stream.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect A:","output":"A virulent bacterial infection could potentially have various impacts on the delivery of oxygen to the bloodstream, depending on the severity and location of the infection, as well as how it affects the body's overall respiratory and circulatory functioning. When an individual is infected with virulent bacteria, the body's immune system is activated to combat the harmful pathogens, which may lead to inflammation and systemic responses such as fever and fatigue. As a result, the individual may experience an increase in the demand for oxygen throughout the body to maintain proper functioning and fight off the infection. Considering the process of oxygen exchange and circulation in the body, a virulent bacterial infection, particularly when it affects the respiratory system, might impact the delivery of oxygen to the bloodstream in several ways: 1. Inflammation and congestion in the bronchial tubes and lungs: A respiratory infection caused by virulent bacteria can lead to inflammation and the production of excess mucus within the bronchial tubes and lungs. This can obstruct airways, making it more difficult for oxygen to be efficiently exchanged between the inhaled air and the bloodstream. This would result in less oxygen being delivered to the bloodstream (B: less). 2. Impaired alveoli function: The alveoli are small air sacs in the lungs where oxygen exchange occurs. If the virulent bacteria infect the lungs and cause damage to the alveoli, their ability to facilitate effective oxygen transportation to the bloodstream may be compromised. This would again result in less oxygen being delivered to the bloodstream (B: less). 3. Reduced lung capacity and function: In some cases, a severe lung infection can lead to a reduction in lung capacity and overall function, making it harder for the individual to breathe and for proper oxygen exchange to occur. In such a scenario, the amount of oxygen delivered to the bloodstream would also be reduced (B: less). 4. Inability to oxygenate blood effectively: If the infection is of a nature that it directly affects the blood or the body's ability to generate red blood cells, which transport oxygen within the bloodstream, the individual's capacity to deliver an optimal amount of oxygen may be impacted. In this situation, the delivery of oxygen to the bloodstream could be less (B: less). In conclusion, a virulent bacterial infection is most likely to result in less oxygen being delivered to the bloodstream (B: less), due to factors like inflammation, congestion, impaired alveoli function, reduced lung capacity, or inability to effectively oxygenate the blood. However, it is important to note that the specific impact on oxygen delivery depends on the severity of the infection, the location within the body, and the individual's overall health status."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

When rain falls on exposed soil, the force of raindrops can break apart the soil particles, while the water can also saturate the soil and wash away the loosened particles.

News article: Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump and his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, spoke for a second time on July 7 in a previously undisclosed discussion, the White House confirmed on Tuesday.      A senior White House official told CNN the discussion was \\"nearly an hour.\\"      The White House, in a statement acknowledging the meeting, contended it was \\"brief\\" and said Trump spoke with Putin through Russia's translator. The US translator at the dinner -- each country was only allowed only one -- spoke Japanese, the White House said.      National Security Council spokesman Michael Anton said no other staff were present for the discussion.      The White House statement said the conversation took place in full view of other world leaders and their spouses at a dinner hosted by German Chancellor Angela Merkel during the G20 summit. Trump was seated near Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Abe's wife, while first lady Melania Trump was seated next to Putin.      The White House said Trump went over to his wife and spoke with Putin near the dinner's end.      The discussion came after their scheduled, two-hour-long bilateral meeting earlier that day.      Russian President Vladimir Putin seen top right, next to US First Lady Melania Trump at a banquet during the G20 Summit in Hamburg.      The White House, in its statement, sought to downplay the significance of the discussion.      \\"It is not merely perfectly normal, it is part of a president's duties, to interact with world leaders,\\" the statement said.      The statement also disputed characterizing the discussion as a \\"second meeting,\\" but instead called it a \\"brief conversation.\\"      Trump responded to reports of the meeting later Tuesday evening on Twitter.      \\"Fake News story of secret dinner with Putin is \\"sick.\\" All G 20 leaders, and spouses, were invited by the Chancellor of Germany.

'Only the Russians will have a transcript'      US presidents at summits often hold private and impromptu discussions with other world leaders. However, the lack of immediate disclosure from the administration as well as Trump's own posture with regard to Russia raised significant questions following reports of the discussion having taken place.      John Kirby, a CNN diplomatic and military analyst who was a spokesman for the State Department during the Obama administration, said smaller, informal meetings were common and were often where \\"heavy lifting\\" could get done. But he also pointed out potentially problematic aspects of the meeting.      JUST WATCHED Tillerson says sanctions to remain on Russia Replay More Videos ...

Toward the end, the President spoke to Putin at the dinner.\\"      \\"No staff or Cabinet were at the dinner at all, for any of the countries,\\" with the exception of translators, Anton said.      Coons said Trump didn't bring a US translator and relied on Putin's, which the senator called a \\"basic failure in terms of national security protocol.\\"      Asked if there was any depth to the conversation, Coons said there was no way to know. ||||| After his much-publicized two-and-a-quarter-hour meeting early this month with Russian President Vladi­mir Putin at the Group of 20 summit in Germany, President Trump chatted informally with the Russian leader for up to an additional hour later the same day.      The second meeting, undisclosed at the time, took place at a dinner for G-20 leaders, a senior administration official said. At some point during the meal, Trump left his own seat to occupy a chair next to Putin. Trump approached alone, and Putin was attended only by his official interpreter.      In a statement issued Tuesday night after published reports of the conversation, the White House said that “there was no ‘second meeting’ between President Trump and President Putin, just a brief conversation at the end of a dinner. The insinuation that the White House has tried to ‘hide’ a second meeting,” it said, “is false, malicious and absurd.”      “All the leaders” circulated around the room throughout the dinner, and “President Trump spoke with many leaders,” the statement said. “As the dinner was concluding,” it said, Trump spoke “briefly” with Putin, who was seated next to first lady Melania Trump.      The dinner conversation with Putin was first reported Monday by Ian Bremmer, president of the New York-based Eurasia Group, in a newsletter to group clients. Bremmer said the meeting began “halfway” into the meal and lasted “roughly an hour.” The senior administration official said it began with the dessert course, but did not comment on its length.      (The Washington Post)      Pool reporters covering Trump noted that his and Putin’s motorcades were among the last to leave the event, departing within minutes of each other just before midnight.      Trump lashed out at the media for reporting on his undisclosed meeting with Putin, saying the “fake news” was “sick” and “dishonest.”      But the president distorted what news outlets, including The Washington Post, had reported, saying the story was about a “secret dinner” when in fact it was reported as an undisclosed meeting with Putin at a dinner of the G-20 leaders and their spouses. Trump also incorrectly stated that journalists knew about his meeting with Putin; in fact, they did not until Tuesday, when the White House confirmed that the two presidents met during the dinner.      In the first of two tweets, Trump wrote: “Fake News story of secret dinner with Putin is ‘sick.’ All G 20 leaders, and spouses, were invited by the Chancellor of Germany. Press knew!”      Trump then tweeted, “The Fake News is becoming more and more dishonest! Even a dinner arranged for top 20 leaders in Germany is made to look sinister!”      The dinner encounter appeared to underscore the extent to which Trump was eager throughout the summit to cultivate a friendship with Putin. During last year’s election campaign, he spoke admiringly of the Russian leader and at times seemed captivated by him.      Meeting each other face-to-face for the first time at the Hamburg summit, the two presidents seemed to have a chemistry in their more formal bilateral session, evidenced by the fact that, despite being scheduled for 35 minutes, it continued for more than two hours.      View Graphic How the Trump administration changed American foreign policy      But Trump’s newly revealed conversation with Putin at the G-20 dinner is likely to stoke criticism — including perhaps from some fellow Republicans in Congress — that he is too cozy with the leader of a major U.S. adversary.      Putin’s official interpreter provided the only Russian-English interpretation, the White House statement said, because the president was seated next to the wife of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. “Each couple was allowed one translator,” it said. “The American translator accompanying President Trump spoke Japanese.”      The only version of the conversation provided to White House aides was that given by Trump himself, said the administration official, speaking on the condition of anonymity before the White House statement was issued. Reporters traveling with the White House were not informed during the trip, and there was no formal readout of the chat.      The official Trump-Putin meeting, earlier in the day, led to confusion over whether Trump agreed, as Putin later implied, to accept the Kremlin’s denial of any wrongdoing regarding interference in last year’s election.      That meeting was attended by the leaders and their two interpreters, along with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov.      Tillerson later said Trump twice asked Putin if the conclusions of the U.S. intelligence community that Russia had meddled in the race were true, and Putin twice denied it, so they moved on to other subjects of importance to the bilateral relationship, including Syria.      Russia’s activities during the election, along with allegations that members of Trump’s campaign may have coordinated with Kremlin attempts to tilt the race in Trump’s direction, are the subject of investigations in Congress and by a special counsel.      In Trump’s own account of the formal meeting, he repeated earlier comments that another country might have been responsible for cyber-interference in the election. “I’m not saying it wasn’t Russia. What I’m saying is that we have to protect ourselves no matter who it is,” he told reporters on Air Force One as he returned from a visit to France last week.      “You know, China is very good at this,” Trump said. “I hate to say it, North Korea is very good at this.”      Trump also said that Putin was unlikely to have preferred him over Hillary Clinton as president, since his goals include taking international energy business away from Russia and building up the U.S. military.      The dinner at the G-20 summit, held July 7-8, occurred hours after Trump and Putin’s lengthy formal meeting. Leaders and their spouses were invited to a musical performance at Hamburg’s riverside concert venue, followed by an intimate dinner at which they were seated next to the spouse of one of their counterparts, rather than their own. Melania Trump was seated next to Putin.      Trump, who is among the newest world leaders in the G-20, remained at the dinner for the entire night. He was among the last to leave — after the host, German Chancellor Angela Merkel, had already departed. Pool reporters with the president saw Putin’s motorcade leave at 11:50 p.m., followed shortly by Trump, who departed the concert hall at 11:54 p.m.      Leaders who witnessed the meeting were “bemused, nonplussed, befuddled” by the animated conversation, held in full view — but apparently not within listening distance — of others present, Bremmer said by telephone. He said he spoke with two participants at the dinner.      One senior European official whose head of government was there played down the attention the Trump-Putin chat garnered, saying it was not unusual for leaders to circulate or “withdraw to a corner” at such private gatherings.      “Part of the rationale is the flurry of bilateral contacts that happen,” the official said. “I don’t find it a sensation,” he said of the lengthy dinner chat, although “maybe Trump and Putin are a little different” from other attendees.      The administration official said there was nothing unusual in a meeting with no aides present, noting that Trump met alone with French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris and held a one-on-one session, with no aides present, with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the White House.

REUTERS/Carlos Barria/File Photo      WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin held a second, previously undisclosed conversation during a dinner for G20 leaders at a summit earlier this month in Germany, a White House official confirmed on Tuesday.      The two leaders held a formal two-hour bilateral meeting on July 7 in which Trump later said Putin denied allegations that he directed efforts to meddle in the 2016 U.S. presidential election.      The White House official did not say how long the second meeting took place or what was discussed.      The second conversation between Trump and Putin took place during a dinner for the Group of 20 heads of state and their spouses in Hamburg, said Ian Bremmer, the president of political risk consultancy Eurasia Group, who was first to report the meeting in a note to clients.      Television coverage of the dinner showed that first lady Melania Trump was seated next to Putin.      Bremmer said Trump got up from his seat halfway through dinner and spent about an hour talking “privately and animatedly” with Putin, “joined only by Putin’s own translator.”      The lack of a U.S. translator raised eyebrows among other leaders at the dinner, said Bremmer, who called it a “breach of national security protocol.”      Trump is under intense scrutiny by Congress and a special counsel investigating Russian interference into the 2016 presidential election, and probing whether Trump’s campaign had ties to the activity. Trump has denied collusion between his campaign and Moscow. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","output":"U.S. President Donald Trump had an undisclosed one-on-one discussion with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the G20 leaders’ dinner in Hamburg, according to the White House.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please add spaces between words: 8CompleteabilitytounderstandJapaneseTVandnewspapers.","output":"8 Complete ability to understand Japanese TV and newspapers. The ability to completely understand Japanese TV and newspapers involves developing and honing multiple language skills, including reading, writing, listening, and speaking. Accomplishing this task will require dedication, practice, and a strong learning regimen. Here is a detailed breakdown of the necessary steps to achieve this level of fluency: 1. Learn the Japanese writing systems: First, familiarize yourself with the three Japanese writing systems - Hiragana, Katakana, and Kanji. Start by learning Hiragana and Katakana, which are phonetic alphabets and lay the foundation for the more complex Kanji characters. Once you have mastered Hiragana and Katakana, begin gradually learning Kanji characters, focusing on the most common ones used in daily life. 2. Acquire essential vocabulary: Build your vocabulary by learning basic Japanese words and phrases, often referred to as 'core words.' This will help you recognize essential terms when reading newspapers and watching TV. Flashcards or digital language apps can be handy tools for memorizing new words. 3. Grammatical knowledge: Japanese grammar is different from English, so understanding its structure is crucial for achieving fluency. Study sentence patterns and the proper use of particles, such as は, が, and を. Familiarize yourself with the various verb forms and conjugations as well. 4. Practice listening and reading: Increase your exposure to the Japanese language by regularly watching Japanese TV programs, movies, and news broadcasts. Additionally, read Japanese newspapers, articles, and books to familiarize yourself with the written form. Make use of resources like NHK Easy News, which contains simplified news articles for Japanese language learners. 5. Writing practice: Develop your writing skills by keeping a daily journal in Japanese, engaging in online forums, or exchanging messages with language exchange partners. This will help you gain confidence in constructing sentences and expressing your thoughts in Japanese. 6. Conversation practice: Strengthen your speaking skills by attending language exchanges, taking conversation lessons with native Japanese speakers, or participating in online language exchange communities. The more you practice speaking, the more natural it will become. 7. Develop specialized knowledge: Understanding Japanese TV and newspapers may involve becoming familiar with specialized words and phrases related to politics, economics, sports, etc. Read up on current events to expand your vocabulary and keep up with the topics commonly covered in newspapers and TV news. 8. Cultural understanding: Gaining proficiency in the Japanese language is not just about learning the words and grammar rules; it is essential to understand the cultural context. Immerse yourself in Japanese culture by learning about local customs, traditions, and pop culture to better understand and appreciate the content you encounter in TV and newspapers. By following these steps and consistently dedicating time and effort to your studies, you can develop the complete ability to understand Japanese TV and newspapers. This process may be challenging, but with persistence and dedication, you will achieve this level of fluency. Remember that even native speakers continuously refine their language skills, so continued practice and learning will be essential for maintaining and improving your proficiency."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

While you are taking your dog to the vet or animal hospital, apply pressure with a clean bandage or towel. If there is a foreign object in the wound, do not try to remove it yourself.   If the wound is not severe or bleeding quickly, you will likely have time to dress it before seeking vet help. If the wound is so minor that the dog is not scratching at it or paying attention to it, you may not even have to dress it. Just go straight to the vet. If the blood from the wound is coming out in spurts or is bright red, this could indicate arterial bleeding. Such bleeding can be life-threatening. Apply pressure to the wound and seek immediate help. Ask someone to help keep the dog in place so you can bandage the wound and wrap the shoulder. The dog should be standing so you can wrap the bandage under the dog's torso. If the dog is in pain, it may snap or bite. Even a typically calm dog can bite out of fear when hurt. To avoid this, consider using a muzzle or having someone gently but firmly hold the dog's head and neck forward while you dress the wound. If possible, before you wrap the wound try to gently clean it with a saline solution and a clean gauze or cotton pad. You do not need to extensively clean the wound at this moment. Simply flush out the opening with the solution. Dab the wound gently with clean cotton gauze. Then cut a cotton bandage to fit the size of the wound and place it directly on the open wound. Press down firmly with 1 hand to slow any bleeding. Consider wearing gloves to prevent introducing germs to the wound.","output":"In the case of a dog sustaining a significant cut or profusely bleeding wound, it is essential to seek immediate veterinary assistance. While en route to the vet or animal hospital, one should apply pressure to the wound using a clean bandage or towel. If a foreign object is present in the wound, refrain from removing it yourself.  If the wound is not severe or rapidly bleeding, there may be time to dress it before acquiring professional help. For minor wounds that the dog does not pay attention to, dressing it may not be necessary, and one should proceed straight to the vet. When blood spurts or appears bright red, this could signify arterial bleeding, which is potentially fatal. In such cases, apply pressure to the wound and obtain prompt help. As it is crucial to keep the dog stationary while addressing the injury, one may need assistance to hold and stabilize the dog. The dog should ideally be standing to enable the bandaging process, which involves wrapping the bandage under its torso. Dogs, even those that are usually calm, are prone to biting when in pain or frightened. To avoid this, use a muzzle or have someone gently secure the dog's head and neck. If possible, initial wound cleaning should involve a gentle saline solution rinse, accompanied by a clean gauze or cotton pad. Thorough cleaning is not required at this stage; simply flush the wound opening.

Answer based on context: Coming off their bye week, the Seahawks flew to Giants Stadium for a Week 5 duel with the defending Super Bowl champions, the New York Giants.  In the first quarter, Seattle trailed early as QB Eli Manning completed a 32-yard TD pass to WR Domenik Hixon.  The Seahawks responded with kicker Olindo Mare completing a 30-yard field goal, yet New York answered with RB Brandon Jacobs getting a 3-yard TD run.  In the second quarter, the Giants increased their lead with kicker John Carney getting a 29-yard field goal, Jacobs getting a 1-yard TD run, and Carney making a 33-yard field goal.  Seattle closed out the half with Mare kicking a 29-yard field goal. In the third quarter, New York pulled away as Manning completed a 23-yard TD pass to WR Sinorice Moss, along with Carney nailing a 35-yard field goal.  In the fourth quarter, the Giants sealed the win as QB David Carr completed a 5-yard TD pass to Moss. How many yards longer was Carney's average yards of field goals than Mare's average yards of field goals?","output":"Let's first find out the total yards of field goals each player scored and how many field goals each player scored. John Carney scored field goals of 29 yards, 33 yards, and 35 yards. Adding these gives a total of 29 + 33 + 35 = 97 yards. He scored 3 field goals. Olindo Mare scored field goals of 30 yards and 29 yards. Adding these gives a total of 30 + 29 = 59 yards. He scored 2 field goals. Now we need to find their average yards of field goals: - Carney's average yards: 97 yards / 3 field goals = 32.33 yards per field goal (rounded) - Mare's average yards: 59 yards / 2 field goals = 29.5 yards per field goal Finally, subtract Mare's average from Carney's average: 32.33 - 29.5 = 2.83 So, Carney's average yards of field goals were 2.83 yards longer than Mare's average yards of field goals."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Here's how I would do it step-by-step: 1. Decide on the shape and size of the bench: Before starting the project, it's essential to determine the desired shape and size of the garden storage bench. Consider the space available in the garden, as well as the intended use and storage capacity of the bench. 2. Purchase wood: Based on the decided shape and size, calculate the amount and type of wood required for the project. Select the appropriate wood type, such as pressure-treated lumber, cedar, or other outdoor-friendly wood options. Purchase the necessary wood from a local hardware store or lumberyard. 3. Cut the wood to size: Using the dimensions determined in step 1, cut the wood to the required lengths using a circular saw, jigsaw, or handsaw. Don't forget to measure and mark the wood pieces before cutting to ensure accuracy. 4. Screw the pieces together: Lay out the wood pieces according to the design of the bench. Pre-drill holes to avoid splitting the wood, and use weather-resistant screws to join the pieces together. Assemble the frame, seat, and backrest, followed by attaching the storage compartment or hinges for the storage area. 5. Stain or seal the wood: Once the bench is fully assembled, clean any sawdust or debris from its surface. Apply a coat of high-quality, weather-resistant wood stain or sealer to protect the bench from moisture, UV rays, and potential damage. Follow the product's instructions for application and drying time. 6. Install the bench in your garden: Place the completed garden storage bench in its designated location within the garden. Ensure the bench is stable on level ground, and secure it if necessary. By following these steps, you will successfully create a beautiful and functional garden storage bench. The first option provides a logical sequence of steps, allowing the wood to be cut accurately and assembled before applying the stain. If the wood were stained before cutting and assembling, there would likely be inconsistencies in the finish due to additional sawing and handling."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  Frida begins just before the traumatic accident Frida Kahlo suffered at the age of 18 when the wooden-bodied bus she was riding in collided with a streetcar. She is impaled by a metal pole and the injuries she sustained plague her for the rest of her life. To help her through convalescence, her father brings her a canvas upon which to start painting. Throughout the film, a scene starts as a painting, then slowly dissolves into a live action scene with actors. Frida also details the artist's dysfunctional relationship with the muralist Diego Rivera. When Rivera proposes to Kahlo, she tells him she expects from him loyalty if not fidelity. Diego's appraisal of her painting ability is one of the reasons that she continues to paint. Throughout the marriage, Rivera has affairs with a wide array of women, while the bisexual Kahlo takes on male and female lovers, including in one case having an affair with the same woman as Rivera. The two travel to New York City so that he may paint the mural Man at the Crossroads at the Rockefeller Center. While in the United States, Kahlo suffers a miscarriage, and her mother dies in Mexico. Rivera refuses to compromise his communist vision of the work to the needs of the patron, Nelson Rockefeller; as a result, the mural is destroyed. The pair return to Mexico, with Rivera the more reluctant of the two. Kahlo's sister Cristina moves in with the two at their San Ángel studio home to work as Rivera's assistant. Soon afterward, Kahlo discovers that Rivera is having an affair with her sister. She leaves him, and subsequently sinks into alcoholism. The couple reunite when he asks her to welcome and house Leon Trotsky, who has been granted political asylum in Mexico. She and Trotsky begin an affair, which forces the married Trotsky to leave the safety of his Coyoacán home. Answer:","output":"The full name of the man that hires the bisexual woman's husband to paint a mural is Nelson Rockefeller."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

What is the best way to: To cheaply sand curves with sandpaper. Available options: I. Wrap the sandpaper around a toy drum for a drum sander.; II. Wrap the sandpaper around a cylinder for a drum sander.; Answer:","output":"Answer: II. Wrap the sandpaper around a cylinder for a drum sander. Step 1: Choose a suitable cylinder Select a cylinder that matches the size and shape of the curves you want to sand. This could be a piece of PVC pipe, a wooden dowel, or even an empty plastic bottle, depending on the size of the curved surface. Step 2: Cut the sandpaper Cut the sandpaper into strips that are the same width as the cylinder's circumference. Make sure the sandpaper's grit is appropriate for the material you're sanding and the stage of sanding (coarser grit for initial sanding, finer grit for finishing). Step 3: Attach the sandpaper to the cylinder Wrap the sandpaper strip around the cylinder, ensuring that it covers the entire circumference. Secure the sandpaper in place with some tape or rubber bands. If the sandpaper strip is not long enough to cover the entire surface, you can attach multiple strips end-to-end to ensure full coverage. Step 4: Sand the curved surface Hold the cylinder with the sandpaper end against the curvy surface, applying even pressure as you sand. Move the cylinder back and forth in a smooth, controlled motion, following the curve's contour. Make sure to sand in the direction of the wood grain (if applicable) to avoid damage to the material. Step 5: Inspect and repeat if necessary After sanding, inspect the curve to check if the desired smoothness is achieved. If necessary, repeat the process with finer grit sandpaper to achieve a smoother finish. Using a cylinder for a drum sander in this method is cost-effective and versatile, as you can select a suitable cylinder based on the size of the curves being sanded and easily replace the sandpaper as needed."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: I have a new situation: Whenever Bill visited Tim's house, they couldn't see that many stars when stargazing . Tim lived in the city. The sky was much clearer at night at Bill's place, because he lived in a rural area.  But I can use this background: Astronomy is very sensitive to light pollution. The night sky viewed from a city bears no resemblance to what can be seen from dark skies.[78] Skyglow (the scattering of light in the atmosphere at night) reduces the contrast between stars and galaxies and the sky itself, making it much harder to see fainter objects. This is one factor that has caused newer telescopes to be built in increasingly remote areas.  What is an answer for this question: Where do they see more stars and galaxies, at Tim's or at Bill's? Answer:","output":"Bill and Tim are both interested in stargazing and observing the night sky. However, the quality of their stargazing experience greatly depends on the amount of light pollution in their respective locations. In this case, Tim lives in the city, while Bill resides in a rural area.  Astronomy is indeed highly sensitive to light pollution, as mentioned in the provided background information. When one observes the night sky from a city, the view drastically differs from what can be seen in a dark, rural environment. Skyglow, which refers to the scattering of light in the atmosphere at night, is a key factor in causing this difference. It diminishes the contrast between stars, galaxies, and the night sky, making it more challenging to see faint celestial objects. As telescopes become more advanced, they are often built in increasingly remote locations to minimize the effects of light pollution, thus allowing for clearer and more detailed observations of the sky. This fact further emphasizes the impact that light pollution can have on stargazing and astronomical research. Considering the given information, we can conclude that Bill and Tim would see more stars and galaxies at Bill's place, which is located in a rural area. The lower levels of light pollution and reduced skyglow in this setting allow for a clearer view of the night sky, enabling them to observe fainter celestial objects more easily. In contrast, Tim's city residence would be subjected to much higher levels of light pollution, significantly hindering their stargazing experience."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Da das komplette Programm für Bogen- und Rollenoffsetmaschinen getrennt durchlaufen werden muss, sind knapp zwei Tage anzusetzen, wenn mit beiden Maschinentypen gearbeitet wird. Translate to English English:","output":"Since the complete program for sheet-fed and web offset presses must be run separately, it takes almost two full days when working with both types of machines. In more detail, the process of using sheet-fed and web offset printing machines requires careful planning and execution, as the two types of machines operate on distinct principles and their capabilities differ from one another. Sheet-fed offset presses are designed to print on individual sheets, whereas web offset presses print on rolls of paper or other continuous web materials. Given that a complete program for both types of machines must be followed separately, it's important to allocate sufficient time for each. Two full days should provide ample time for operators to become acquainted with and effectively use both sheet-fed and web offset printing machines. During these two days, operators should familiarize themselves with the processes and machinery, ensuring that they thoroughly understand how each machine type functions. This includes learning the specific techniques and settings unique to each press type and becoming proficient in their operation and maintenance. Furthermore, the operators should use this time to perfect their skills in managing the various printing parameters, such as ink usage, plate handling, registration, and drying. In addition to mastering the operation of each press type, the operators must also learn to switch between the two machines, as necessary. This may involve coordinating with other team members to ensure a seamless transition between sheet-fed and web offset printing jobs. In summary, while the complete program for sheet-fed and web offset presses must be run separately, dedicating almost two full days of training allows operators to efficiently and effectively work with both types of machines.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Several years ago the Navy kept a studied distance away from the making of \\"Men of Honor,\\" a film based on the experiences of the service's first black master chief diver's struggle to overcome virulent racism. Ever eager to support films showing our Navy's best side the U.S.S. Nimitz and two helicopter assault carriers, with supporting shore installations, were provided to complement this engrossing tale of a young sailor's battle with uncontrollable rage. Some of the movie was shot aboard the U.S.S. Belleau Wood. Antwone Fisher wrote the script for Denzel Washington's director's debut in which he stars as a Navy psychiatrist treating Fisher, played effectively and deeply by Derek Luke. Fisher is an obviously bright enlisted man assigned to the U.S.S. Belleau Wood (LHA-3), a front line helicopter assault platform. Fisher can't seem to avoid launching his own assaults at minimal provocation from his fellow enlisted men. Sent to the M.D. as part of a possible pre-separation proceeding, Fisher slowly opens up to the black psychiatrist, revealing an awful childhood of great neglect and shuddering brutality. The story develops as Fisher cautiously but increasingly trusts his doctor and gets the courage to pursue a love interest, an enlisted sailor named Cheryl, played by a stunningly beautiful Joy Bryant. Fisher reluctantly engages with the doctor by asking long simmering questions but soon realizes he must seek the answers, however painful, in order to grow and move away from conflict-seeking destructive behavior. While all the main characters are black, this story transcends race while unflinchingly showing the evil of exuberant religiosity and concomitant hypocrisy in foster family settings. Viola Davis, a versatile actress seen in a number of recent films, is a picture of sullen immorality but is nothing compared to foster mom, Mrs. Tate (Novella Nelson), who in short but searing scenes would earn - if it existed - the Oscar for gut-churning brutality. Films about patient-therapist interaction follow a certain predictability (all that transference and counter-transference stuff) but the earnestness of Fisher and his doctor/mentor is realistically gripping. It's a good story, well told. Period. While set in the Navy, \\"Antwone Fisher\\" is not in any real sense a service story as was \\"Men of Honor,\\" an excellent movie that dealt with crushing racism directed against a real person. Nor is it truly a film about blacks. It's about surviving terrible childhood experiences and, as Fisher says, being able to proclaim in adulthood that the victim is still \\"standing tall.\\" The persecutors shrink in size and significance as a brave and strong young man claims his right to a decent life with the aid of a caring doctor. My only quibble is that Washington is a lieutenant commander but is addressed as commander. With all the Navy support people listed in the end credits, someone should have told Director Washington that his character, like all naval officers below the rank of commander, is addressed as \\"Mister.\\" Not a big criticism, is it? :) I don't know why this film is playing in so few theaters.

Even though the tweet is somewhat complex due to the mix of emotions expressed, the overall sentiment is more positive than negative. In the text, the Twitter user talks about two different books: \\"Whistling for Elephants\\" and \\"Great Apes\\". They also mention they cried as a result of being hormonal, but they don't specify it was because they found the books distressing or negative.  The mention of crying might initially indicate a negative sentiment, but in literature and film critique, intense emotional reactions such as crying are not necessarily negative. Readers often describe books that make them feel intense emotions as compelling, poignant, or touching. These kinds of emotions can make the experience of reading the book more immersive and memorable, contributing to a positive overall impression. Moreover, the Twitter user said that they \\"liked\\" the second book they mention, \\"Great Apes\\". This shows clear positive sentiment. They're comparing the two books they have mentioned, highlighting that they are \\"v. diff\\" or very different from each other. However, this contrast doesn't necessarily imply a negative sentiment towards either book. Instead, it offers more of a commentary about their distinctness. Given these observations, it's fair to interpret the overall sentiment of the tweet as positive. The user seems to have been emotionally engaged by \\"Whistling for Elephants\\" and expressed a liking for \\"Great Apes\\", suggesting overall positive experiences with both books. In analyzing sentiment, it's important to consider the full context and not focus on individual words or phrases. Emotional reactions, even tears, can positively reflect the impact of a book, and words like \\"liked\\" straightforwardly express positive sentiment.

She walks over to the pond to see if it has fallen in, when it appears on the other side. She goes over to pet it, when a hand grabs her and pulls her into the pond, before pulling the cat in as well. After this, a hard candy floats to the top, and her phone begins to scroll through various numbers.After the credits roll, we are introduced to Beth Raymond (Shannyn Sossamon), who is having a party with her friends Brian (Johnny Lewis), and Taylor (Ana Claudia Talancon). She goes to the door, and looks through the peephole, where she has a flashback to when she was a girl. She answers the door, and Leann is there.Beth and Leann go upstairs and Leann mentions that she was at Shelley's funeral, and that Shelley's parents were convinced she committed suicide. Beth tells Leann that Shelley went strange before she died. Suddenly, Leann's phone rings with an eerie ringtone. Leann tells Beth that it is not her ringtone, and delays in answering, because she sees it is from Shelley's phone, so the call goes to voicemail. She listens to it, and it horrified. Beth asks to listen to it, and it plays a recording of Leann talking about seeing things before screaming.

In this sentence, spaces have been strategically inserted between the words to make it more comprehensible and grammatically accurate. The original text is a single string of characters without any spaces between individual words, making it challenging to understand its meaning. By adding spaces, we have transformed the original text into a clear and meaningful sentence. Sunlight, as mentioned in the sentence, has different effects on different individuals. Some people have a positive response to sunlight, and their bodies produce more vitamin D when exposed to the sun's rays. This vitamin plays a crucial role in maintaining healthy bones, regulating the immune system, and aiding in cell growth. On the other hand, some people have a negative reaction to sunlight and can experience photosensitivity or sunburn. Photosensitivity refers to an increased sensitivity to the sun's ultraviolet (UV) rays, which triggers an abnormal reaction in the skin or eyes. This can result in rashes, redness, irritation, and itching. In some cases, individuals might even be at risk of developing sunburn, a painful inflammation of the skin caused by overexposure to UV radiation. Moreover, people with lighter skin tones are more prone to sunburns and skin damage due to the lack of melanin, a pigment that provides natural protection against the sun's harmful rays. In contrast, individuals with darker skin tones have more melanin and, on the whole, may be less susceptible to sunburns, although they can still experience skin damage from excessive sun exposure. It's essential that people are mindful of their skin type and how they react to the sun's rays in order to ensure they are taking the appropriate precautions, such as wearing sunscreen, sunglasses, and protective clothing and limiting their exposure to direct sunlight during peak hours. Personalized precautions and awareness about sunlight exposure can help minimize the risk of sunburns and long-term skin damage while promoting optimal health and well-being."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - An oblast is a type of administrative division of Belarus, Bulgaria, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia, Ukraine, and the now-defunct Soviet Union and Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. The term is analogous to \\"state\\" or \\"province\\".  - In geography, regions are areas that are broadly divided by physical characteristics (physical geography), human impact characteristics (human geography), and the interaction of humanity and the environment (environmental geography). Geographic regions and sub-regions are mostly described by their imprecisely defined, and sometimes transitory boundaries, except in human geography, where jurisdiction areas such as national borders are defined in law.  - Local government is a form of public administration which, in a majority of contexts, exists as the lowest tier of administration within a given state. The term is used to contrast with offices at state level, which are referred to as the central government, national government, or (where appropriate) federal government and also to supranational government which deals with governing institutions between states. Local governments generally act within powers delegated to them by legislation or directives of the higher level of government. In federal states, local government generally comprises the third (or sometimes fourth) tier of government, whereas in unitary states, local government usually occupies the second or third tier of government, often with greater powers than higher-level administrative divisions.  - Ukraine (tr. ) is a sovereign state in Eastern Europe, bordered by Russia to the east and northeast, Belarus to the northwest, Poland and Slovakia to the west, Hungary, Romania, and Moldova to the southwest, and the Black Sea and Sea of Azov to the south and southeast, respectively. Ukraine is currently in territorial dispute with Russia over the Crimean Peninsula which Russia annexed in 2014 but which Ukraine and most of the international community recognise as Ukrainian. Including Crimea, Ukraine has an area of , making it the largest country entirely within Europe and the 46th largest country in the world. It has a population of about 44.5 million, making it the 32nd most populous country in the world.  - Kobeliaky is a city in Poltava Oblast, Ukraine. Population is .  - Kobeliatskyi Raion ( Ukrainian :   ; translit . : Kobeliats'kyi Raion ) is a raion ( district ) in the central Ukrainian province of Poltava . The raion 's administrative center is the city of Kobeliaky , which has a separate administrative status within the oblast ' . Important rivers within the Kobeliatskyi Raion include the Dnieper and Vorskla rivers . The raion was officially founded on March 7 , 1923 .  - A school district is a form of special-purpose district which serves to operate local public primary and secondary schools, for formal academic or scholastic teaching, in various nations.  - A district is a type of administrative division that, in some countries, is managed by local government. Across the world, areas known as \\"districts\\" vary greatly in size, spanning entire regions or counties, several municipalities, subdivisions of municipalities, school district, or political district.  - A raion (also rayon) is a type of administrative unit of several post-Soviet states (such as part of an oblast). The term is from the French \\"\\"rayon\\"\\" (meaning \\"honeycomb, department\\"), which is both a type of a subnational entity and a division of a city, and is commonly translated in English as \\"district\\".  - The post-Soviet states, also collectively known as the former Soviet Union (FSU) or former Soviet Republics, are the 15 independent states that emerged from the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in its dissolution in December 1991, with Russia internationally recognised as the successor state to the Soviet Union. On March 11, 1990, Lithuania was the first to declare its independence, with Estonia and Latvia following suit in August 1991. All three Baltic states claimed continuity from the original states that existed prior to their annexation by the Soviet Union in 1944 and were admitted to the United Nations on 17 September 1991.

The administrative center of the oblast is the city of Poltava.  - An administrative division, unit, entity, area or region, also referred to as a subnational entity, constituent unit, or country subdivision, is a portion of a country or other region delineated for the purpose of administration. Administrative divisions are granted a certain degree of autonomy and are usually required to manage themselves through their own local governments. Countries are divided up into these smaller units to make managing their land and the affairs of their people easier. For example, a country may be divided into provinces, which, in turn, are divided into counties, which, in turn, may be divided in whole or in part into municipalities; and so on.

In this case, let's break down both premise and hypothesis to ensure that they accurately match: 1. Premise: Two men in black bulletproof vests.     Hypothesis: two guys in black vests. In the premise, we have \\"two men\\" while in the hypothesis, we have \\"two guys.\\" The terms \\"men\\" and \\"guys\\" here can be considered synonymous, so this part of the premise aligns with the hypothesis. However, there's a slight discrepancy in referring to the vests. The premise explicitly states that the vests are \\"bulletproof,\\" while the hypothesis only mentions \\"black vests.\\" It is important to include the aspect of the vests being bulletproof since it provides more information and context about the scene.  To accurately represent the premise, the hypothesis should be modified to: \\"Two guys in black bulletproof vests\\" 2. Premise: They watch something taking place to the right of the picture.     Hypothesis: look at something to the right. The premise describes the action of the two men as \\"watching\\" something happening to the right of the picture. In the hypothesis, this action is described as \\"looking\\" at something to the right. Both phrases convey the same idea: the men are directing their attention towards an event occurring to the right.

Tweet:@davebot5k too late   ::crying:: j/k :p","output":"The sentiment of the given tweet can be interpreted as a mix of light-hearted humor, sarcasm, and a hint of disappointment. To better understand the sentiment, let's break down the components of the tweet. 1. \\"too late\\": The phrase \\"too late\\" can convey a sense of disappointment or dissatisfaction due to something that has already happened or cannot be undone. In this tweet, it could be interpreted as a negative sentiment, suggesting that the person missed an opportunity or event. 2. \\"::crying::\\": The user utilizes the shorthand \\"::crying::\\", which can be understood as an emoticon or symbolism for expressing sadness or disappointment, indicating that the user is upset about whatever incident they referred to as \\"too late.\\" This intensifies the perception of negativity connected to the disappointment they're illustrating. 3. \\"j/k\\": Following the \\"::crying::\\" emotion, the user then indicates \\"j/k\\", short for \\"just kidding.\\" This abbreviation is used to express that the preceding statement was not meant to be taken seriously and was meant to be humorous or sarcastic. Thus, the tweet's sentiment starts to lighten up, and the disappointment mentioned earlier is now seen in a less serious context. 4. \\":p\\": Finally, the tweet ends with the \\":p\\" emoticon, representing someone sticking their tongue out. This emoticon is often used to signify humor, sarcasm, or light-hearted teasing. The presence of \\":p\\" further emphasizes that the user is joking and not genuinely upset about the situation.

Premise: Time 's education cover package says parents should get their kids reading at an early age, be involved in their schools, not castigate them for mistakes, let them find their own learning styles, and praise hard work and persistence--not just outcomes. Hypothesis: Positive reinforcement and early learning are beneficial to childhood development. Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","output":"Yes, the hypothesis that \\"positive reinforcement and early learning are beneficial to childhood development\\" is entailed by the premise provided. Let us break down the premise, connecting each of its components to the hypothesis. 1. Time's education cover package says parents should get their kids reading at an early age: This statement supports the idea that early learning is valuable in childhood development. Introducing children to the process of reading at a young age can provide them with critical language skills, literacy, and cognitive development. By familiarizing kids with reading from the start, it lays the groundwork for continuing development and educational growth in their formative years. 2. Be involved in their schools: The premise supports parents' active involvement in schools, implying that parental engagement enhances childhood development. When parents are involved, they can provide additional encouragement, support, and guidance that complement the educational infrastructure, essentially fortifying the learning experience. 3. Not castigate them for mistakes: The premise urges parents to avoid punishing their children for their errors. This idea highlights that positive reinforcement is an essential aspect of childhood development. Instead of focusing on the negative, parents should help children learn from their mistakes and transform their experiences into opportunities for growth and improvement. 4. Let them find their own learning styles: Acknowledging individual learning styles underscores the importance of personalization in childhood education. By helping kids discover the most effective methods and approaches, parents and educators can better cater to the child's unique learning needs. This principle connects to the hypothesis in that it promotes an understanding of the value of tailoring education to the individual child, leading to a more fruitful developmental experience. 5. Praise hard work and persistence—not just outcomes: The premise promotes praising effort and tenacity as opposed to merely focusing on the end results. By putting emphasis on the process rather than the outcome, parents and educators nurture resilience, curiosity, and motivation in children. This concept of emphasizing on the journey rather than the destination aligns with the hypothesis, as it demonstrates that positive reinforcement plays an integral role in childhood development. Based on these elements, it is clear that the hypothesis stating that positive reinforcement and early learning are beneficial to childhood development is indeed entailed by the premises provided. These ideas contribute to the overall well-being, resilience, and cognitive growth of children throughout their development both academically and emotionally."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: A major use for petroleum products is fuel for cars, trucks, airplanes, trains, and other vehicles. The chemical used are usually a mixture of compounds containing several carbon atoms in a chain. When the material is ignited, a massive amount of gas is created almost instantaneously. This increase in volume will move the pistons in an internal combustion engine to provide power. A jet plane works on a similar principle. Air comes into the front of the engine and mixes with the jet fuel. This mixture is ignited and the gases formed create a lot of pressure to push the plane forward. The idea can be seen even more clearly in the case of a rocket launch. The ignition of the fuel (either solid-state or liquid) creates gases produced under great pressure that pushes the rocket up.  Paragraph: Company A was a refinery and managed petroleum products. Another company, named company H, produced and distributed electricity using wind power.

Frank happily welcomes his brother and takes him home, catching up on old times. But his wife, Ida (Irene Papas), reminds him that \\"they're going to send someone,\\" suggesting that perhaps Vinnie is the one. In a flashback, Frank recalls better times in New York, beginning with Vinnie's homecoming from military service and subsequent marriage to Emma Bertolo (Susan Strasberg). The father of the bride, Dominick Bertolo (Luther Adler) is a Mafia don, as is the groom's brother, Frank. And among those paying their respects as guests at the wedding are mob leaders like Egan (Murray Hamilton), Rotherman (Val Avery) and Levin (Alan Hewitt), who are the equals of Frank and Dominick in the New York region's organized crime. These capos within the Organization meet as a board to coordinate their business. The majority becomes increasingly unhappy with Frank's position, as he seems opposed to every new idea.

It's cheaper to buy ice cream than make it ourself. Does this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment? A:","output":"The product review clearly conveys a negative sentiment. The reasons can be analyzed from multiple angles as detailed below: 1. Title and Initial Impression: The title of the review itself, \\"It's very bulky and more expensive than buying ice cream,\\" indicates that the reviewer was unhappy with their purchase. They have highlighted two of their primary concerns—bulkiness and cost. Using words like 'bulky' and 'more expensive' creates an immediate impression that the product did not meet the reviewer's expectations in terms of size and affordability. 2. Purpose Not Met: The reviewer had a specific goal in mind when purchasing the product—to make their own ice cream using raw milk. However, they mention that the amount of sugar and rock salt required was much more than anticipated. This highlights a discrepancy between the reviewer's expectations and the reality of using the product, which contributes to their negative sentiment. 3. Cost Comparison: The reviewer goes a step further in sharing their disappointment by comparing the costs of making ice cream versus buying it. They state that it is cheaper to buy pre-made ice cream than to make it themselves using the product. This point underlines the dissatisfaction they experienced, as their initial goal of using raw milk and potentially saving money or creating a healthier alternative was not achieved. 4. No Positive Aspects Mentioned: Another important aspect of this review is the absence of any positive remarks about the product. The reviewer focuses only on their dissatisfaction. If the sentiment were mixed or positive to some extent, we could expect some positive aspects or benefits to be mentioned. However, the absence of any positive remarks further solidifies the overall negative sentiment.

Movie title: 15 Minutes Movie plot: The film begins with Emil Slovak (Karel Roden) and Oleg Razgul (Oleg Taktarov) arriving in America. They were former criminals and, after getting out of prison, have come to the U.S. to claim their part of a bank heist in Russia (or somewhere in Czech Republic). Within minutes of arriving, Oleg steals a video camera from a Make-Your-Own-Movie establishment. They go to the run-down apartment of their old partner and demand their share. He doesn't have it so Emil stabs him and his wife to death as Oleg tapes it with the camera. The couple's friend, Czech immigrant Daphne Handlova (Vera Farmiga), witnesses the murders from the bathroom; but she escapes before they can kill her, too. To hide the crime, Emil burns down the apartment. Jordy Warsaw (Edward Burns) is an arson investigator and is called to the case. Eddie Flemming (Robert De Niro) is a much celebrated detective who is also called to the scene. Flemming is such a high-profile celebrity detective that he is even followed around by the local tabloid TV show Top Story. Everywhere he goes, the townspeople cheer him on. Flemming and Warsaw decide to help each other out and work the case together. While checking out the crowd outside, Warsaw spots Daphne trying to get his attention. When he finally gets to where she was, she's gone. Emil calls an escort service from a business card he found in the girl's wallet and asks for a \\"Czech girl\\". When Honey (Noelle Evans), a regular call girl arrives, he kills her but not before getting the address of the escort service. Oleg tapes the murder. In fact, he tapes everything he can, trying to be the next Frank Capra. Flemming and Warsaw investigate her murder and also visit the escort service. Rose Hearn (Charlize Theron) runs the service and tells them that the girl they're looking for doesn't work for her but rather a local hairdresser. She also mentions a couple of other guys who just asked her the same questions. Flemming and Warsaw rush to the hairdresser, but they arrive just after Emil and Oleg warn Daphne to...","output":"Answer: Oleg Razgul steals a video camera."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Is the following sentence linguistically acceptable? Tony has a Fiat to yearn for a tall nurse.","output":"To determine if the given sentence is linguistically acceptable, let's analyze it step by step: 1. First, identify the main components of the sentence. The subject appears to be \\"Tony,\\" and the verb is \\"has.\\" The objects are \\"a Fiat\\" and \\"to yearn for a tall nurse.\\" 2. Next, consider whether the sentence structure is grammatically correct. At first glance, it seems to have proper syntax, with a subject, verb, and object(s).  3. Now, let's delve into the meaning of the sentence: \\"Tony has a Fiat to yearn for a tall nurse.\\" In this context, \\"to yearn for\\" usually indicates a strong desire. The mismatch lies in the fact that Tony's ownership of a Fiat somehow leads to him desiring a tall nurse. This connection is not made clear, which makes the sentence semantically unclear or confusing.  As a result, although the sentence's structure is grammatically correct, its meaning is unclear, and its terminology is mismatched. This makes it linguistically less acceptable. A potential revision could be, \\"Tony has a Fiat, and he yearns for a tall nurse.\\" This revision separates the two ideas making them standalone thoughts and clarifies the sentence's meaning."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Two years before, she had abruptly ended their affair for reasons revealed later. Henry suspects Sarah is currently having an affair and is considering employing a private eye to investigate. Bendrix was jealous of Henry during his affair with Sarah and had tried to persuade her to leave him. If she has since started an affair with someone new after telling him there would never be anyone else, Bendrix wants to find out. Without telling Henry, he hires the investigator himself, at the same time as making arrangements to meet Sarah.Consistent with the tone of his diary, their meeting is cold and promises no future. Events are shown from Bendrix perspective, with contrasting flashbacks of Bendrix with Sarah as they began their affair during World War II. The present day action continues as Bendrix encounters the private investigator Parkis (Ian Hart), who uses his young son Lancelot (Sam Bould) to help him snoop. The boy has a birthmark that disfigures his face.Parkis reports that he has found who Sarah has been seeing under the pretence of attending dental appointments. Bendrix jealousy leads him to confront the man named Smythe, using Lancelot as a ploy to gain access to his home. Smythe (Jason Isaacs) is a priest who admits he knows Sarah and who Bendrix is. Smythe is affronted by the way he has approached him and tells him to leave.The climax of Act 2 is a night of passion during the war when we witness them making love amid the sound of V2 rockets falling and shaking the house.

Question 2: Is there a way to mute questions with certain keywords on Quora? Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","output":"Yes, questions 1 and 2 are essentially asking the same thing. Both questions are inquiring about the possibility to mute or filter out questions that contain specific text or keywords on the Q&A platform, Quora. To provide a detailed and long answer to address this inquiry, I will explain the current features and limitations of Quora's platform related to muting questions and suggest potential alternatives. Currently, Quora does not offer a built-in feature that allows users to mute or filter out questions based on specific text or keywords. The platform allows users to mute individual questions or topics, but not based on customized keywords. Here’s a brief explanation of these features: 1. Muting questions: When you come across a question on your feed or recommended questions that you are not interested in, you have the option to click on the three-dot icon next to the question and select \\"Mute.\\" This will prevent the question from appearing in your feed again. However, this has to be done manually for each question, and you cannot mute them based on keywords. 2. Muting topics: Quora also allows you to mute entire topics. To do this, go to the topic page, click on the three-dot icon next to the \\"Follow\\" button, and select \\"Mute.\\" Muting a topic will reduce the number of questions you see related to that topic in your feed. Again, this feature does not allow for keyword-based muting. While Quora's current muting options might be limited, you can still explore potential workarounds to enhance your Quora experience and avoid questions containing specific keywords. Here are some suggestions: 1. Customize your interests: You can edit your interests on Quora to include only the topics you genuinely care about. By following more relevant topics, you will receive questions and answers related to your preferences, reducing the chances of encountering undesired content. Click on your profile icon, select \\"Knows About,\\" and use the search bar to add or remove topics. 2. Use browser extensions: Some browser extensions or add-ons may be able to filter out specific keywords or phrases from your feed, essentially muting questions containing your selected text. Note that using such extensions may not be officially supported by Quora and could potentially lead to a less optimal experience on the platform. 3. Provide user feedback to Quora: While the keyword muting feature is currently not available, you can provide this feedback to Quora's team, expressing your desire for such a feature to be implemented. They may consider implementing it in future updates if they see value in it from a user experience standpoint. To sum up, questions 1 and 2 are indeed asking the same thing, and unfortunately, there is no built-in feature on Quora to mute questions containing specific text or keywords. However, by using the available muting options and customizing your interests, you may be able to filter out undesired content to a certain extent."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

We take buses instead of taxis. And we wear our old designer jeans just a few months longer. With college expenses at all-time highs, high school students are eager to do anything to cut the cost of a university education. One cost-cutting proposal is to allow college students to get a bachelor's degree in three years instead of four. Educational institutions have been actively exploring ways to make the learning process more efficient. But there's a question: Would the quality of undergraduate education suffer? Few US universities have formally approved a \\"three-year degree\\" model. I doubt that mainstream North American colleges will carry out a three-year curriculum   any time soon. For one thing, most universities already allow highly qualified students to graduate early by testing out of certain classes and obtaining a number of college credits. In addition, at famous universities, the committee who determine which courses are required and which courses are electives are unlikely to suddenly \\"throw out\\" one quarter of the required credits. Professors will resist \\"diluting  \\" the quality of the education they offer. In my opinion, a quality four-year education is always superior to a quality three-year education. A college education requires sufficient time for a student to become skilled in their major and do coursework in fields outside their major. It is not a good idea to water down education, any more than it's not a good idea to water down medicine. If we want to help students find their way through university, we should help them understand early on what knowledge and skills they need to have upon graduation. We should allow students to test out of as many courses as possible. We should give them a chance to earn money as interns   in meaningful part-time jobs that relate to their university studies, such as the five-year co-op program at Northeastern University. ks5uks5u We can learn from the passage that   _  .

Answer the following question: What is the final step of the following process: -  Forest fires burn forests - The animals living in the forest have fewer places to hide - Predators can now find their prey eaiser - Birds will fly away from the area Answer:","output":"The final step in this process, following the forest fires, decreased hiding places for animals, increased predation, and the departure of birds, is the ecological response and eventual recovery of the affected ecosystem. Following such a disturbance, the forest ecosystem goes through a series of changes, often called ecological succession, in order to reach a new stable state. This process can be broken down into various stages: 1. Initial colonization: After the forest fire, the affected area will be initially colonized by pioneer species – plants adapted to surviving in disturbed environments. These plants, such as grasses and small shrubs, grow rapidly in the exposed soil and take advantage of the increased sunlight and available nutrients. This stage helps to stabilize the soil, preventing erosion and further degradation. 2. Secondary succession: As the pioneer plants begin to grow and establish themselves, other species, such as larger shrubs and smaller trees, take root in the area. These plants provide additional habitat resources for animals to return to the area, creating a more diverse ecosystem. The increased plant cover helps to reduce soil erosion, eventually leading to improved soil quality. 3. Climax community formation: Over time, the ecosystem continues to develop and mature as more tree species take root and the plant community diversifies. The canopy grows taller, shading out some of the smaller plants and allowing for more shade-tolerant species to establish themselves. At this stage, the ecosystem has the greatest potential to support a diverse array of wildlife, creating a more balanced predator-prey relationship. 4. Stabilization and recovery: Eventually, the ecosystem will reach a stable state known as a climax community, where species composition and ecological processes are relatively constant over time. This community will persist until another disturbance event occurs, such as another forest fire, initiating the recovery process once again. Throughout this process, the affected ecosystem undergoes a natural restoration. Animal populations that were displaced during the fire will gradually return as the forest regenerates, provided that the habitat is not permanently altered due to human intervention or other factors. Bird populations may return to nest in the recovering forest and new generations will reoccupy the area. In conclusion, the final step in this process is the ecological response and recovery of the forest ecosystem, leading to a new stable state that supports a balanced and diverse community of animal and plant species. This process can take many years or even decades, depending on the severity of the disturbance and the resilience of the affected ecosystem."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Nash conceptualized \\"Single Ladies\\" after Beyoncé's secret marriage to hip hop recording artist Jay-Z in April 2008. Stewart commented that the song was \\"the only public statement that [Beyoncé and Jay-Z had] ever made about marriage\\", and that while in the studio recording the song Beyoncé had remained tightlipped, even to the point of removing her wedding band. Beyoncé's marriage inspired Nash to compose a song about an issue that affected many people's relationships: the fear or unwillingness of men to commit. In an interview with Billboard magazine, Beyoncé added that she was drawn to the song because of the universality of the topic, an issue that \\"people are passionate about and want to talk about and debate\\". She stated that although \\"Single Ladies\\" is a playful uptempo song, it addresses an issue that women experience every day.In \\"Single Ladies\\", Beyoncé portrays her alter ego Sasha Fierce, which appears on the second part of I Am... Sasha Fierce. The song was released simultaneously with \\"If I Were a Boy\\"; as lead singles, they were meant to demonstrate the concept of the dueling personalities of the singer. This reinforced the theme of the album, which was created by placing its ballads and uptempo tracks on separate discs. The singles debuted on US radio on October 8, 2008; \\"Single Ladies\\" did so on mainstream urban New York radio station Power 105.1. Both singles were added to rhythmic contemporary radio playlists on October 12, 2008; \\"Single Ladies\\" was sent to urban contemporary playlists the same day, while \\"If I Were a Boy\\" was instead classified for contemporary hit radio. The two songs were released as a double A-side... The answer to this question is:","output":"Beyoncé's songs were meant to demonstrate the concept of the dueling personalities. In particular, the simultaneous release of \\"Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)\\" and \\"If I Were a Boy\\" as lead singles was intended to showcase the contrasting personas of the singer. These songs represent Beyoncé's alter ego, Sasha Fierce, which appears on the second part of the album \\"I Am... Sasha Fierce.\\" By placing ballads and uptempo tracks on separate discs, the album reinforces the theme of duality in Beyoncé's character and artistic expression."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Can you tell me what it is? Answer:","output":"The answer to the question \\"What would come of this venture as a whole?\\" in the context of the given information is the creation of universities that would foster scholarly expertise and contribute to the overall development of society. The passage explains how rulers and city governments across Europe recognized the importance of knowledge and its impact on society. They understood that universities would play a crucial role in nurturing and refining the intellectual capacity of their citizens. As a result, they established multiple universities to satisfy the growing thirst for knowledge in Europe. Two key factors played a significant role in this venture: 1. The emergence of humanism: Humanism became an essential driving force behind the founding of universities. Humanism, a cultural and intellectual movement during the Renaissance, focused on the rediscovery of ancient Greek and Roman texts and promoted the importance of human potential and achievement. This newfound interest in humanist principles inspired the creation of universities that would provide a platform for the study and dissemination of this knowledge. 2. The revival of interest in ancient Greek texts: The increased interest in ancient Greek texts during the Renaissance period led to the rediscovery of valuable knowledge that had been lost for centuries. This revival of interest played an essential role in inspiring rulers and city governments to establish universities that would facilitate the study of these texts and enable students to learn from the wisdom and expertise of the ancient world. In conclusion, the venture of creating universities across Europe as a whole led to the development of scholarly expertise, equipped individuals with the ability to address complex problems and achieve desired results, and contributed to the prosperity and well-being of societies. The emergence of humanism and the revival of interest in ancient Greek texts played crucial roles in this venture, making universities significant institutions in fostering intellectual growth and shaping the course of European history."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer based on context: Hoping to rebound from their tough loss to the Giants, the Redskins traveled to Heinz Field to take on the Pittsburgh Steelers, and attempted to improve to 1-1 against the AFC. The Steelers marched straight down the field on Washington's defense, culminating in a fourth-and-goal 1-yard touchdown pass to backup tight end Leonard Pope from Ben Roethlisberger to give the Steelers a 7-0 lead. Following a Washington three-and-out, the Steelers got the ball back, this time scoring by way of former despised Redskins kicker Shaun Suisham nailing a 48-yard field goal to extend the Steelers' advantage to 10-0. In the second, Washington was able to get on the board as quarterback Robert Griffin III found Santana Moss to cut into Pittsburgh's advantage 10-6. It would have been 10-7, but Kai Forbath's extra point was blocked. Pittsburgh responded with a Heath Miller 7-yard touchdown and a Suisham 27-yard field goal to give Pittsburgh a 20-6 lead at the half. In the third, Washington drew to 20-9 on a Forbath 48-yard field goal, but Pittsburgh nearly put the game away with a Will Johnson 1-yard touchdown catch to give Pittsburgh a 27-9 lead late in the third. In the fourth, Washington tried to rally as Forbath connected again, this time from 45 yards, but Washington could not score again, as a myriad of dropped passes and a turnover on downs with just over four minutes remaining sealed their fate, as the final score remained 27-12. With the loss, Washington fell to 3-5, and 0-2 against the AFC. Washington has now lost 6 straight games to AFC opponents and has not beaten an AFC team since Week 16 of the 2010 season.

As one of the world's most in-demand models, looking good is the key to Jourdan Dunn's career. With countless catwalk appearances and major campaigns under her belt, Jourdan is clearly doing something right...so what's her secret? FEMAIL caught up with the Maybelline New York ambassadress to find out - and we discovered that an exhaustive eight-step beauty regime that takes her nearly an hour a day is behind her flawless supermodel skin. Jourdan Dunn is one of the most esteemed supermodels in the world so FEMAIL caught up with her about her skincare regime, diet and favourite fashion week moments. Sharing her 'hardcore' beauty regime, Jourdan told us: 'I visited Tokyo and became obsessed with their skincare, which is very advanced. Their regimes have loads more steps but I incorporated some of their techniques into mine and developed my own eight step regime. 'It takes me a good twenty minutes in the morning and then about half an hour in the evening.' The secret behind her flawless skin? An eight step skincare regime and lip balm as eyeshadow and cheek tint. Jourdan, who has been sitting front row at fashion week and is currently the face of Burberry, has picked up some quirky beauty tips during her time in the industry. Her favourites? 'Hold a credit card behind your lashes when you apply your mascara. If you press against the card you get a wide-eyed, curled effect without getting lots of product on your eyelid,' she advised. She also swears by using lip balm as an eyeshadow to give a 'glossy' finish (her favourite is Maybelline Baby Lips Lip Balm), and she often uses the pink tinted ones as blusher. Jourdan has been working for Maybelline New York since last April and gave the brand's new products a spin over London Fashion Week. (L to R) Pixie Geldof, Kendall Jenner, Cara Delevingne, Sir Philip Green and Jourdan Dunn attend the Topshop Unique show during London Fashion Week. When it comes to beauty, 24-year-old Jourdan, an accomplished cook who runs her own cookery YouTube channel, believes it's all about what you put in. 'I like to eat healthy,' she said. 'I love good greens and fish and I'm not really a snacker. 'Luckily the backstage catering at fashion week has improved. There used to be nothing or just really boring food but they've really stepped it up. Diane Von Furstenberg even had an amazing gluten-free buffet backstage at her show.' To keep herself sane amid the backstage madness, Jourdan swears by meditating, which she says helps her 'zone out'. She cites her favourite thing about fashion week as seeing her friends (a roll call of the coolest young models in the industry including Cara Delevingne, Karlie Kloss, Kendall Jenner and Gigi Hadid). 'I don't get to see my friends very often and travelling around the world for shows can be really lonely and boring so I love it when me and my pals are all together for a catch-up,' she said. Jourdan, seen walking in Naomi Campbell's charity Fashion For Relief show, is currently the face of Burberry alongside her fellow supermodel. The six foot clothes horse, who has been dubbed the modern-day Naomi Campbell, has been working as the face of Maybelline New York since April last year. Jourdan joined an elite group of models who have worked for the brand, including Christy Turlington, Adriana Lima, Erin Wasson, Emily DiDonato and Mollie King. As a  Vogue regular, who was scouted in Primark in her teens, Jourdan was on the road to success very early in her career. When she's not on the catwalk, Jourdan is a proud mother to her son Riley, who was diagnosed with sickle cell anemia.

When she's not on the catwalk, Jourdan is a proud mother to her son Riley, who was diagnosed with sickle cell anemia. This has led to Jourdan’s active involvement as the Parent Ambassador for the Sickle Cell Disease Association of America and the future is looking bright for the young starlet.

Today, we are going to talk about the second longest field goal in American football history. A field goal is when a player kicks the football through the big \\"U\\" shaped posts called goalposts. This helps their team score points. Now, the second longest field goal ever was made by a man named Matt Prater. Matt made this amazing kick in a game in 2013. His team, the Denver Broncos, was playing against the Tennessee Titans. So, how many yards was it? Well, Matt kicked the ball through the goalposts from an incredible 64 yards away! That's like kicking the ball from one end of a very long swimming pool to the other! This amazing kick helped his team win, and everyone was really excited about it. To put it in perspective, imagine if you placed 64 one-yard-long toy cars one behind the other. That's how far Matt had to kick the ball to score the field goal! Wow! In case you're curious, the longest field goal ever was a tiny bit longer at 66 yards. It was made by a player named Justin Tucker in 2021. But, Matt Prater's field goal of 64 yards will always be remembered as an awesome accomplishment.  I hope you enjoyed learning about the second longest field goal in American football history.

Context: In 1931, RCA Victor introduced their vinyl-based Victrolac compound as a material for some unusual-format and special-purpose records. By the end of the 1930s vinyl's advantages of light weight, relative unbreakability and low surface noise had made it the material of choice for prerecorded radio programming and other critical applications. When it came to ordinary 78 rpm records, however, the much higher cost of the raw material, as well as its vulnerability to the heavy pickups and crudely mass-produced steel needles still commonly used in home record players, made its general substitution for shellac impractical at that time. During the Second World War, the United States Armed Forces produced thousands of 12-inch vinyl 78 rpm V-Discs for use by the troops overseas. After the war, the wider use of vinyl became more practical as new record players with relatively lightweight crystal pickups and precision-ground styli made of sapphire or an exotic osmium alloy proliferated. In late 1945, RCA Victor began offering special transparent red vinyl De Luxe pressings of some classical 78s, at a de luxe price. Later, Decca Records introduced vinyl Deccalite 78s, while other record companies came up with vinyl concoctions such as Metrolite, Merco Plastic and Sav-o-flex, but these were mainly used to produce \\"unbreakable\\" children's records and special thin vinyl DJ pressings for shipment to radio stations.

Write a title for this article: The New Orleans Saints and the Detroit Lions, it should be noted, did play defense against each other. It just never seemed that way during the Saints’ 45-28 victory. Instead, watching this game was like watching tennis, head moving right, then left, back and forth, but slower, as both offenses took turns marching down the field. Despite a pair of fumbles, the Saints moved the ball at will, with the kind of panache and precision that reverberates across the league. Afterward, some Saints even suggested what once seemed improbable: that this offense is better than the one that carried New Orleans to a Super Bowl championship two years ago. When receiver Robert Meachem hauled in a 56-yard game-sealing score late in the fourth quarter, fittingly there was no defender within 20 yards of him. In the Saints’ triumph, in which they set an N.F.L. playoff record with 626 yards and both teams combined for an N.F.L. postseason-best 839 net passing yards, even the defenses were offensive. At the lectern afterward, Coach Sean Payton did not so much as crack a smile. He cut off an inevitable question about breaking another offensive record, his voice rushed. “We’re just focused on winning,” he said. “We’re not focused on yards or records.” New Orleans will play next week at San Francisco, a team that reinvented the passing offense in the 1980s but is known for its defense now. The Saints’ offense, which also gained 617 yards in its regular-season finale, is likely to be tested, outdoors and on the road and in the wind. Even if the events on Saturday did not provide that sort of implication. This game featured two teams that fancy passing. In the modern N.F.L., in which top-seeded New England and Green Bay boast the two most prolific offenses, Detroit and New Orleans have also bolstered the trend toward explosive offense, one completion at a time. Saints quarterback Drew Brees set league records for passing yards (5,476) and completion percentage (71.6) this season. Detroit quarterback Matthew Stafford joined him in the 5,000-yard-plus club with 5,038. The teams’ meeting Saturday marked the first time two such club members met in the playoffs. This, too, caught the attention of the oddsmakers, who set the over-under at 59, the highest ever for the postseason in which the maxim “defense wins championships” never changes. The Saints, 13-3 yet seeded third, without a bye, entered the contest as a trendy pick to win the Super Bowl. They won their final eight games before the playoffs, went undefeated at home and topped the Lions, 31-17, about a month ago. So it figured the teams would combine for a million points and an infinite amount of yards — which is pretty much what happened, give or take a yard or two. The deluge of offense started early, as expected. Detroit needed only four minutes to score. Stafford passed for 70 yards on the drive, finding tight end Will Heller for a 10-yard touchdown that briefly silenced the sold-out crowd, which had roared so loudly that the Superdome shook. This marked the Lions’ first lead in a playoff game since 1994, an even longer drought than the one to their last postseason foray in 1999. The Saints moved the ball with similar ease, until receiver Marques Colston fumbled and linebacker Justin Durant recovered for Detroit. New Orleans resumed its season-long scoring spree on its next possession, though, covering 89 yards with the speed of an express train. When running back Darren Sproles shifted left, away from a wall of Lions defenders and into the end zone for a 2-yard score, he tied the game at 7-7. The game continued in this fashion, more proof, perhaps, of the shifting landscape in the N.F.L. This was not old-school football, not 3 yards and a cloud of dust. This was flag football played in shoulder pads, or video-game football brought to life. One interruption to the narrative — offense, offense, offense — came from the Saints, who fumbled twice in the first half, as Detroit took a 14-7 lead on a back shoulder Calvin Johnson (12 catches, 211 yards) touchdown catch. The halftime score — 14-10 after the Saints kicked a field goal — was misleading, if only because it was so low. By then, the teams had accumulated 353 passing yards and 466 yards over all. Collectively, Brees and Stafford amassed 31 completions. The Saints even gained 83 yards on the ground. Early into the third quarter, the Saints’ halftime adjustment seemed obvious: throw deep. On a pair of touchdown drives, Brees connected on two passes longer than 40 yards and had another throw of similar length dropped. The first went to Devery Henderson for a 41-yard gain that ended in the end zone. The second, a 40-yard strike to Colston, set up a touchdown toss to Jimmy Graham that extended the Saints’ lead to 24-14. That lasted for all of a few minutes. Stafford, feeling left out in the deep-ball department, lobbed a 42-yard pass into Johnson’s waiting hands. Stafford punctuated the drive with a scramble to the right front corner of the end zone, extending toward the pylon for a score officials upheld upon review. It was the Saints, though, who scored 35 points after halftime, who played offense the way the Beatles played music, masterfully. In case that point had not been driven home, Brees and Meachem connected on another late long ball, which gave Brees 466 passing yards. This helped to erase the memory that lingered from last season, when New Orleans traveled to Seattle and fell to the first team to make the playoffs with a losing record. On Saturday morning, cornerback Jabari Greer saw Matt Hasselbeck, last year a Seahawks cornerback, on television. The memories, which Greer helped erase with two interceptions, came flooding back. Soon enough, they were replaced with a flood of offense. The Saints never even punted.

The answer to the question: What is the first name of the person Lennon was drinking with when he tried to strangle Pang? is inside the article: ABKCO Industries was formed in 1968 by Allen Klein as an umbrella company to ABKCO Records. Klein hired May Pang as a receptionist in 1969. Through involvement in a project with ABKCO, Lennon and Ono met her the following year. She became their personal assistant. In 1973, after she had been working with the couple for three years, Ono confided that she and Lennon were becoming estranged. She went on to suggest that Pang should begin a physical relationship with Lennon, telling her, \\"He likes you a lot.\\" Astounded by Ono's proposition, Pang nevertheless agreed to become Lennon's companion. The pair soon left for Los Angeles, beginning an 18-month period he later called his \\"lost weekend\\". In Los Angeles, Pang encouraged Lennon to develop regular contact with Julian, whom he had not seen for two years. He also rekindled friendships with Starr, McCartney, Beatles roadie Mal Evans, and Harry Nilsson. While Lennon was drinking with Nilsson, he misunderstood something that Pang had said and attempted to strangle her. Lennon relented only after he was physically restrained by Nilsson.In June, Lennon and Pang returned to Manhattan in their newly rented penthouse apartment where they prepared a spare room for Julian when he visited them.  Lennon, who had been inhibited by Ono in this regard, began to reestablish contact with other relatives and friends.  By December, he and Pang were considering a house purchase, and he refused to accept Ono's telephone calls. In January 1975, he agreed to meet Ono, who claimed to have found a cure for smoking. After the meeting, he failed to return home or call Pang. When Pang telephoned the next day, Ono told her that Lennon was unavailable because he was exhausted after a hypnotherapy session. Two days later, Lennon reappeared at a joint dental appointment; he was stupefied and confused to such an extent that Pang believed he had been brainwashed. Lennon told Pang that his separation from Ono was now over, although Ono would allow him to continue seeing her as his mistress., can you guess it ?

The Bears opened the season hosting rival Green Bay Packers, the 191st meeting in the two teams' history and the third season opener in which both teams played each other in Chicago; the Bears held a 93-91-6 all-time lead, and also led the series in season opener record with 17-12-2. However, the Packers had won nine of the last ten games between the two, including the last game, a 55-14 victory at Lambeau Field. WBBM-TV analyst Jeff Joniak believed the Bears would have to run to gain an advantage against the Packers; when Chicago played Green Bay in week four last season, the latter had the 30th-ranked run defense, and allowed 235 rushing yards in that game. Additionally, the offense had to avoid drives that required long yardage, as the Bears had scored 74 points outside of the red zone (the 29th-best in the league), while also protecting  quarterback Jay Cutler from linebackers Julius Peppers and Clay Matthews III. On defense, the new 3-4 defense faced a fast-paced Green Bay offense featuring quarterback Aaron Rodgers and tailback Eddie Lacy. The Rodgers-led Packers, who led the NFC North in touchdowns with 58, along with having the highest average yards per play (6.17) in the NFL in 2014, also provided a challenge for the Bears defensive backs; blitzing Rodgers was also a liability, as he had a league-best 130.4 rating with 15 touchdowns and one interception against the blitz. However, the Packers did not have receiver Jordy Nelson, who had caught 13 touchdowns in 2014, as he had suffered an ACL tear during the preseason.  quarteback David Fales, cornerback Tracy Porter, runningback Ka'Deem Carey, linebacker Jon Bostic, center Hroniss Grasu, tackle Tayo Fabuluje and receiver Cameron Meredith were inactive for the game. The Packers won the coin toss, and elected to defer, meaning the Bears started the game with the ball. On the first possession of the game, the Bears offense reached as far as the Packers' eight-yard line, but ended with Robbie Gould kicking a 28-yard field goal. After the Packers punted, the Bears came close to allowing a turnover when Cutler was sacked by Peppers and fumbled, though the call was reversed. The next four drives of the game ended in scores for both teams: the Packers scored with Rodgers' 13-yard touchdown pass to James Jones, followed by the Bears reclaiming the lead in the second quarter with Matt Forte's one-yard touchdown run; the next two possessions concluded with field goals: Mason Crosby tied the game with a 37-yarder, though the Bears ended the first half with the 13-10 lead with Gould's 50-yarder. Prior to Forte's touchdown run, Gould had kicked a 27-yard field goal, but Sam Shields was offsides on the play, giving the Bears a 4th and 1, which the Bears capitalized with via Forte's one-yard run. The Bears then had two potential touchdowns nullified by Forte dropping a pass, and receiver Alshon Jeffery's touchdown was canceled by tackle Jermon Bushrod's holding penalty. The Packers also had a potential touchdown hurt by a penalty, as Rodgers had an eight-yard touchdown pass to Jones voided by holding penalties. In the second half, the Packers scored quickly with Jones' one-yard touchdown catch. The Bears responded with Gould's 44-yard field goal, but the Packers eventually scored again via Randall Cobb's five-yard touchdown catch. On Chicago's following drive, the offense drove to Green Bay's six-yard line to set up a first and goal situation. While Forte's four-yard run brought the Bears to the two, Cutler's passes to Eddie Royal, Jeffery and Royal again fell incomplete, leading to the Bears turning the ball over on downs. The Packers punted again, but the Bears failed to score when Cutler was intercepted by Matthews; the turnover set up Lacy's two-yard touchdown run to increase the score to 31-16 with 1:55 left in the game. With 34 seconds left, the Bears scored with Cutler's 24-yard touchdown pass to tight end Martellus Bennett, narrowing the margin to eight points. However, Green Bay's Davante Adams recovered the onside kick, and the Packers ran out the clock to end the game. Gould's first field goal of the game allowed him to set the franchise record for the most field goals with 244, breaking a tie with Kevin Butler. Forte recorded 184 rushing yards in the game, the most by a Bears running back in a loss since Walter Payton's 175 yards in a 1984 loss to the Packers. Ask a question about this article.","output":"What led to the Packers' victory in this game against the Chicago Bears? In the 191st meeting between the rival Green Bay Packers and Chicago Bears, the Packers emerged victorious due to consistent scoring, efficient offensive plays, and opportunistic defense. The Packers scored touchdowns with Rodgers' passes to James Jones and Randall Cobb and Eddie Lacy's two-yard touchdown run in the second half. Additionally, the Bears' potential touchdowns were often nullified by dropped passes and penalties. The Packers defense played a crucial role, with Julius Peppers and Clay Matthews III putting pressure on Bears quarterback Jay Cutler, which eventually resulted in an interception by Matthews."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write an article using the following points: Hong Kong's natural background radiation comes from local granite. Rock aggregate used in cement for local buildings. Radiation was monitored by Tokyo-based citizen action group. Levels of radiation in city are not harmful.","output":"Title: Hong Kong's Natural Background Radiation: A Comprehensive Overview Introduction Hong Kong, a bustling metropolis on the southeastern coast of China, is well-known for its breathtaking skyline and vibrant city life. However, not many are aware of the natural background radiation that exists throughout the city, originating from the local granite formations found in Hong Kong. This article aims to discuss the natural radioactive background of Hong Kong, the use of granite aggregates in local building materials, the Tokyo-based citizen action group's role in monitoring this radiation, and why the radiation levels in Hong Kong are considered safe. Hong Kong's Natural Background Radiation The natural background radiation of Hong Kong primarily emanates from the local granite, which covers about 85% of the city's total land area. Granite is an igneous rock, composed of minerals like quartz, feldspar, and mica, and contains small amounts of naturally occurring radioactive materials such as uranium, thorium, and potassium-40. These elements emit gamma radiation, which contributes to the overall background radiation levels. Radiation in Building Materials In Hong Kong, the rock aggregate used for constructing buildings is sourced from local granite deposits. This means that the cement used in local buildings and infrastructure contains trace amounts of natural radioactive elements, contributing to the background radiation in the vicinity. However, it is essential to note that the radiation level in building materials is not high enough to pose any significant health risks. Monitoring Radiation Levels by Tokyo-based Citizen Action Group To ensure transparency and safety, a Tokyo-based citizen action group has been conducting regular radiation level tests and monitoring the situation in Hong Kong. This group, composed of experienced volunteers, works in collaboration with Hong Kong authorities to provide accurate and real-time data regarding radiation exposure in the city. By doing so, they aim to alleviate any undue concern while also promoting greater understanding about natural background radiation among the general public. Levels of Radiation in Hong Kong: Not Harmful According to the Hong Kong Observatory, the average dose of natural background radiation received by a resident in the city is approximately 2 millisieverts (mSv) per year. This value is considered to be relatively low when compared globally, with the worldwide average exposure to natural radiation being 2.4 mSv. Moreover, this value lies well below the internationally recommended exposure limit of 20 mSv, as set by the International Commission on Radiological Protection. It is also important to emphasize that natural background radiation is present everywhere in our environment, and the controlled utilization of granite in building materials does not create any additional health risks. For comparison, cosmic radiation contributes around 0.4 mSv annually, while medical procedures such as X-rays add about 0.6 mSv annually to an individual's dose. Conclusion Hong Kong's natural background radiation, primarily emanating from local granite formations, plays a role in the overall radiation levels observed in the city. The use of granite aggregate in construction materials does contribute to background radiation, but the levels remain well within the safe limits established by international guidelines. Thanks to monitoring by the Tokyo-based citizen action group, residents can have confidence in the safety and transparency of radiation level measurements in Hong Kong. By understanding the nature of the city's background radiation, citizens can appreciate the inherently low risk that it poses, while continuing to enjoy the dynamic and vibrant atmosphere Hong Kong has to offer."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Also widely called dorado and dolphin, it is one of two members of the Coryphaenidae family, the other being the pompano dolphinfish. Question: is mahi-mahi a type of dolphin?","output":"No, the mahi-mahi is not a type of dolphin. Although the name \\"common dolphinfish\\" may sound misleading, the mahi-mahi (Coryphaena hippurus) is a species of fish and is not related to dolphins, which are marine mammals. The mahi-mahi is a surface-dwelling ray-finned fish found in off-shore temperate, tropical, and subtropical waters worldwide. The name \\"dolphinfish\\" is due to its physical appearance, which is marked by a blunt head, striking colors, and a somewhat streamlined body, resembling some characteristics of a dolphin. However, scientifically and biologically, the mahi-mahi and dolphins belong to completely different groups and share no close evolutionary relation. The mahi-mahi belongs to the family Coryphaenidae, with another member being the pompano dolphinfish. These fish are also commonly known as dorado. They are characterized by their unique shape, vibrant coloration, and swift swimming capabilities. Mahi-mahi are primarily known for their brilliant colors, which include golden, green, and blue hues, giving them a distinctive appearance. The fish can undergo swift color changes when under stress or pursuing prey, displaying a wide range of color variations. On the other hand, dolphins are marine mammals that belong to the family Delphinidae, within the infraorder Cetacea. Dolphins are highly intelligent creatures, known for their playful behavior, advanced communication skills, and echolocation capabilities. They have distinct features such as a streamlined body, a dorsal fin, and a pointed snout filled with sharp teeth. Dolphins are also air-breathing mammals, unlike the mahi-mahi, which extract oxygen through gills, like other fish. The confusion between the terms \\"dolphin\\" and \\"dolphinfish\\" can lead someone to assume that the mahi-mahi is a type of dolphin, but they are not related in any way other than their somewhat similar appearance. In fact, the mahi-mahi and the actual dolphin are part of two completely separate and distinct groups in the animal kingdom, with the former being a fish and the latter being a marine mammal. In order to differentiate between the two, the term \\"mahi-mahi\\" is typically used to refer specifically to the fish species Coryphaena hippurus, and to avoid confusion with the marine mammals known as dolphins."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

If you are especially lucky, you might even glimpse a grey wolf, nearly dying out from hunting on the mainland. Plenty of hiking paths open the area to exploration. The 4-mile Stroll Path winds through various trees and offers a tour of the island's history, including prehistoric Indian mines. The Jungle Path leads to Scoville Point----a perfect picnic spot surrounded on three sides by the shining waters of Lake Superior. You can also rent a boat at the park's service center and row down the shore to the Rock Harbor Lighthouse. Here park's service employees use nets to show how lake fishes used to be caught by the original local people. Their catch ends up on the dinner menu at the Rock Harbor Lodge. The park is open from mid-April through October; Rock Harbor Lodge is open from Memorial Day weekend until just after Labor Day.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Information:  - Christianity is a monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ, who serves as the focal point for the religion. It is the world's largest religion, with over 2.4 billion followers, or 33% of the global population, known as Christians. Christians believe that Jesus is the Son of God and the savior of humanity whose coming as the Messiah (the Christ) was prophesied in the Old Testament.  - John Wesley (or ; 2 March 1791) was an Anglican cleric and theologian who, with his brother Charles and fellow cleric George Whitefield, founded Methodism.  - The Catholic Church, also known as the Roman Catholic Church, is the largest Christian church, with more than 1.27 billion members worldwide. As one of the oldest religious institutions in the world, it has played a prominent role in the history of Western civilisation. Headed by the Bishop of Rome, known as the pope, its doctrines are summarised in the Nicene Creed. The Catholic Church is notable within Western Christianity for its sacred tradition and seven sacraments.  - Martin Luther (10 November 1483  18 February 1546), O.S.A., was a German professor of theology, composer, priest, monk and a seminal figure in the Protestant Reformation. Luther came to reject several teachings and practices of the Roman Catholic Church. He strongly disputed the claim that freedom from God's punishment for sin could be purchased with money, proposing an academic discussion of the practice and efficacy of indulgences in his \\"Ninety-five Theses\\" of 1517. His refusal to renounce all of his writings at the demand of Pope Leo X in 1520 and the Holy Roman Emperor Charles V at the Diet of Worms in 1521 resulted in his excommunication by the Pope and condemnation as an outlaw by the Emperor.  - A Christian (or ) is a person who follows or adheres to Christianity, an Abrahamic, monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus Christ. \\"Christian\\" derives from the Koine Greek word \\"Christós\\" (), a translation of the Biblical Hebrew term \\"mashiach\\".  - The pope (from \\"pappas\\", a child's word for \\"father\\") is the Bishop of Rome and, therefore, the leader of the worldwide Catholic Church. The primacy of the Roman bishop is largely derived from his role as the traditional successor to Saint Peter, to whom Jesus is supposed to have given the keys of Heaven and the powers of \\"binding and loosing\\", naming him as the \\"rock\\" upon which the church would be built. The current pope is Francis, who was elected on 13 March 2013, succeeding Benedict XVI.  - Pontius Pilate (or ; Latin: \\"Pontius Pltus\\", , \\"Pontios Pltos\\") was the fifth prefect of the Roman province of Judaea from AD 2636. He served under Emperor Tiberius, and is best known today for the trial and crucifixion of Jesus.  - Charles Wesley (or ; 18 December 1707  29 March 1788) was an English leader of the Methodist movement, most widely known for writing more than 6,000 hymns.  - Lutheranism is a major branch of Protestant Christianity which identifies with the theology of Martin Luther (1483-1546), a German friar, ecclesiastical reformer and theologian.  - George Whitefield (30 September 1770), also spelled George Whitfield, was an English Anglican cleric who was one of the founders of Methodism and the evangelical movement.  - Methodism, or the Methodist movement, is a group of historically related denominations of Protestant Christianity which derive their inspiration from the life and teachings of John Wesley. George Whitefield and John's brother Charles Wesley were also significant leaders in the movement. It originated as a revival within the 18th century Church of England and became a separate Church after Wesley's death. Because of vigorous missionary work, the movement spread throughout the British Empire, the United States and beyond, today claiming approximately 80 million adherents worldwide.  - Jesus (; c. 4 BC  c. AD 30/33), also referred to as Jesus of Nazareth or Jesus Christ, was a Jewish preacher and religious leader who became the central figure of Christianity. Christians believe him to be the Son of God and the awaited Messiah (Christ) prophesied in the Old Testament. Virtually all modern scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed historically, although the quest for the historical Jesus has produced little agreement on the historical reliability of the Gospels and on how closely the biblical Jesus reflects the historical Jesus. Jesus was a Galilean Jew who was baptized by John the Baptist and subsequently began his own ministry, preaching his message orally and often being referred to as \\"rabbi\\". He was arrested and tried by the Jewish authorities, and was crucified by the order of Pontius Pilate, the Roman prefect. Jesus debated fellow Jews on how to best follow God, performed healings, taught in parables and gathered followers. After his death, his followers believed he rose from the dead, and the community they formed eventually became the Christian Church.  - Generically, a Galilean is an inhabitant of Galilee. Historically, a Galilean dialect of Jewish Palestinian Aramaic was spoken there. Later, the term was used to refer to the early Christians, among others by the Roman emperors Julian and Marcus Aurelius.  - John the Baptist (\\"Ioánnes (h)o baptistés\\" or   , \\"Ioánnes (h)o baptízon\\", known as the prophet \\"Yahya\\" in the Quran), also known as John the Baptizer, was a Jewish itinerant preacher in the early first century AD. John is revered as a major religious figure in Christianity, Islam, the Bahá'í Faith, and Mandaeism. He is called a prophet by all of these traditions, and is honoured as a saint in many Christian traditions.  - Joseph ( Hebrew  , Yosef ; Greek :  , Ioseph ) is a figure in the Gospels , the husband of the Blessed Virgin Mary , the mother of Jesus , and is venerated as Saint Joseph in the Catholic Church , Eastern Orthodox Church , Oriental Orthodox Church , Anglican Communion , Lutheranism and Methodism . Christian tradition places Joseph as Jesus ' foster father . Some historians state that Joseph was Jesus 's father . Some differing views are due to theological interpretations versus historical views . The Pauline epistles make no reference to Jesus 's father ; nor does the Gospel of Mark . The first appearance of Joseph is in the gospels of Matthew and Luke . Each contains a genealogy of Jesus showing ancestry from king David , but through different sons ; Matthew follows the major royal line from Solomon , while Luke traces another line back to Nathan , another son of David and Bathsheba . Consequently , all the names between David and Joseph are different . According to Matthew 1:16 \`\` Jacob begat Joseph the husband of Mary '' , while according to Luke 3:23 , Joseph is said to be \`\` ( the son ) of Heli '' . Some scholars reconcile the genealogies by viewing the Solomonic lineage in Matthew as Joseph 's major royal line , and the Nathanic lineage in Luke to be Mary 's minor line . In Catholic and other traditions , Joseph is the patron saint of workers and has several feast days . He was also declared to be the patron saint and protector of the Catholic Church by Pope Pius IX in 1870 , and is the patron of several countries and regions . With the growth of Mariology , the theological field of Josephology has also grown and since the 1950s centers for studying it have been formed .  - The historical reliability of the Gospels refers to the reliability and historic character of the four New Testament gospels as historical documents. Some believe that all four canonical gospels meet the five criteria for historical reliability; some say that little in the gospels is considered to be historically reliable. Almost all scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed, but scholars differ on the historicity of specific episodes described in the Biblical accounts of Jesus, and the only two events subject to \\"almost universal assent\\" are that Jesus was baptized by John the Baptist and was crucified by the order of the Roman Prefect Pontius Pilate. Elements whose historical authenticity is disputed include the two accounts of the Nativity of Jesus, the miraculous events including the resurrection, and certain details about the crucifixion.    What is the relationship between 'saint joseph' and 'jesus christ'? A:","output":"Saint Joseph is considered the foster father or legal guardian of Jesus Christ in Christianity. He was married to the Blessed Virgin Mary, who is the mother of Jesus. According to the Gospels of Matthew and Luke, Joseph was a righteous man who raised Jesus and provided for his family. Although not much is written about Joseph's direct interactions with Jesus, it is believed that he played an important role in the upbringing of Jesus in adherence to Jewish customs and traditions. Although there are different genealogies provided in the Gospels of Matthew and Luke, tracing Jesus' lineage back to King David through Joseph's family line, it is important to note that Christians believe in the Virgin birth of Jesus. This means that Joseph is not considered the biological father of Jesus; rather, he holds a significant place as the earthly guardian and caretaker of Jesus. In addition to being regarded as a saint in various Christian denominations, Saint Joseph is also the patron saint of workers, families, and the Universal Church. Overall, Saint Joseph's relationship with Jesus Christ is that of a foster father or legal guardian who raised Jesus and taught him the ways of a faithful Jewish life."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You are expected to classify the comment into two classes: sexual-explicit and non-sexual-explicit. A comment is considered sexual-explicit if it explicitly portrays sexual matters. Comment: “Most high school kids across America today couldn’t identify a clitoris.” That's the prime reason Google was invented.","output":"To categorize the comment, we need to look at its content and analyze it in the context of the provided classes, which are sexual-explicit and non-sexual-explicit.  1. First, we break down the comment: \\"Most high school kids across America today couldn’t identify a clitoris. That's the prime reason Google was invented.\\" This comment mentions a sexual body part (clitoris), but it's in the context of anatomical knowledge and education. It is not explicitly sexual or describing a sexual act, but instead addresses the lack of sex education in schools and the existing gap in knowledge. 2. Secondly, the comment seems to subtly mock or criticize the situation that people rely on online platforms like Google to seek basic knowledge. It does not include any explicit sexual content or describe any sexual activity. Therefore, based on the analysis above, I would categorize this comment as non-sexual-explicit. While it does mention a sex-related term in a scientific or educational context, it does not openly portray sexual actions or present any sexually explicit material or intention. The purpose of the comment seems less about sexual content and more about a statement on education and the use of the internet for information."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Make sure that your essay has an introduction, body, and conclusion. While you are writing practice essays, get in the habit of structuring your essays in that way. Each body paragraph should focus on 1 subject. Don’t forget to include a strong thesis statement!   Use keywords and phrases to mark your place in the essay. For example, if you’re comparing to points, say, “In contrast to…” When you come to your last paragraph, you can say something like, “To conclude…” When you’re studying, stick to a plan for writing your essays. You should get used to spending 4-5 minutes planning and organizing your writing. Save another 5 minutes at the end to edit your work. The rest of the time should be devoted to writing the essay. You should use clear, brief sentences for the writing portion. Make sure to stay on topic and only write about the main points of your outline.  For example, if you're writing about an essay on taking care of your dog, you might write, \\"The most important thing is to give your dog lots of attention. Play with it, take it outside, and talk to it every day. You also need to focus on giving it nutritious food.\\" Write in the active voice to make your points really clear.

The Agencies Confer When they learned a second plane had struck the World Trade Center, nearly everyone in the White House told us, they immediately knew it was not an accident. The Secret Service initiated a number of security enhancements around the White House complex. The officials who issued these orders did not know that there were additional hijacked aircraft, or that one such aircraft was en route to Washington. These measures were precautionary steps taken because of the strikes in New York. The FAA and White House Teleconferences. The FAA, the White House, and the Defense Department each initiated a multiagency teleconference before 9:30. Because none of these teleconferences-at least before 10:00- included the right officials from both the FAA and Defense Department, none succeeded in meaningfully coordinating the military and FAA response to the hijackings. At about 9:20, security personnel at FAA headquarters set up a hijacking teleconference with several agencies, including the Defense Department. The NMCC officer who participated told us that the call was monitored only periodically because the information was sporadic, it was of little value, and there were other important tasks. The FAA manager of the teleconference also remembered that the military participated only briefly before the Pentagon was hit. Both individuals agreed that the teleconference played no role in coordinating a response to the attacks of 9/11. Acting Deputy Administrator Belger was frustrated to learn later in the morning that the military had not been on the call. At the White House, the video teleconference was conducted from the Situation Room by Richard Clarke, a special assistant to the president long involved in counterterrorism. Logs indicate that it began at 9:25 and included the CIA; the FBI; the departments of State, Justice, and Defense; the FAA; and the White House shelter. The FAA and CIA joined at 9:40. The first topic addressed in the White House video teleconference-at about 9:40-was the physical security of the President, the White House, and federal agencies. Immediately thereafter it was reported that a plane had hit the Pentagon. We found no evidence that video teleconference participants had any prior information that American 77 had been hijacked and was heading directly toward Washington.  Question: \\"Why couldn't the FAA and the Defense Department officials coordinate a military response during the conference call set up at FAA headquarters at 9:20?\\" Response: \\"No one had the right officials on the calls before 10am\\" Available choices: [-] no [-] yes Does the response correctly answer the question?","output":"yes The response correctly answers the question because it states that none of the teleconferences before 10:00 included the right officials from both the FAA and Defense Department. This lack of proper representation from both organizations hindered their ability to meaningfully coordinate the military and FAA response to the hijackings."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Depressed teen Ashton Sachs guns down both his parents then gives moving eulogy at their funeral A DEPRESSED teen shot his parents as they slept at their £2m mansion – then told mourners they would continue to ‘guide him’ through life. Ashton Sachs, 19, fought back tears as he spoke at his parents’ funeral describing them as the perfect mum and dad. “I really do believe that they will continue to guide me throughout life,” Ashton said to the devastated congregation. But what everybody else didn’t know was that the teen was responsible for a horror crime which left cops baffled. Weeks earlier, ‘an intruder’ had entered the family mansion and gunned down Brad and Andra Sachs with an automatic rifle. Their youngest son was left paralysed and their two daughters, who escaped unharmed, were deeply traumatised. Ashton’s touching funeral words had moved a community so when later police named him as the killer locals were stunned. Andra, 54, and Brad, 57, lived in the affluent community of San Juan Capistrano, California. Back in 1999, the couple had been through a bitter divorce after their 16-month-old daughter Sabrina accidentally drowned in the family pool. But the couple reunite and the family were said to be happier than ever. They had two daughters, Lana, 15, and Alexis, 17, and three boys, Landon, eight, Ashton, 19, and Myles, 21. Lana and Landon had been adopted from Russia. Ashton and Myles had left home for college and lived 1,200 miles away in Washington. On the night of the killing, Ashton entered the Sachs’ family house through an unlocked door and went up to his parent’s bedroom. He opened fire with a semi-automatic rifle and shot them multiple times at close range. Andra took 10 bullets. Brad, a dozen. He then went into Landon’s room and fired at the bed. Landon was left bleeding and crying hysterically that he couldn’t feel his legs. The intruder then fired at Alexis, but as she hid under the covers, the bullet missed her. Her sister Lana wasn’t shot at. As part of his charade, Ashton kept a vigil by Landon’s bedside. A bullet had pierced his spinal cord and he was paralysed from the chest down. Ashton even helped compile a list of potential enemies. Then investigators discovered a car parked at premises owned by the Sachs family. In the boot was the rifle used in the shooting. The white car belonged to Ashton. Ashton was then arrested and charged with premeditated murder. When questioned, Ashton said his plan was to “shoot them and then kill myself”. “I was like, not myself… I was something twisted,” he said. Investigators discovered Ashton had bought the gun weeks before and he’d driven 18 hours non-stop to get to the family home, never wavering from his plan. He suggested he was angry with his parents because they didn’t trust him and he thought that he was their least favourite child. This year, Ashton made a shock guilty plea and was sentenced Ashton to four life sentences, plus another 100 years. Myles, 23, is now guardian to his orphaned siblings, including wheelchair-bound Landon, who is courageously adjusting to his life-changing injuries.

Astonishingly, after the murder, Ashton went on to give a moving eulogy at his parents' funeral which deeply touched the community.

She has been a favorite among the elderly residents due to her kind and caring nature. However, one day while on duty, she finds herself being held at gunpoint by a mysterious man named Royce. Act 1: Sheridan's parents, who were the founders of Prestigious Pines Senior Care Facility, passed away under mysterious circumstances. Sheridan is determined to uncover the truth behind her parent's death, despite the lack of cooperation from the local authorities.  Simultaneously, Royce's mother has recently been admitted to the senior care facility. Unbeknownst to Sheridan, Royce is a skilled private investigator who has been suspicious of the events surrounding Sheridan's parents' deaths. His primary motivation is to protect his mother from any potential harm. Act 2: As Sheridan and Royce become acquainted with each other, they begin to realize that they share the same concerns regarding the senior care facility and their suspicions grow stronger. Sheridan discovers that some of the staff members are using the facility as a front to launder money and deal in illegal activities. The facility's director, Mr. Decker, starts to notice Sheridan's persistence in investigating the facility and becomes worried that her discoveries will jeopardize his entire operation. He orders his accomplices to keep an eye on her and silence her if necessary. Act 3: While on a normal shift, Sheridan stumbles upon incriminating evidence, a folder containing records of illicit transactions, and underhanded dealings. Mr. Decker, sensing potential danger, decides to take drastic measures and orders a cover-up. This arouses Royce's suspicion, and he confronts Sheridan, demanding answers at gunpoint. However, before Royce can get the information he wants, Mr. Decker and his accomplices intervene, leading to a tense standoff. Using cunning and teamwork, Sheridan and Royce disarm their captors, and they work together to expose the director's criminal activities. Conclusion: As a result of their tumultuous journey, Sheridan and Royce manage to unmask the corrupt individuals who have been exploiting the Prestigious Pines Senior Care Facility. With the case finally closed, the two establish a newfound friendship, and the future of the facility is secure, ensuring that the residents receive the loving care they each deserve. As both the facility and its residents thrive, Royce decides to move forward with his career as a private investigator, while Sheridan, inspired by her journey, dedicates her life to ensuring the well-being and happiness of the elderly."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the southwest, and the Bay of Bengal on the southeast, it shares land borders with Pakistan to the west; China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the northeast; and Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives, while its Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia. The Indian subcontinent was home to the urban Indus Valley Civilisation of the 3rd millennium BCE. In the following millennium, the oldest scriptures associated with Hinduism began to be composed. Social stratification, based on caste, emerged in the first millennium BCE, and Buddhism and Jainism arose. Early political consolidations took place under the Maurya and Gupta empires; later peninsular Middle Kingdoms influenced cultures as far as Southeast Asia. In the medieval era, Judaism, Zoroastrianism, Christianity, and Islam arrived, and Sikhism emerged, all adding to the region's diverse culture. Much of the north fell to the Delhi Sultanate; the south was united under the Vijayanagara Empire. The economy expanded in the 17th century in the Mughal Empire. In the mid-18th century, the subcontinent came under British East India Company rule, and in the mid-19th under British Crown rule. A nationalist movement emerged in the late 19th century, which later, under Mahatma Gandhi, was noted for nonviolent resistance and led to India's independence in 1947.

With an estimated 2015 population of 8,550,405 distributed over a land area of just , New York City is also the most densely populated major city in the United States. Located at the southern tip of the state of New York, the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area, one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world. A global power city, New York City exerts a significant impact upon commerce, finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education, and entertainment, its fast pace defining the term \\"New York minute\\". Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an important center for international diplomacy and has been described as the cultural and financial capital of the world.  - Research comprises \\"creative work undertaken on a systematic basis in order to increase the stock of knowledge, including knowledge of humans, culture and society, and the use of this stock of knowledge to devise new applications.\\" It is used to establish or confirm facts, reaffirm the results of previous work, solve new or existing problems, support theorems, or develop new theories. A research project may also be an expansion on past work in the field. Research projects can be used to develop further knowledge on a topic, or in the example of a school research project, they can be used to further a student's research prowess to prepare them for future jobs or reports. To test the validity of instruments, procedures, or experiments, research may replicate elements of prior projects or the project as a whole. The primary purposes of basic research (as opposed to applied research) are documentation, discovery, interpretation, or the research and development (R&D) of methods and systems for the advancement of human knowledge. Approaches to research depend on epistemologies, which vary considerably both within and between humanities and sciences. There are several forms of research: scientific, humanities, artistic, economic, social, business, marketing, practitioner research, life, technological,etc.  - A port is a location on a coast or shore containing one or more harbors where ships can dock and transfer people or cargo to or from land. Port locations are selected to optimize access to land and navigable water, for commercial demand, and for shelter from wind and waves. Ports with deeper water are rarer, but can handle larger ships. Since ports throughout history handled every kind of traffic, support and storage facilities vary widely, may extend for miles, and dominate the local economy. Some ports have an important military role.  - Elizabeth Cochran Seaman (May 5, 1864  January 27, 1922), known by her pen name Nellie Bly, was an American journalist. She was also a writer, industrialist, inventor, and a charity worker who was widely known for her record-breaking trip around the world in 72 days, in emulation of Jules Verne's fictional character Phileas Fogg, and an exposé in which she faked insanity to study a mental institution from within. She was a pioneer in her field, and launched a new kind of investigative journalism.  - The New York World was a newspaper published in New York City from 1860 until 1931. The paper played a major role in the history of American newspapers. It was a leading national voice of the Democratic Party. From 1883 to 1911 under publisher Joseph Pulitzer, it became a pioneer in yellow journalism, capturing readers' attention and pushing its daily circulation to the one-million mark.  - Yellow journalism, or the yellow press, is a type of journalism that presents little or no legitimate well-researched news and instead uses eye-catching headlines to sell more newspapers. Techniques may include exaggerations of news events, scandal-mongering or sensationalism. By extension, the term \\"yellow journalism\\" is used today as a pejorative to decry any journalism that treats news in an unprofessional or unethical fashion.  - Jules Gabriel Verne ( 8 February 1828  24 March 1905) was a French novelist, poet, and playwright best known for his adventure novels and his profound influence on the literary genre of science fiction.  - Headquarters (HQ) denotes the location where most, if not all, of the important functions of an organization are coordinated. In the United States, the corporate headquarters represents the entity at the center or the top of a corporation taking full responsibility for managing all business activities. In the UK, the term head office is most commonly used for the HQs of large corporations. The term is also used regarding military organizations.  - Phileas Fogg is the protagonist in the 1873 Jules Verne novel \\"Around the World in Eighty Days\\".  - The history of American newspapers begins in the early 18th century with the publication of the first colonial newspapers. American newspapers began as modest affairsa sideline for printers. They became a political force in the campaign for American independence. Following independence the first article of U.S. Constitution guaranteed freedom of the press and the American press grew rapidly during the First Party System (1790s-1810s) when both parties sponsored papers to reach their loyal partisans. From the 1830s onward the Penny press began to play a major role in American journalism and technological advancements such as the telegraph and faster printing presses in the 1840s helped expand the press of the nation as it experienced rapid economic and demographic growth. Editors typically became the local party spokesman, and hard-hitting editorials were widely reprinted.  By 1900 major newspapers had become profitable powerhouses of advocacy, muckraking and sensationalism, along with serious, and objective news-gathering. During the early 20th Century, prior to rise of television, the average American read several newspapers per-day. Starting in the 1920s changes in technology again morphed the nature of American journalism as radio and later, television, began to play increasingly important competitive roles.  - Joseph Pulitzer (born József Pulitzer; April 10, 1847  October 29, 1911) was a Hungarian-American newspaper publisher of the \\"St. Louis Post Dispatch\\" and the \\"New York World\\". Pulitzer introduced the techniques of yellow journalism to the newspapers he acquired in the 1880s. He became a leading national figure in the Democratic Party and was elected congressman from New York. He crusaded against big business and corruption, and helped keep the Statue of Liberty in New York.  - In the study of human settlements, an urban agglomeration is an extended city or town area comprising the built-up area of a central place (\\"usually a municipality\\") and any suburbs linked by continuous urban area. INSEE, the French Statistical Institute, uses the term \\"unité urbaine\\", which means continuous urbanized area. However, because of differences in definitions of what does and does not constitute an \\"agglomeration\\", as well as variations and limitations in statistical or geographical methodology, it can be problematic to compare different agglomerations around the world. It may not be clear, for instance, whether an area should be considered to be a satellite and part of an agglomeration, or a distinct entity in itself.  - A newspaper is a serial publication containing news about current events, other informative articles (listed below) about politics, sports, arts, and so on, and advertising. A newspaper is usually, but not exclusively, printed on relatively inexpensive, low-grade paper such as newsprint. The journalism organizations that publish newspapers are themselves often metonymically called newspapers. As of 2017, most newspapers are now published online as well as in print. The online versions are called online newspapers or news websites. Newspapers are typically published daily or weekly. News magazines are also weekly, but they have a magazine format. General-interest newspapers typically publish news articles and feature articles on national and international news as well as local news. The news includes political events and personalities, business and finance, crime, weather, and natural disasters; health and medicine, science, and computers and technology; sports; and entertainment, society, food and cooking, clothing and home fashion, and the arts.   - Ten Days in a Mad - House is a book by newspaper reporter Nellie Bly .

Certain areas, such as California and Japan, are more _ earthquakes than others. Although the chance of being caught in \\"The Big one\\" is remote, it's wise to be prepared if you live in a region where earthquakes are common. Educate your family about earthquakes before a big one strikes. For example, they need to know to take shelter in a doorway or under a strong object if indoors, and never to run outdoors if they are inside. If outside, they need to know to stay away from power lines and buildings where objects could fall. Teach family members how to turn off gas or water lines or electrical power that may need to be shut off after a quake if severe damage occurs. Develop a plan. Where will your family meet in the event of a disaster? What if some people are at work or school? How will you know if they are safe? Where will you all meet up? Pack a preparedness kit  and keep it in a safe location. In a major earthquake, it's possible that you won't be able to get into your house. Keep supplies in your car trunk or an outside storage shed if possible. Pack whatever your family is likely to need, enough for three days to a week, including food, water, medication, first aid and personal hygiene supplies, flashlights, a portable radio, blankets, clothes and shoes, cash, or camp stove, candles, matches or lighters, and a whistle.

Q:What is the answer for the question: What is the full name of the man who's participation was believed to be confirmed by Gonzaga princes in the opera that omits La messaggera in the 1609 score? from the following article ?  In his personaggi listed in the 1609 score, Monteverdi unaccountably omits La messaggera (the Messenger), and indicates that the final chorus of shepherds who perform the moresca (Moorish dance) at the opera's end are a separate group (che fecero la moresca nel fine). Little information is available about who sang the various roles in the first performance. A letter published at Mantua in 1612 records that the distinguished tenor and composer Francesco Rasi took part, and it is generally assumed that he sang the title role. Rasi could sing in both the tenor and bass ranges \\"with exquisite style ... and extraordinary feeling\\". The involvement in the premiere of a Florentine castrato, Giovanni Gualberto Magli, is confirmed by correspondence between the Gonzaga princes. Magli sang the prologue, Proserpina and possibly one other role, either La messaggera or Speranza. The musicologist and historian Hans Redlich mistakenly allocates Magli to the role of Orfeo.A clue about who played Euridice is contained in a 1608 letter to Duke Vincenzo. It refers to \\"that little priest who performed the role of Euridice in the Most Serene Prince's Orfeo\\". This priest was possibly Padre Girolamo Bacchini, a castrato known to have had connections to the Mantuan court in the early 17th century. The Monteverdi scholar Tim Carter speculates that two prominent Mantuan tenors, Pandolfo Grande and Francesco Campagnola may have sung minor roles in the premiere.There are solo parts for four shepherds and three spirits. Carter calculates that through the doubling of roles that the text allows, a total of ten singers—three sopranos, two altos, three tenors and two basses—is required for a performance, with the soloists (except Orfeo) also forming the chorus. Carter's suggested role-doublings include La musica with Euridice, Ninfa with Proserpina and La messaggera with Speranza.

Given the question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Winter is dangerous because it's so difficult to know what is going to happen and accidents take place so easily. Fog can be waiting to meet you over the top of a hill. Ice might be hiding under the melting snow, waiting ahead to send you off the road. The car coming to you may suddenly slip across the road. Rule Number One for driving on icy roads is to drive smoothly . Sudden movements can make a car very difficult to control. So every time you either start or stop your car, increase or reduce your speed, you must be as gentle and slow as possible. Suppose you are driving with a full cup of hot coffee on the seat next to you. Drive so that you wouldn't spill  it. Rule Number Two is to pay attention to what might happen. The more ice there is, the further down the road you have to look. Test how long it takes to gently stop your car. Remember that you may be driving more quickly than you think. Generally, allow twice of your usual stopping distance when the road is wet, three times this distance on snow, and even more on ice. Try to stay in control of your car at all times and you will not get into trouble.

In clssical theory, if Rob needs to find out the object with stronger gravitational pull, which one would he choose, earth or asteroid A?  Rob is an amateur astronomer. Recently, he detected four asteroids, asteroid A, asteroid B, asteroid C, and asteroid D. Asteroid A and asteroid B are of the same mass, but asteroid A is farther from the earth than asteroid B. Asteroid C and asteroid D are at the same distance form the earth, but asteroid C has more mass than asteroid D. He also figured out that all of these asteroids have less mass than earth.  Hint: The classical explanation of gravity is that a force of attraction acts at a distance between two objects and the magnitude of the force is directly proportional to each of the masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the objects. The objects move toward each other due to this force of attraction. Einstein’s new concept of gravity states that matter (mass) causes the space around the matter to curve and also distorts time. A straight line through this curved space would also be curved in order to be a straight line.

Section 1 - What are Smart Playlists? Smart playlists are an amazing feature that allows iTunes to create customized playlists for you based on a wide range of parameters. Rather than manually adding each song to your playlist, smart playlists generate a dynamic collection of tunes that match your specified criteria. This means you can create a playlist that changes over time, keeping your listening experience fresh and exciting. Section 2 - Setting Up Smart Playlists To begin creating a smart playlist, follow these steps: 1. Open iTunes and navigate to the \\"File\\" menu. 2. Select \\"New\\" and then \\"Smart Playlist\\". 3. Before proceeding, ensure that the \\"Match The Following Rule\\" box is checked.

Click the \\"+\\" button to add new rules. You can select from a wide range of options, including song title, artist, album, genre, year of release, rating, play count, and more. 5. After defining your rules, you can choose to limit your playlist by a specific number of items or the total duration of the playlist. This is particularly useful if you want to limit your playlist for a workout or a specific duration of time. 6. Finally, check the \\"live updating\\" option before clicking \\"OK\\". This allows your playlist to stay automatically up to date as you add more songs to your library that meet your defined criteria. Section 3 - What are Genius Playlists?

Problem: Solve -27*g - 18*g = -28*g + 61*g + 1092 for g. And the answer is...","output":"To solve the equation -27g - 18g = -28g + 61g + 1092 for g, we will follow these steps: 1. Combine like terms on both sides of the equation. 2. Isolate g on one side of the equation. 3. Solve for g. Step 1: Combine like terms on both sides of the equation. -27g - 18g = -28g + 61g -45g = 33g + 1092 Step 2: Isolate g on one side of the equation. To isolate g, we'll add 45g to both sides of the equation. -45g + 45g = 33g + 45g + 1092 0 = 78g + 1092 Step 3: Solve for g. To solve for g, we'll subtract 1092 from both sides of the equation, then divide by 78. (0 - 1092) = 78g + 1092 - 1092 -1092 = 78g Now, we'll divide both sides by 78. -1092 / 78 = 78g / 78 -14 = g So, the solution to the equation is g = -14."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A. breathe  B. sky  C. build a nest  D. pick berries  E. reproduce  The best answer is A:","output":"In August, the birds were primarily looking to engage in activities related to their natural seasonal behaviors, and the best answer to this question would be D. pick berries. During this time of the year, migratory birds prepare for their journey southward, while other birds start the process of gathering food for the upcoming months. At this point in the season, many delicious, nutrient-rich berries have ripened and are becoming available. Birds are aware of the changing environment and abundance of food during August, and they are instinctively driven to gather and consume these berries. Berries provide a critical source of energy and nutrients for birds as they prepare themselves for the cooler months ahead or for their migration to warmer climates. Picking berries helps them maintain their physical health and store the energy necessary for the challenges ahead. Some bird species, like the American Robin, Cedar Waxwing, and Eastern Bluebird, are especially attracted to berries as an essential part of their diet. As for the other answer choices: A. While it is true that birds need to breathe to stay alive, this option is not the primary reason they are looking around in August, as breathing is a constant biological requirement, regardless of the month. B. Sky does not represent a specific activity or goal for the birds in August, making it an invalid choice. C. Building a nest is not the primary focus for birds in August, as most birds have already constructed their nests in the previous months (usually in spring) for raising their offspring. However, some birds may still carry out nesting activities if their first nesting attempt has failed, or if they are a multi-brood species. E. Reproduction is generally not the primary goal for birds during August. Bird breeding season typically occurs in spring, when food resources such as insects are more abundant for feeding their offspring. While not impossible, it is less likely for birds to reproduce during August compared to earlier months. In conclusion, the best answer is \\"D. pick berries\\" because birds are mostly engaged in gathering valuable food resources in August, such as berries to prepare for the upcoming challenges of migration or the cooler months."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer is:","output":"Yes, the statement provided is a reasonable answer to the question, \\"What is non-binding?\\" A non-binding arbitration means that the decision made by the arbitrator during the arbitration process is not legally enforceable, and the parties involved are not obligated to follow the arbitrator's recommendations or ruling. In this case, the arbitration serves as a form of guidance for the parties in helping them reach a resolution to their dispute. The statement accurately reflects that after a non-binding arbitration, the parties have the option to pursue their claims further through a court trial or a binding arbitration, where the decision would be enforceable. However, it is also important to note that reaching a settlement is the most common outcome after a non-binding arbitration, as the parties have already had an opportunity to discuss and attempt to resolve their issues through the non-binding arbitration process."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Question: How does the dark haired woman choose the name Rita? If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Mulholland Drive Context: The story may not be linear and exhibits several instances of temporal disruption. A dark-haired woman (Harring) escapes her own murder, surviving a car accident on Mulholland Drive. Injured and in shock, she descends into Los Angeles and sneaks into an apartment that an older, red-headed woman has just vacated. An aspiring actress named Betty Elms (Watts) arrives at the same apartment and finds the dark-haired woman confused, not knowing her own name. The dark-haired woman assumes the name \\"Rita\\" after seeing a poster for the film Gilda (1946), starring Rita Hayworth. To help Rita remember her identity, Betty looks in Rita's purse, where she finds a large amount of money and an unusual blue key. In what seems to be a scene from a different narrative, set at a diner called Winkies, a man (Patrick Fischler) tells his companion (Michael Cooke) about a nightmare in which he dreamt there was a horrible figure behind the diner. When they investigate, the figure appears, causing the man with the nightmare to collapse in fright. As the principal narrative resumes, Hollywood director Adam Kesher (Justin Theroux) has his film commandeered by apparent mobsters, who insist he cast an unknown actress named Camilla Rhodes (Melissa George) as the lead in his film. After he resists, he returns home to find his wife having an affair and is thrown out of his house. He later learns that his bank has closed his line of credit and he is broke. He agrees to meet a mysterious figure called The Cowboy, who urges him to cast Camilla Rhodes for his own good. Later, a bungling hit man (Mark Pellegrino) attempts to steal a book full of phone numbers and leaves three people dead. Trying to learn more about Rita's accident, Betty and Rita go to Winkies and are served by a waitress named Diane, which causes Rita to remember the name \\"Diane Selwyn\\".

A:","output":"In the movie Mulholland Drive, the dark-haired woman chooses the name Rita when she, along with Betty Elms, come across a poster for the film Gilda (1946) starring Rita Hayworth. The dark-haired woman, who is suffering from amnesia after her attempted murder and a car accident on Mulholland Drive, assumes the name \\"Rita\\" after seeing the poster as she does not remember her own name. Throughout the rest of the movie, Betty takes it upon herself to help Rita uncover her true identity, leading them on a mysterious and nonlinear journey through Los Angeles.  As the storyline unfolds, viewers are exposed to themes of corruption, deception, and illusion in the Hollywood industry while the characters battle their inner demons and strive to find the truth about themselves. The naming of the character Rita is a reference to an iconic Hollywood actress, Rita Hayworth, which ties into the storyline's exploration of the glamorous and dark sides of Hollywood. The choice of the name \\"Rita\\" is symbolic of the blending of realities and illusions, while also serving as a simple way for the character to choose a name while struggling with her amnesia and lost identity. The journey that Rita and Betty embark on together blends different narratives and timeframes, which further highlights the movie's disjointed, dreamlike nature and mysterious plot."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Super market delivery man The answer is:","output":"Title: A Supermarket Hero Plot Summary: The film revolves around Doob, an unassuming yet dedicated supermarket delivery man in a small American town. His life is thrown into chaos when he discovers a potentially world-threatening conspiracy in his seemingly innocuous deliveries. He inadvertently gets entangled in a web of mystery, danger, and adventure, all while doing the one job he loves most: delivering groceries. Plot Outline: Act 1: 1. Introduction: Doob is introduced as an ordinary, kind, and somewhat introverted individual in his late 20s. He has a stable, if low-paying job as a supermarket delivery man. He enjoys the simple life, and shares a close bond with his customers. 2. Fleeting Dreams: Despite his contentment, Doob occasionally dreams about a more exciting life, but brushes it aside, assuming such adventures only happen to other people. 3. The Unusual Delivery: One day, Doob picks up a delivery order for a new entity in town, a research lab operating on the outskirts. He delivers the package without any fuss, but something about the interaction piqued his curiosity. Act 2: 4. Doob's Discovery: Over the next few deliveries, Doob starts noticing strange patterns in the packages he delivers to the lab. He soon uncovers that the packages contain the components for building a powerful and dangerous device, which could potentially wreak havoc on a global scale. 5. Reluctant Heroism: Doob grapples with his conscience about whether or not to delve deeper into the mystery of the device and expose the conspiracy. He shares his findings with his best friend, Shelby, who convinces him that he must act to save the world. 6. Gathering Allies: Together, Doob and Shelby assemble a group of quirky and resourceful friends who, despite their shared inexperience, pledge to do whatever they can to stop the dangerous device from being built. They turn to Frank, a disgruntled lab employee disillusioned with the project, who then offers to work as their inside man. Act 3: 7. Mission Impossible: Doob and his team hatch a plan to break into the lab and sabotage the device. Using their inside intelligence, they go through a series of tense and action-packed scenarios, narrowly avoiding capture at every turn. 8. Climactic Battle: Just as they think they have succeeded, they confront the mastermind behind the plot, Dr. Wraith, who, having anticipated their infiltration, is ready for a confrontation. He reveals his true intentions: he believes that human overconsumption is leading the planet to ruin, and the device he plans to activate will force the world to reduce its demand for resources, instigating a new era of sustainability and conservation. 9. Resolution and Sacrifice: Doob tries to reason with Dr. Wraith, offering to find non-violent alternatives to protect the environment, but the mad doctor is unyielding. In a desperate attempt to save the world, Doob and his team disable the device and defeat Dr. Wraith and his goons. Frank sacrifices himself to ensure the mission's success, further uniting the team and giving them closure. Epilogue: 10. New Beginnings: The events bring renewed life to the town and Doob's once mundane job now holds newfound importance and prestige as he resumes his role as the supermarket delivery man - but with a heightened sense of adventure and newfound respect from the community. The close friendships formed throughout this journey have further enriched Doob's life, all while remaining true to his life's purpose: being a part of the daily life of his beloved town. \\"A Supermarket Hero\\" is an action-comedy film that emphasizes the importance of environmental awareness, the heroism in everyday people, and the power of friendship.

Agathe knows that Guillaume had a lover , but believes that it was a young woman , Guillaume and Tom 's co-worker Sarah . Are these two sentences paraphrases of each other?","output":"Yes, these two sentences are indeed paraphrases of each other. A paraphrase is a restatement of the meaning of a text or passage using other words. The goal is to retain the original idea but to express it in a new form, essentially saying the same thing with different words and sentence structure. In this case, both the sentences, \\"Agathe knows Guillaume had a lover, but believes it was a young woman, Guillaume and Tom's co-worker Sarah.\\" and \\"Agathe knows that Guillaume had a lover, but believes that it was a young woman, Guillaume and Tom's co-worker Sarah.\\" are expressing the same idea.  Both convey the same information that Agathe is aware of Guillaume having an affair, and she presupposes it was with Sarah, a colleague of Guillaume and Tom, who is described as a young woman. The structure of the sentences and the way the ideas are formulated might vary slightly but they carry the same intrinsic meaning. The sentence structure in the first version is more direct and compact by juxtaposing the main clause with two micro clauses afterward. The second version uses more connecting words, specifically the word \\"that\\", which is used to enhance clarity and readability. While they are not identical in structure, they are functionally equivalent, thus they can be referred to as paraphrases.

Write some highlights for the following article: There was widespread outrage among UEFA delegates at their meeting ahead of the FIFA Congress when the £16million outlay on Sepp Blatter’s vanity project film was discussed. The European representatives were aghast that Blatter should commit so much money — more than the annual turnover of most of UEFA’s national associations — to the FIFA history film United Passions, which was launched at the Cannes Film Festival last month. When Sports Agenda first revealed the sum Blatter had agreed to put into the project — against staff advice — Zurich claimed the true figure was far lower. Under fire: FIFA president Sepp blatter has been criticised by UEFA delegates. But financial director Markus Kattner, who rubber stamped the decision without the knowledge of a number of FIFA executive committee members, confirmed it was £16m this week. Kattner added that it was agreed at the 2009 Congress and included in FIFA’s 2010 financial report as a World Cup budget entry. But it is understandable that representatives from FIFA’s main decision-making committee knew nothing about this increasingly murky affair when their independent audit overseer Domenico Scala acknowledged it was a ‘single line entry’ without a purpose being specified. Spilling the beans: FIFA's finance administrator has confirmed the £16m sum used to make the film. FIFA will have to spend upwards of £1million on sending blood and urine samples from World Cup drugs tests to Switzerland after Rio’s poorly-equipped laboratory had its accreditation removed. World Anti-Doping Agency president Sir Craig Reedie will hold talks in Rio on Saturday to make sure preparations for a new lab for the 2016 Olympics are on course. Brazil Games chief Carlos Nuzman has invited Reedie to dinner, making sure it did not clash with the England game. Craig pointed out it would not be a problem as he is Scottish. Sepp Blatter has easily seen off all challengers to his FIFA presidency but UEFA chief Michel Platini is playing a canny game. Platini, whose FIFA election contention has shifted from definitely not to maybe, is wisely keeping options open to see how far Blatter’s reputation is tarnished from the Qatar scandal and the fall-out from Brazil’s shambolic World Cup preparation. Keeping his options open: Michel Platini with Blatter on Wednesday. Meanwhile, the criticism by David Gill, who rarely speaks in public, of Blatter’s ridiculous claims of racism against the British press is seen as a clear sign of him emerging as a candidate to be the next UEFA president. Both the BBC and ITV will have backdrops of Copacabana Beach and Sugarloaf Mountain from their purpose-built Rio broadcasting positions. The BBC facilities are bigger and no wonder, as they have sent 272 personnel to Brazil compared to ITV’s 123. Meanwhile, Sky Sports administrator Brendan Henry is considering bringing home two of Sky Sports News’s four crews in Brazil after FIFA barred non rights holders from pre-match access to World Cup stadiums. Delayed: England's journey from their hotel to the training base is becoming a nightmare. England’s journey from their hotel to their training base must be causing concern. First predicted to take 20 minutes, the eight-mile trip initially took 39 minutes, then 45 and on Wednesday lasted 55 minutes, with the extra delays blamed on protests on the Copacabana. There have been no signs of the priority lanes promised to the FA, while there is no chance of a rebellious Rio public observing the Olympic lanes that must be installed for the 2016 Games. A 2016 spokesman said lane details were under discussion. Things are no better in Sao Paulo, where FIFA executive committee members endured four-hour journeys from the airport and saw delegates bussed in at 7am yesterday to avoid the traffic chaos. Perhaps they may now be looking forward to the World Cup in Qatar, where all stadiums are in a 75-mile radius. Charm offensive: James Milner and team-mate Phil Jagielka have met fans. It may all go pear-shaped in Manaus on Friday, but the FA charm offensive has continued through the week in Miami and up to the eve of the team travelling to the Amazon city, with England players Phil Jagielka and James Milner staging a meet and greet with fans at a hotel near the team’s Royal Tulip base. Highlights:","output":"- UEFA delegates express outrage over £16 million spent on Sepp Blatter's vanity project film, \\"United Passions.\\" - The amount is more than the annual turnover of most of UEFA's national associations. - FIFA's finance administrator confirms the £16 million sum for the film, which was criticized by UEFA delegates. - FIFA's financial director Markus Kattner rubber-stamped the decision without the knowledge of several FIFA executive committee members. - The decision to fund the film was made at the 2009 Congress and included in FIFA's 2010 financial report as a World Cup budget entry. - Domenico Scala, FIFA's independent audit overseer, acknowledges the amount as a \\"single line entry\\" without a specific purpose. - UEFA chief Michel Platini is playing a strategic game, potentially considering a bid for the FIFA presidency depending on Blatter's reputation fallout from the Qatar scandal and Brazil's World Cup preparation issues. - David Gill's criticism of Blatter is seen as a sign of his potential candidacy for the next UEFA president role."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. One of the challenges that every community faces, particularly teams inside a larger community, is the ability to coordinate what goals and ambitions the team is going to work on. Traditionally this has always been somewhat ad-hoc: people join a team and work on whatever they feel like. Ideas are ten-a-penny though. For most teams that work on larger projects (such as events, software, products and more) to actually be productive, coordinating this work can be complex: some projects require coordination across many people with different skill-sets, time-availability and resources. Something I would like us to work towards in the Ubuntu community is encouraging a culture of best-practise in how we plan our work and coordinate our awesome teams to work together on projects. I believe this kind of coordination can help our teams increase the opportunity for success in their work, feel more empowered and productive and provide greater insight to people outside those teams on what the team is doing. An effective way of doing this is to build a Roadmap for each cycle. This provides an opportunity to capture a set of goals the team will work together to achieve in each six-month period. This article outlines how to build such a Roadmap. While at first a roadmap can feel a little like a nod to the gods of bureaucracy, they actually possess many benefits: * Direction – one of the biggest complaints teams often report is a lack of direction. If a team gets into the habit of creating a roadmap at the beginning of a cycle, it gives the team a sense of focus and direction for the coming cycle. * Documented commitments are more effective – a common rule in Project Management training is that actions assigned to people in a shared document are more effective than ad-hoc or private commitments. By documenting who will work on what in a cycle and putting their name next to an action can help seal a sense of accountability for their contributions to the project. * Feeling of success – regularly revisiting a roadmap and...

Question: Given the following context:  Elgar was contemptuous of folk music and had little interest in or respect for the early English composers, calling William Byrd and his contemporaries \\"museum pieces\\". Of later English composers, he regarded Purcell as the greatest, and he said that he had learned much of his own technique from studying Hubert Parry's writings. The continental composers who most influenced Elgar were Handel, Dvořák and, to some degree, Brahms. In Elgar's chromaticism, the influence of Wagner is apparent, but Elgar's individual style of orchestration owes much to the clarity of nineteenth-century French composers, Berlioz, Massenet, Saint-Saëns and, particularly, Delibes, whose music Elgar played and conducted at Worcester and greatly admired.Elgar began composing when still a child, and all his life he drew on his early sketchbooks for themes and inspiration. The habit of assembling his compositions, even large-scale ones, from scraps of themes jotted down randomly remained throughout his life. His early adult works included violin and piano pieces, music for the wind quintet in which he and his brother played between 1878 and 1881, and music of many types for the Powick Asylum band. Diana McVeagh in Grove's Dictionary finds many embryonic Elgarian touches in these pieces, but few of them are regularly played, except Salut d'Amour and (as arranged decades later into The Wand of Youth Suites) some of the childhood sketches. Elgar's sole work of note during his first spell in London in 1889–91, the overture Froissart, was a romantic-bravura piece, influenced by Mendelssohn and Wagner, but also showing further Elgarian characteristics. Orchestral works composed during the subsequent years in Worcestershire include the Serenade for Strings and Three Bavarian Dances. In this period and later, Elgar wrote songs and partsongs. W. H. Reed expressed reservations about these pieces, but praised the partsong The Snow, for female voices, and Sea Pictures, a cycle of five songs for contralto and orchestra which remains in the...  answer the following question:  What is the name of the person whose orchestral skills had been building up throughout the decade, according to McVeagh?

The Kinsey scale has been praised for dismissing the dichotomous classification of sexual orientation and allowing for a new perspective on human sexuality. However, the scale has been criticized because it is still not a true continuum. Despite seven categories being able to provide a more accurate description of sexual orientation than a dichotomous scale it is still difficult to determine which category individuals should be assigned to. In a major study comparing sexual response in homosexual males and females, Masters and Johnson discuss the difficulty of assigning the Kinsey ratings to participants. Particularly, they found it difficult to determine the relative amount heterosexual and homosexual experience and response in a person's history when using the scale. They report finding it difficult to assign ratings 2-4 for individuals with a large number of heterosexual and homosexual experiences. When, there is a lot of heterosexual and homosexual experiences in one's history it becomes difficult for that individual to be fully objective in assessing the relative amount of each. If it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): In a study by Masters and Johnson what did the find difficult about KIneys ratings?","output":"In a study by Masters and Johnson, they found it difficult to assign Kinsey ratings, particularly in the range of 2 to 4, to participants with a large number of both heterosexual and homosexual experiences. The reason for this difficulty was that it became challenging to determine the relative amount of heterosexual and homosexual experiences and responses in a person's history when using the Kinsey scale. According to the researchers, when an individual has a significant number of both types of experiences, it becomes difficult for them to be fully objective in assessing the relative amount of each experience, thus making it harder to assign an accurate Kinsey rating. This highlights one of the limitations of the Kinsey scale and suggests that a more nuanced and granular approach may be necessary for understanding and categorizing the complexities of human sexuality."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Twins of Evil Context: Maria and Frieda, recently orphaned identical twin teenage girls, move from Venice to Karnstein in Central Europe to live with their uncle Gustav Weil. Weil is a stern puritan and leader of the fanatical witch-hunting 'Brotherhood'. Both twins resent their uncle's sternness and one of them, Frieda, looks for a way to escape. Resenting her uncle, she becomes fascinated by the local Count Karnstein, who has the reputation of being \\"a wicked man\\". Count Karnstein, who enjoys the Emperor's favour and thus remains untouched by the Brotherhood, is indeed wicked and interested in Satanism and Black Magic. Trying to emulate his evil ancestors, he murders a girl as a Human Sacrifice, calling forth Countess Mircalla Karnstein from her grave. Mircalla turns the Count into a vampire. Frieda, following an invitation from the Count, steals away to the castle at night, while Maria covers for her absence. In the castle, the Count transforms Frieda into a vampire, offering her a beautiful young chained victim. Returning home, Frieda threatens Maria to keep covering for her nightly excursions, but secretly fearing she might bite her sister. Meanwhile, Maria becomes interested in the handsome young teacher, Anton, who is initially infatuated with the more mysterious Frieda. Anton has studied what he calls \\"superstition\\", but becomes convinced of the existence of vampires when his sister falls victim to one. One night, when Frieda attacks a member of the Brotherhood, she is captured by her uncle and put in jail. While the Brotherhood debates the vampire woman's fate, the Count and his servants kidnap Maria and exchange her for Frieda in the cell. Anton goes to see Maria, not knowing that she is actually Frieda. She tries to seduce him, but he sees her lack of reflection in a mirror and repels her with a cross. Anton rushes to rescue Maria from burning. Maria kisses a cross, revealing her innocence. Weil now listens to Anton's advice on the proper ways to fight vampires, and the two men lead the Brotherhood and villagers to... Answer:","output":"Maria's innocence is revealed when Anton rushes to rescue her from the impending danger of being burned. As the villagers are under the impression that Maria has become a vampire, they are determined to burn her. However, her true nature starts to unveil as she kisses a cross in desperation, thereby proving her innocence. A vampire would have been unable to kiss the cross without revealing their wicked nature. The cross serves as a symbol of purity and holiness, which a vampire cannot touch without harming oneself. Upon witnessing her action, the villagers realize that they had mistaken Maria for her twin sister, Frieda, who had been turned into a vampire by Count Karnstein. The error is understandable since the sisters are identical twins, and it is not uncommon for one sibling to bear the consequences of the other's actions, especially when appearances are entirely indistinguishable. The revelation of Maria's innocence not only saves her from a terrible fate but also enables her genuine, good-hearted nature to shine through. This newfound understanding enables Weil, Anton, and the rest of the Brotherhood to focus their efforts on combating the true evil in their midst: the vampires, specifically Count Karnstein and Frieda. Guided by Anton's advice on how to properly fight and defeat vampires, they gather their forces with renewed determination to protect their village and put an end to the vampires' reign of terror."},{"instruction":"Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: Which magazine got published first, Nova or Mademoiselle?

Greeted by throngs of Catholic worshipers from across the region, Pope Benedict XVI ended his two-country tour in Havana's Revolution Plaza with a reference to what he described as a need for \\"authentic freedom.\\" Changes between Cuba and the world can come only if \\"each one is prepared to ask for the truth and if they decide to take the path of love, sowing reconciliation and brotherhood,\\" the pope said Wednesday. He also met with the Communist country's former leader, Fidel Castro, before heading to the airport for a Rome-bound flight Wednesday evening. Conflicting reports emerged Wednesday over whether the pope had met with Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez. Two Cuban sources told CNN the pontiff met Tuesday with Chavez, who is in Cuba for cancer treatment. But Vatican spokesman Federico Lombardi said reports of the meeting were false. In a farewell speech just before boarding the plane, he criticized the U.S. trade embargo on Cuba, saying \\"restrictive economic measures, imposed from outside the country, unfairly burden its people.\\" Benedict, whose office has routinely cast the trip in the context of a spiritual pilgrimage, at times addressed political issues -- often subtly, and on occasion more overtly. At the start of his visit, aboard a flight from Rome, he denounced violence caused by the drug war in Mexico and blasted Cuba's Marxist political system by saying it \\"no longer corresponds to reality.\\" Later, he prayed for \\"those deprived of freedom\\" while in Cuba's southeastern city of Santiago de Cuba. And he made several references to freedom in his final sermon in Havana, addressing a nation that human rights groups have routinely denounced for its abuses. Many in Cuba and around the world listened closely to the pope's homily at the enormous open-air Mass Wednesday to see whether he would expand on -- or be more forceful in -- his apparent criticisms. But his comments often seemed couched in a broader discussion of religious openness. \\"It is with joy that in Cuba there have been steps so that the church can carry out its mission,\\" but the country must continue to strengthen this path, he said. Tens of thousands of faithful packed Revolution Plaza to hear Wednesday's Mass. The pope arrived in the so-called popemobile, his bulletproof vehicle, which slowly made its way to the altar. At some points, he appeared just a few feet from the crowd, which shifted as onlookers tried to get a closer look. Rescue workers carried away at least three people who fainted in what was a comparably mild Caribbean heat, after waiting for hours for the pope to arrive. \\"Every time the pontiff comes comes here, there's always some sort of transformative period for us afterward,\\" said Jorge Luis Rodriguez, a Havana resident who joined the thousands that filled the square on Wednesday. But Cuban dissidents complained that police prohibited some activists from leaving their homes to attend the Mass and that others were detained. Amnesty International said in a statement that activists were \\"facing a surge in harassment in a bid to silence them during the pope's visit.\\" Government opponents were detained, threatened or stopped from traveling freely leading up to pontiff's arrival, according to the human rights group. \\"The clampdown has seen an increase in arrests, activists' phones have been disconnected, and some have had their houses surrounded to prevent them (from) denouncing abuses during Pope Benedict's tour,\\" the group said. CNN could not independently confirm those reports. The pope's visit comes 14 years after Pope John Paul II addressed massive crowds near the towering sculpture of Che Guevara in the historic first papal visit to the island nation. Elsida Martinez, a Havana resident who said she watched from the square when John Paul spoke in 1998, said there was a noticeable difference between the two pontiffs. Cuba itself was also different, she said. \\"When we saw John Paul, Cubans didn't really know anything about religion,\\" Martinez said. \\"Now we're open more. We practice (religion) more. We believe more.\\" When John Paul came \\"it was a different period in our history,\\" said Camilo Ortiz, a 50-year-old Havana resident, but the former pontiff's visit still \\"had more power\\" than Benedict's. \\"During that time, there were many difficulties here,\\" Ortiz added. \\"Now, there are some changes, and things are a little better.\\" After the island's so-called \\"special period,\\" which began in the early 1990s after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Cuba -- which had long enjoyed Soviet subsidies -- was confronted with a prolonged period of economic hardship. When John Paul visited years later, the country was still reeling from its effects. Cuba is Benedict's second stop on a tour that has also taken him to Mexico, where he denounced the violence-plagued drug war before traveling to the island nation. \\"In Cuba, there will not be political reform,\\" said Marino Murillo, vice president of the island's council of ministers, responding to the pope's remarks about its Marxist political system. But some Havana residents at Wednesday's Mass said they were optimistic. \\"For me, there's a hope\\" that comes with Benedict's visit, Ortiz said. \\"There's a hope that something's going to change.\\" Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"Pope Benedict XVI concluded his two-country tour in Havana's Revolution Plaza, where he was greeted by a large number of Catholic worshipers.

Question: Given the following context:  In 1947, Walton was presented with the Royal Philharmonic Society's Gold Medal. In the same year he accepted an invitation from the BBC to compose his first opera. He decided to base it on Chaucer's Troilus and Criseyde, but his preliminary work came to a halt in April 1948 when Alice Wimborne died. To take Walton's mind off his grief, the music publisher Leslie Boosey persuaded him to be a British delegate to a conference on copyright in Buenos Aires later that year.  While there, Walton met Susana Gil Passo (1926–2010), daughter of an Argentine lawyer. At 22 she was 24 years younger than Walton (Alice Wimborne had been 22 years his senior), and at first she ridiculed his romantic interest in her. He persisted, and she eventually accepted his proposal of marriage. The wedding was held in Buenos Aires in December 1948. From the start of their marriage, the couple spent half the year on the Italian island of Ischia, and by the mid-1950s they lived there permanently.Walton's last work of the 1940s was his music for Olivier's film of Hamlet (1948). After that, he focused his attentions on his opera Troilus and Cressida. On the advice of the BBC, he invited Christopher Hassall to write the libretto. This did not help Walton's relations with the Sitwells, each of whom thought he or she should have been asked to be his librettist. Work continued slowly over the next few years, with many breaks while Walton turned to other things. In 1950 he and Heifetz recorded the Violin Concerto for EMI. In 1951 Walton was knighted. In the same year, he prepared an authorised version of Façade, which had undergone many revisions since its premiere. In 1953, following the accession of Elizabeth II he was again called on to write a coronation march, Orb and Sceptre; he was also commissioned to write a choral setting of the Te Deum for the occasion.Troilus and Cressida was presented at Covent Garden on 3 December 1954. Its preparation was dogged by misfortunes. Olivier, originally scheduled to direct it, backed out, as did Henry...  answer the following question:  What is the last name of the person whose preliminary work came to a halt in April 1948?

Here is a news article: A ]wave of fetish-related Google searches followed the most recent episode of 11.22.63, after a scene introduced a form of masochism involving genitals and a clothespin. It was weird. But how weird was it, really?      The holy bible of judgmental psychiatric boards everywhere — the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) — defines “paraphilic” sexual interests as unusual or anomalous. But the basis for those judgments isn’t exactly clear.      In an article published this week in The Journal of Sex Research, researchers asked: Is something actually unusual if a lot of people do it?      To find out, the team from University of Quebec at Trois-Rivieres and Philippe Pinel Institute of Montreal took to computer screens and phone lines of Quebec, surveying a sample of 1,040 people. Classified according to factors like age, gender, religious affiliation and education, the group was thought to represent the province’s norms.      Voyeurism, classified by the DSM as a paraphilic behavior, is surprisingly common.      The researchers probed participants’ interests in the eight paraphilic behaviors listed in the DSM: voyeurism, exhibitionism, frotteurism (touching or rubbing against a non-consenting individual), masochism, sadism, pedophilia, fetishism (technically, using nonliving objects or having a highly specific focus on non-genital body parts), and transvestic disorder (engaging in sexually arousing cross-dressing to the point of distress or harm).      Because the authors focused only on the behaviors themselves — not the way in which people engaged in them — it’s especially important to note the difference between a paraphilic behavior and disorder. Paraphilias aren’t considered mental disorders — they’re simply sexual preferences for “unusual” behavior — and paraphilic behavior is only engaged in from time to time. Yet paraphilic disorder, by definition, involves non-consenting partners and causes suffering or confusion.      Of all of the random Quebecois surveyed, almost half expressed interest in at least one type of paraphilia, and about one-third had actually acted on those desires at least once.      Interest in voyeurism, fetishism, frotteurism, and masochism, in particular, was high enough — at 15.9 percent of both men and women surveyed — to be considered “statistically unusual.”      Oddly — or perhaps not — masochism was significantly linked to a more satisfying sex life. Although men were generally more interested in paraphilic behavior than women, the authors point out that women who were interested in sexual submission were actually more drawn to more diverse sexual interests.      Original Large Genitalia Could Lead to Extinction      It’s time to reassess how we define normal and anomalous sexual behaviors, the authors write. Labeling paraphilias as abnormal, when they aren’t in the practical sense, could stigmatize and shame when it’s unnecessary — which is something the DSM has more than enough experience with.      Lest readers think the Quebecois are simply a rarefied, sexually liberated bunch, the authors point out that they “have reasons to believe that this study’s results which are based on Quebec’s population can be applied to the population of North America and Europe as well.” ||||| Do you have normal sexual tastes? A new study suggests sexual fantasies, urges and behaviours that are often considered abnormal are actually quite common among the general population, raising questions about how psychiatrists and psychologists define what is sexually normal or not.      The study, published online in The Journal of Sex Research, examined the prevalence of paraphilic, or anomalous, sexual interests, as identified in the widely used Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), among residents of Quebec. It found that participants’ experiences and their desire to experience certain paraphilic behaviours, including fetishism and masochism, are neither rare nor unusual.      While some paraphilic behaviours, such as pedophilia, exhibitionism and voyeurism, are illegal and involve a non-consensual party, certain others should not be labelled abnormal, says the study’s co-author, Christian Joyal, a professor of psychology at the University of Quebec at Trois-Rivières and the Institut Philippe-Pinel de Montréal.      “If people are happy, if everybody is consenting, I don’t know why it should be abnormal, especially in 2016,” Joyal says.      The researchers used online and telephone surveys to ask 1,040 Quebec residents, aged 16 to 64, about their sexual desires and behaviours. Nearly half the respondents reported a desire to experience at least one paraphilic behaviour and around a third of them had engaged in a paraphilic behaviour at least once. The most common was voyeurism – surreptitiously watching strangers when they are nude, undressing or having sex. That was followed by fetishism – sexual arousal by an inanimate, non-sexual object; frotteurism – touching or rubbing oneself against a stranger; and masochism – sexual arousal while suffering, being dominated or humiliated.      The researchers note that the current edition of the DSM, updated in 2013, defines normal, or “normalphilic,” sexual interest as “interest in genital stimulation or preparatory fondling with phenotypically normal, physically mature, consenting human partners.” Anything else is not necessarily disordered, but is considered paraphilic or abnormal, Joyal says.      “Normalcy is really difficult to define and I don’t think it’s a good idea to try to do it,” he says.      The DSM offers eight examples of paraphilic interests: voyeurism, exhibitionism, frotteurism, masochism, sadism, pedophilia, fetishism and transvestism.      While interests such as fetishism are far from uncommon, Joyal says, other sexual interests such as pedophilia, necrophilia and bestiality are extremely rare.      He explains that a paraphilic interest can be considered a mental disorder if it causes suffering or impairment. The study looked at what are known as merely “anomalous” interests, and not disorders.      “Just asking people about their sex lives, I know it’s a bit taboo,” he says. “But still … you have to have evidence-based data before coming [up] with any definition, especially [with] such a sensitive topic like sexual behaviours.”      Report Typo/Error ||||| The \\"Fifty Shades of Gray\\" trilogy has made kinky sex mainstream, romanticizing the use of whips, chains, and handcuffs. Couples worldwide are buying BDSM (Bondage, Discipline, Dominance, Submission, Sadism and Masochism) sex toys, with sales up 400 percent in 2012. Sexual fantasies of being spanked or whipped, tied up, or forced to have sex have become commonplace, especially in women, but are these interests and behaviors abnormal?      In a recent study published in The Journal of Sex Research, researchers at the University of Montreal found sexual preferences classified as “anomalous” (abnormal) in psychiatry are actually very common, suggesting there is no such thing as “normal” when it comes to sex.      \\"The main goal of the study was to determine normal sexual desires and experiences in a representative sample of the general population,\\" said co-author Christian Joyal, in a statement.      Joyal and his colleague Julie Carpentier, both in institutions affiliated with the University of Montreal, surveyed a diverse group of over 1,000 Quebec residents on the phone and online about their sexual tastes and interests. The respondents were asked if they enjoyed sex acts that were considered anomalous by the latest Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5). Sex acts and behaviors listed as “paraphilic,” or atypical, include but are not limited to, voyeurism (joy of watching others have sex), fetishism (sexual arousal toward inanimate objects or body parts), frotteurism (dry-humping), and masochism (pleasure from pain or ridicule).      The findings revealed nearly half of the respondents were interested in at least one type of sexual behavior considered an anomalous paraphilia, whereas one third had experienced the behavior at least once. Out of the eight types of paraphilic behaviors listed in the DSM-5, four (voyeurism - 35 percent, fetishism - 26 percent, frotteurism - 26 percent, and masochism - 19 percent) were found to be common when it came to experiences or desires reported by men and women.      Although men tend to be more interested in paraphilic behaviors than women, women do have a strong interest. According to Joyal, women who report an interest in sexual submission have more varied sexual interests and report greater satisfaction with their sex lives. “Sexual submission is therefore not an abnormal interest,\\" he said.      An earlier study, also conducted by Joyal, found many women who have extreme submission fantasies, such as domination by a stranger, clearly state that they don’t actually want the fantasies to come true. More women than men fantasize about their current romantic partner. Clinically speaking, pathological sexual fantasies involve non-consenting partners, include pain, and are necessary for deriving satisfaction. But aside from that, what exactly is the definition of abnormal or atypical fantasies?      For example, half of the behaviors in Joyal’s recent study are legal, but frotteurism, for instance, is not because it’s by definition non-consensual.      This study suggests that some legal paraphilic behaviors are not as abnormal as previously thought, which is contrary to what is suggested by the DSM-5.      So when it comes to sex, the concept of normality can't truly exist because sexual satisfaction is personal.      Source: Joyal CC and Carpentier J.

Movie title: Flight of the Navigator Context: On the night of July 4, 1978 in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, 12-year-old David Scott Freeman walks through the woods to pick up his 8-year-old younger brother Jeff from a friend's house when he accidentally falls into a ravine and is knocked unconscious. When he comes to, he discovers that it is now the year 1986; while he hasn't aged at all, his parents are now middle-aged and Jeff is 16 years old. Meanwhile, an alien spaceship crashes through power lines and is promptly confiscated by NASA. David is taken to a hospital for tests, but is sent to a NASA research facility when his brainwaves reveal images of the spaceship. Dr. Louis Faraday, who has been studying the spaceship since its arrival, discovers that David's mind is filled with alien technical manuals and star charts covering expanses of the galaxy far exceeding anything humans have recorded. David's subconscious mind tells the scientists that he was taken to a planet called Phaelon, 560 light years away, in just over 4.4 hours. They realize that David has experienced severe time dilation as a result of having traveled faster than the speed of light, explaining why eight years have passed on Earth, but not for him. David is unable to comprehend what Faraday tells him and flees the room, leaving Faraday muttering that 48 hours will be insufficient to finish his investigation. The next morning, following a telepathic communication from the ship, David secretly boards it and meets its robotic commander called \\"Trimaxion Drone Ship\\" (or \\"Max\\" for short), which refers to David as the \\"Navigator\\". After they escape from the facility, Max tells David that its mission was to travel across the galaxy, collect biological specimens, take them to Phaelon for analysis, and then return them to their homes. Phaelon's scientists discovered humans only use 10% of their brain and, as an experiment, filled the remainder of David's with miscellaneous information. This includes all of the star charts discovered by Phaelon's astronomers, some of which were shown to the NASA...

I am always one to at least finish my shift if that happens then talking to my agency if it is agency work or some higher up boss if not. Never mind employers can ask you to leave at any time. After all, job hunting is a huge inconvenience. There is ONE exception to this rule: NOT GETTING PAID. I am not talking about if accounting messes up and you have to wait an extra day or two to get paid. If you are a good employer, I won’t be happy, but I am understanding. I am talking refusing to pay or being even rumored to be not paying. I am not in the volunteer business for business owners. Only happened once… I thought I had a part timer gig being a waiter at an over-priced tourist trap restaurant in the New Orleans French Quarter. As typical for these type of jobs, you do not get to actually wait tables and get tips till a training period is over. Somehow, I did not get the memo that this place did not have “training” but “auditions”, meaning all that silverware I rolled and floors I mopped and food I ran to tables I was not getting paid for! Add to that, if somehow they did not like me, after a week I would not have a job! Now, I understand actors and actresses go to auditions and not get paid all the time. I’ve known a few amateur actors. But, those auditions do not include showing up for a week to work unpaid so maybe you might get hired from talking to them… And waiters don’t do auditions! I left immediately. I think they owed me 30 bucks for half a day’s work at the minimum wage. Tried to go back threatening labor board and all that, but they would not be intimidated. They said there was no record of me being there and to get off property. I wrote it off to bad experience and started working another place that I had been interviewing with. Much better job.

The only interesting scene in the entire movie is the opening scene where Michael kills his sister, Judith, wearing his Halloween mask. The most startling moment in the whole film is when his parents rip the mask off to see their son killed their daughter. The film goes downhill from there and doesn't pick up until the last fifteen minutes, but by then it's too late, we the audience have lost all interest in the story. There is barely any character development, and people always rave about Laurie being such an exceptional heroine, when there really isn't much to her. I'm sorry to disagree with everyone terrified by this movie, but if you want a great horror movie go watch The Shining or Rosemary's Baby. Those are the two best horror films ever made. Halloween is certainly not in their ranks. I can't believe Roger Ebert gave it four stars, for there is no way this film could ever deserve such a high rating.","output":"The sentiment of this review is negative.

Following a botched contract, Martin receives an invitation to his 10 year high school reunion in his home town of Grosse Pointe, Michigan. Initially reluctant to attend, he is pressured into it by both his (understandably nervous) therapist (Alan Arkin) and his secretary (Joan Cusack), already booking him for a contract to re-establish ties with a disgruntled client over the botched contract.Upon arriving in Grosse Pointe, Martin seeks out Debi Newberry (Minnie Driver), now a radio DJ, whom Martin had abandoned on prom night to enlist in the Army. While Debi's visit suggests hope for redemption, Martin's subsequent visit to his family only heightens his depression; his father is dead, his mother is an emotionally disturbed resident of a nursing home and his childhood home has been demolished and replaced with a convenience store. Reconnecting with friends like Paul (Jeremy Piven) is likewise depressing, as many have integrated themselves with the local community through mundane establishment jobs.

Question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: This movie is about a divine intervention by a guardian angel, to help a man in distress. It opens with a a fanciful depiction of angels in heaven discussing a problem that has come up. They are receiving prayers from mortals, like \\"Please, God, something's the matter with Daddy\\". George Bailey (James Stewart) is about to kill himself, and they need to send an angel down to Earth to stop him. They select Clarence (Henry Travers), a somewhat down-on-his-luck angel who hasn't earned his wings yet, but who they decide is right for the job. The senior angels promise that Clarence will get his wings if he succeeds. The bulk of the movie is a replaying of George's life, by the senior angels and for Clarence's benefit, so that Clarence will understand George.George Bailey was a young man, living in a small town, but with big dreams. From an early age, he wanted to get away from Bedford Falls, travel the world, and accomplish big things--planning cities and building huge airfields, skyscrapers, and bridges. The first incident that Clarence sees is that, at age 12, George saved his younger brother Harry's (Todd Karns) life in an accident while playing on an ice-covered pond. George lost the hearing in his left ear due to being in the icy water. Shortly after that, while working part-time in Mr. Gower's (H.B. Warner) drug store, he prevents a mistake in a prescription from fatally poisoning someone. The two little girls in George's life at that point are Mary Hatch (Donna Reed) and Violet Bick (Gloria Grahame), who seem to be competing for his notice.George's father (Samuel S. Hinds), with a small staff including Uncle Billy (Thomas Mitchell), run a small Building and Loan company that finances mortgages for the people of Bedford Falls.

How much control does a sitting President have over economic growth during his or her term? Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","output":"The President of the United States has significant control over military affairs and economic growth during their term in office. However, these two questions are not paraphrases of each other, as each topic involves distinct areas of presidential influence. 1. Control over military affairs: The President serves as the Commander-in-Chief of the United States Armed Forces. This authority grants the President substantial power in managing and directing military affairs. Some of the key areas in which a President exercises control over military matters include: - Military Strategy: The President, in conjunction with the Pentagon and other branches of the military, is responsible for establishing and approving military strategy. They must evaluate current threats and assign resources to address those threats, both domestically and internationally. - Deployment of Military Forces: The President has the authority to deploy U.S. troops and order military actions as part of their role as Commander-in-Chief. This can include the use of force to protect the nation's interests, responding to international crises, or intervening in other countries' conflicts. - Authorization of Military Budget: While Congress ultimately approves the military budget, the President has significant input in the process. The President and their administration establish goals and priorities for the military and work with Congress to secure funding to support those objectives. - Appointment of Military Leaders: The President nominates top military personnel, such as the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Secretary of Defense. These positions play a pivotal role in shaping military policy and managing military operations. - Nuclear Weapons: One of the most profound responsibilities of the President is their authority to order the use of nuclear weapons. The President has sole authority to launch a nuclear strike after consulting with advisors. 2. Control over economic growth during a President's term: The President has several tools at their disposal to influence economic growth. While they don't have direct control over all aspects of the economy, their decisions and policies can have a substantial impact. Some ways in which a President can influence economic growth include: - Fiscal Policy: The President proposes an annual budget to Congress, which outlines the administration's priorities and plans to fund federal programs and services. This budget can have a significant impact on economic growth by determining the level of government spending and investment in various sectors, such as infrastructure, education, and research and development. - Monetary Policy: While the President does not directly set monetary policy, they do appoint the members of the Federal Reserve Board, including the Chair. The Federal Reserve conducts monetary policy through interest rate adjustments and other measures, which ultimately influence the overall economy. - Tax Policy: The President can propose changes to the tax code, which can foster or hinder economic growth. Tax incentives and reductions can stimulate growth by encouraging investment and consumer spending, while increases in taxes may have the opposite effect. - Regulatory Policy: The President shapes regulatory policy through the executive branch, impacting various industries and sectors of the economy. Easing or tightening regulations can have implications for businesses, job creation, and overall economic growth. - Trade Policy: The President plays a prominent role in guiding trade policy. Through negotiations and agreements, they can open markets for U.S. goods, protect domestic industries, or create new trade opportunities. Trade policies can significantly influence economic growth through export and import levels, job creation, and overall competitiveness. In conclusion, the President of the United States holds considerable power over both military affairs and economic growth during their term. They can shape and implement policies in these areas, although their decisions are subject to various checks and balances. These two questions are not paraphrases of each other, as each focuses on distinct areas of the President's influence and responsibilities."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It was not entirely true that Patch knew there was food in the mountains. He had never been to the mountains. No squirrel in all the Center Kingdom, as far as he knew, had ever been to the mountains. For between the kingdom and the mountains, surrounding it on all sides like a moat around a castle, there lay a blasted concrete wasteland, as wide as fifty squirrels laid nose to tail, and horrific death machines roared up and down this wasteland at terrifying speeds, all day and night. What's more, humans and dogs often crossed between the mountains and the kingdoms. And sometimes the dogs were not leashed. A squirrel would have to be very desperate indeed to dare the wastelands. It was Toro who had told Patch about the food in the mountains. Toro was Patch's friend. And that itself was extraordinary. Patch had always talked to birds. The drey he had grown up in -- Silver's old drey, before she became leader of the Seeker clan -- had been only a few branches away from a nest of robins. Once, in early spring when he was still a baby, Patch had crawled out of Silver's drey and into the robin's nest, and had spent a whole day among the chicks before Silver returned home and retrieved him. The robin mother had been unamused by Silver's profound apologies, and even less amused when Patch had returned to her nest the very next day. Eventually Silver taught Patch to leave the robins alone, but not before he had learned how to speak Bird. Most squirrels of the Center Kingdom could say and understand a few simple things in Bird, but Patch could actually hold conversations. And so, one autumn day when a bluejay swooped past and stole an acorn out of Patch's paws, Patch shouted angrily at the thief in Bird to bring it back; and the thief, intrigued, wheeled around in midair, perched on a branch above Patch, and looked curiously down at the irate squirrel. \\"Thieving feather-brained no-nose hawkbait!\\" Patch shouted up. \\"Stupid blind furry groundworm!\\" the bluejay retorted, and began to peck at the acorn.

Review: I first saw Jake Gyllenhaal in Jarhead (2005) a little while back and, since then, I've been watching every one of his movies that arrives on my radar screen. Like Clive Owen, he has an intensity (and he even resembles Owen somewhat) that just oozes from the screen. I feel sure that, if he lands some meaty roles, he'll crack an Oscar one day... That's not to denigrate this film at all. It's a fine story, with very believable people (well, it's based upon the author's early shenanigans with rocketry), a great cast  Chris Cooper is always good, and Laura Dern is always on my watch list  with the appropriate mix of humor, pathos, excitement...and the great sound track with so many rock n roll oldies to get the feet tapping. But, this film had a very special significance for me: in 1957, I was the same age as Homer Hickham; like him, I looked up at the night stars to watch Sputnik as it scudded across the blackness; like Homer also, I experimented with rocketry in my backyard and used even the exact same chemicals for fuel; and like Homer, I also had most of my attempts end in explosive disaster! What fun it was... I didn't achieve his great (metaphorical and physical) heights though. But, that's what you find out when you see this movie. Sure, it's a basic family movie, but that's a dying breed these days, it seems. Take the time to see it, with the kids: you'll all have a lot of good laughs. What is the sentiment of this review? Options: (a). negative (b). positive","output":"The sentiment of this review is (b). positive. From a thematic and stylistic point of view, the reviewer shares a positive sentiment towards the film and the actors in it, particularly Jake Gyllenhaal, Chris Cooper, and Laura Dern. They praise Gyllenhaal's intensity and predict his future Oscar potential, while appreciating Laura Dern and Chris Cooper's performances. They also commend the story, the believable characters and the soundtrack, suggesting an overall positive impression of the film.  Furthermore, the reviewer reveals a close personal connection to the film, comparing their own childhood experiences with the protagonist's story, which adds another layer to their positive sentiment. The reviewer highlights the fun they had experimenting with rocketry in their backyard and watching Sputnik, just like the protagonist.  Even though the film is described as a \\"basic family movie\\", the reviewer frames this in a positive context, arguing that this is a \\"dying breed these days\\" and recommending the film for viewing with children for a good laugh, which reinforces the overall positive sentiment.

Since the Industrial Revolution anthropogenic emissions – primarily from use of fossil fuels and deforestation – have rapidly increased its concentration in the atmosphere, leading to global warming.  Carbon dioxide also causes ocean acidification because it dissolves in water to form carbonic acid.  and the situation: China used alternative fuels to generate electricity, while Mongolia burned lots of fossil fuels.

The information provided primarily discusses carbon dioxide emissions and the use of fossil fuels and alternative fuels in electricity generation. To determine which country contributed more to deforestation, additional information about each country's land-use practices, such as logging, agriculture, and land clearing for urban or industrial development, would be necessary.

In June 1999, Gaddafi visited Mandela in South Africa, and the following month attended the OAU summit in Algiers, calling for greater political and economic integration across the continent and advocating the foundation of a United States of Africa. He became one of the founders of the African Union (AU), initiated in July 2002 to replace the OAU; at the opening ceremonies, he proclaimed that African states should reject conditional aid from the developed world, a direct contrast to the message of South African President Thabo Mbeki. At the third AU summit, held in Libya in July 2005, he called for a greater level of integration, advocating a single AU passport, a common defence system and a single currency, utilising the slogan: \\"The United States of Africa is the hope.\\" In June 2005, Libya joined the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA), and in August 2008 Gaddafi was proclaimed \\"King of Kings\\" by an assembled committee of traditional African leaders. On 1 February 2009, his \\"coronation ceremony\\" was held in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, coinciding with Gaddafi's election as AU chairman for a year.

Crusaders, Mamelukes, and Turks: The Crusaders established a feudal Christian state with Godfrey at its head. They built many impressive churches during the term of the first Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem, but in 1187 they were driven out by Muslim forces under the great warrior Saladin. During the Sixth Crusade (1228– 1229), the Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II managed to secure Jerusalem for the Christians by negotiation. The Christians, however, could not hold the city. After they lost Jerusalem, a Mongol invasion swept through, and in 1244 the Mameluke dynasty of Egypt took control, ruling Jerusalem for the next 250 years. The city struggled to rebuild from Crusader wars and invasions. Much of the best Islamic architecture in the city was constructed in the Mameluke era, but the past thousand years had taken their toll: Jerusalem was unable to regain the prosperity it had enjoyed in earlier times. In the early 16th century, the Ottoman Turkish Empire was advancing through the Middle East. Jerusalem fell to the Ottomans in 1517, remaining under their control for 400 years. Suleiman the Magnificent rebuilt the walls and gates in the form they retain to this day. Fountains, inns, religious schools, and barracks were constructed. But when Suleiman died, his empire, including Jerusalem, began a long period of decline. The Holy City remained a backwater until the 19th century, when renewed interest among Christian pilgrims made it the destination of thousands of travelers each year.

SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear agreement is not expected to derail diplomatic momentum to reach a deal to end North Korea’s nuclear weapons program, but it could complicate the negotiation process, analysts say. Trump on Tuesday announced that the United States is ending its participation in the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) that lifted sanctions on Iran in exchange for Tehran limiting its nuclear program, and would re-impose U.S. economic sanctions on Iran. The agreement was negotiated by the administration of Trump’s predecessor, President Barack Obama, and involved five other world powers; Great Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia. Trump’s National Security Adviser John Bolton said the U.S. decision to re-impose sanctions on Iran will set a higher standard for North Korea nuclear talks by sending, “a very clear signal that the United States will not accept inadequate deals.” The U.S. policy reversal on Iran should not seriously impede diplomatic progress underway with North Korea, said Victor Cha, a noted Korea scholar with the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “In terms of how the North Koreans would take it, I don’t think they’d take it one way or the other. I don’t think they’d see it as negative or positive because they think they’re different from anybody else anyway. They think they’re a very special case,” Cha said at a CSIS conference this week. While the Iran deal limited that country’s efforts to develop a nuclear bomb, North Korea already possesses 20 to 60 nuclear warheads, according assessments by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency, and between 40 to 100 nuclear development facilities, according a report from the RAND Corporation security research organization. But apprehension over whether future U.S. presidents would uphold a nuclear deal reached by Trump could reinforce the North Korean demand for early concessions. John Delury, a North...

Answer the following question: This is a correct answer to the following question about Fiona. Yes or no? Answer: The name Fiona is rising in popularity particularly in German -speaking countries. Question: what is the origin of fiona Answer:","output":"The origin of the name Fiona can be traced back to the Gaelic tradition and holds significant roots in the Irish, Scottish, and other Celtic cultures. The name is derived from the Gaelic word \\"fionn\\", which means \\"fair, pale, or white\\". Fiona is an apt choice to denote someone with fair features or light complexions, symbolizing a beautiful countenance in the speaker's mind. The name Fiona began to gain popularity in the 20th century primarily due to the works of Scottish author James Macpherson. In his series of poems published during the 1760s, Macpherson introduced a character named Fíona, who was the heroine in his Ossianic Cycle, drawing inspiration from Celtic mythology and the story of Fionn Mac Cumhaill, a legendary Irish hero. Macpherson's works sparked great interest, both artistically and academically, in Celtic cultures and managed to propel the name Fiona to new heights of popularity. By the 20th century, Fiona had become a popular choice for girls' names in the British Isles. However, the name did not emerge as a popular option in the United States until several decades later, around the 1990s. Since then, the name has been consistently popular, particularly in English-speaking countries, as well as in Northern Europe, especially in Germany, where it has seen a significant rise in recent years. The name Fiona has managed to maintain its allure and charm across generations, primarily due to its links to Celtic folklore and its soft, melodic sound. Today, it remains a popular choice for parents who are drawn to names that embody both grace and strength, as well as those who have an affinity for traditional or historical monikers. In conclusion, the origin of the name Fiona comes from the ancient Gaelic and Celtic cultures, derived from a word meaning \\"fair\\" or \\"white\\". The name's popularity began with the works of Scottish author James Macpherson, showcasing a beautiful character in his Ossianic Cycle, and has since been a popular choice for girls' names, especially in English-speaking countries and Northern Europe. Today, the name carries connotations of grace, strength, and historical roots that continue to appeal to parents around the world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Select from the following. [1]. yes; [2]. it is not possible to tell; [3]. no;","output":"The premise given states that the Stop & Shop was sold to a Dutch company for a profit of 1. Given this, there is a clear implication that there has been a profit involved in the transaction. The hypothesis \\"There is a profit of 1.00\\" is directly supported by the information provided in the premise. To understand this better, let's break down the provided statement. The Stop & Shop was sold for some unidentified price, but after deducting the costs involved in the transaction (possibly the buying price and other expenses like operational costs, marketing costs etc.) the leftover amount (or surplus value) was 1. This surplus is referred to as profit. Since the premise clearly states that a profit of 1 was made, it is safe to say that something was gained from this transaction, even if it was only a single dollar. The word \\"profit\\" signifies a financial gain, especially the difference between the amount earned from selling something and the amount spent in buying, operating, or producing it. In this context, the profit made was 1 which clearly aligns with the hypothesis \\"There is a profit of 1.00\\". Therefore, if we had to choose an answer from the provided options, the correct answer would be: [1].

Here is a question about this article: Czech has one of the most phonemic orthographies of all European languages. Its thirty-one graphemes represent thirty sounds (in most dialects, i and y have the same sound), and it contains only one digraph: ch, which follows h in the alphabet. As a result, some of its characters have been used by phonologists to denote corresponding sounds in other languages. The characters q, w and x appear only in foreign words. The háček (ˇ) is used with certain letters to form new characters: š, ž, and č, as well as ň, ě, ř, ť, and ď (the latter five uncommon outside Czech). The last two letters are sometimes written with a comma above (ʼ, an abbreviated háček) because of their height. The character ó exists only in loanwords and onomatopoeia.

Breathing is the process of moving air into and out of the lungs. The process depends on a muscle called the diaphragm. This is a large, sheet-like muscle below the lungs. Inhaling, or breathing in, occurs when the diaphragm muscle tightens. This increases the size of the chest. This too decreases air pressure inside the lungs. This action allows air and gases to enter the lungs. Exhaling, or breathing out, occurs when the diaphragm muscle relaxes. This decreases the size of the chest. This increases air pressure inside the lungs. This action allows for air to leave the lungs. When you inhale, air enters the respiratory system through your nose and ends up in your lungs, where gas exchange with the blood takes place. What happens to the air along the way? In the nose, mucus and hairs trap any dust or other particles in the air. The air is also warmed and moistened. Next, air passes through a passageway that is connected to the windpipe. The air then finds its way to the lungs. In the chest, the windpipe splits so that air enters both the right and left lung.

Write an article using the following points: Captive journalist John Cantlie calls video the \\"last in this series\\" Cantlie has appeared in previous ISIS videos. Article:","output":"Title: Captive Journalist John Cantlie Appears in Alleged Final ISIS Video Introduction: British journalist John Cantlie, who has been held captive by ISIS since 2012, recently appeared in a video he called the \\"last in this series.\\" Cantlie has been featured in numerous propaganda videos by the terrorist group over the past six years. Step 1: Mention John Cantlie's background and the context of his capture John Cantlie, a talented and experienced British war reporter, was initially kidnapped alongside American journalist James Foley in November 2012 while covering the conflict in Syria. While Foley was tragically executed by ISIS in August 2014, Cantlie has remained a captive and unwilling participant in the group's propaganda efforts. Step 2: Describe Cantlie's role in previous ISIS videos Throughout the years, ISIS has exploited Cantlie's journalistic background to front various documentary-style videos, including a series titled \\"Lend Me Your Ears.\\" In these videos, Cantlie has delivered scripted messages critical of Western governments and policies, undoubtedly under duress.  Step 3: Relate the significance of the \\"last in this series\\" message The recent video, in which Cantlie claims it to be the \\"last in this series,\\" has sparked concerns both for his safety and the potential cessation of the propaganda campaign that has kept him alive. This change in tone and the uncertainty that follows raises alarm among those who have followed his plight. Step 4: Explain the implications of Cantlie's appearance in the new video The fact that Cantlie has appeared in this new video suggests that he is still alive, albeit under the control of ISIS. The video's timing also confirms that the extremist group continues to use media as a tool for manipulation and fear-mongering, despite their diminishing territorial control. Step 5: Offer hope for Cantlie's release The ongoing efforts to liberate territory from ISIS control may increase the chances of locating and rescuing remaining captives, such as John Cantlie. International authorities and humanitarian organizations are closely monitoring the situation, with the hope that the end of Cantlie's forced involvement in ISIS propaganda campaigns could signal his eventual freedom and an end to his long ordeal. Conclusion: As the world anxiously anticipates what the future holds for captive journalist John Cantlie, the implications of his alleged final appearance in an ISIS video remain unknown. As ISIS continues to lose ground, authorities and organizations will work to secure the safe release of Cantlie and other captives, ending a terrifying chapter in their lives and bringing closure to their families and friends who have relentlessly hoped for their safe return."},{"instruction":"Fact 1: Cutting down trees has a negative impact on an ecosystem.

The 13th century building is now being sold by the Diocese of Salisbury. But the buyer will not own the graveyard which remains open to mourners. Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Title: A New Era for St. Paul's Church in Staverton: A Priceless Gem Awaits a New Guardian The centuries-old St. Paul's Church in Staverton, Wiltshire, has had a rich and storied history, having stood proudly since the 13th century. Serving as a beacon of faith, solace, and contemplation for the local community, it has been an indispensable spiritual anchor for countless generations. However, recent years have seen the majestic structure face some new challenges. Attendance to the church has shrunk considerably, forcing the decision to close its doors. As the number of parishioners attending St. Paul's Church continued to fall, it became increasingly evident that the building required a new lease on life. Consequently, the Diocese of Salisbury made the difficult decision to put the historic church up for sale, commencing a new chapter in the life of the cherished structure. Despite this challenging turn of events, the graveyard surrounding St. Paul's will continue to serve the public. It remains accessible to mourners and visitors, offering a haven of peace and tranquility to those who wish to pay their respects. While the buyer will not own the graveyard, they will have the rare opportunity to safeguard and cherish a piece of architectural heritage. This elegant 13th-century structure is a testament to the craftsmanship and engineering skills of a bygone age. It stands proud, with its robust stone walls, soaring arches and elaborate stained glass windows. The distinctive bell tower graces the skyline, serving as a reminder of the rich cultural past that permeates the sleepy village. Being entrusted with such a landmark presents a unique opportunity for an individual or organization to renovate, restore, and breathe new life into it. The new custodians will have the chance to adapt this stunning building for a variety of purposes while preserving its essence and respecting its spiritual roots. Notably, the sale of St. Paul's Church is not an isolated incident. A recent survey conducted by the National Churches Trust found that almost half of all adults in the United Kingdom have not attended a place of worship in the last year. This shift in attendance patterns has put numerous historical churches at risk, both in terms of maintenance as well as the continuity of their religious and community functions. For many, the thought of losing these architectural gems is unbearable, as they are symbols of our cultural heritage and an integral part of the British landscape. As a society, it is imperative that we find creative solutions for the reuse and maintenance of these structures. Initiatives like the Historic Religious Buildings Alliance work tirelessly to ensure a sustainable future for these distinctive edifices while championing adaptive re-use and development projects. As St. Paul's Church in Staverton awaits its new owner, one can't help but hope that the building will continue to flourish as part of the living fabric of the village, serving new purposes and meeting the evolving needs of its inhabitants. The sale of this landmark offers much more than a commercial transaction; it represents a rare opportunity to preserve history, restore a priceless gem, and make a tangible, lasting impact on a community that has treasured it for centuries."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","output":"The domed stadium that hosted the Basketbowl, also known as Ford Field, is owned and operated by the Detroit-Wayne County Stadium Authority. Ford Field, located in Detroit, Michigan, was the venue for the Basketbowl on December 13, 2003. This unique event was a college basketball game between the University of Michigan Wolverines and the University of Kentucky Wildcats. The game attracted a record-breaking crowd, with 78,129 people in attendance, setting the world record for the largest audience at a basketball game at the time. Ford Field, which opened in August 2002, encompasses 1.85 million square feet and has a seating capacity of 65,000, which can be expanded to accommodate larger events such as concerts, conventions, and other specialty events like the Basketbowl. The stadium is also well-known as the home of the National Football League's (NFL) Detroit Lions. The Detroit-Wayne County Stadium Authority is a public entity created in 1970 to finance and oversee the construction, operation, and maintenance of the professional sports stadiums owned by Wayne County in the Detroit metropolitan area, including Ford Field. The Authority is governed by a seven-member board, with representatives appointed by the Wayne County Executive, the Mayor of Detroit, and the Governor of Michigan. The Ford Motor Company, an American multinational automaker headquartered in Dearborn, Michigan, secured naming rights to the stadium in November 2000 for a 20-year term at a cost of 40 million. As the sponsor, the automaker has the right to have its name and logo prominently featured at the stadium, which helps create a strong association for their brand with sports and entertainment activities held at Ford Field. In conclusion, Ford Field, the domed stadium that hosted the Basketbowl event, is owned and operated by the Detroit-Wayne County Stadium Authority, a public entity established to oversee the stadiums in the Detroit metropolitan area. The naming rights were secured by the Ford Motor Company, but the ownership remains with the Authority, making it the responsible party for the operations and maintenance of the venue."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Indian protesters attack Domino’s near Mumbai after diplomat’s arrest, strip search Protesters furious at the arrest and strip search of an Indian diplomat in Manhattan last week attacked a Domino's Pizza store near Mumbai on Friday, demanding a ban on American goods and threatening to escalate what is already a diplomatic crisis. No one was hurt in the ransacking of the eatery in a suburb of the western Indian city, authorities said. Mumbai, also known as Bombay, is the diplomat's hometown. Police said they were stepping up patrols of major U.S. outlets, including McDonald's, in the wake of the attack, in which protesters shattered the pizza store's glass door. Earlier this week, protesters burned photos of President Obama and wore saris made from the American flag. Deputy Consul Devyani Khobragade, busted on charges that she lied to the United States on a visa application for her maid and then paid the maid just 3.31 an hour, has become a heroine to many Indians, with at least one political party urging her to run for parliament. \\"Whatever happened with her is condemnable,\\" said Azam Khan, a Samajwadi Party leader. \\"If she returns to India, we are ready to give her a ticket for the 2014 polls.\\" Experts said Indian politicians looking ahead to elections in 2014 are fanning the flames of outrage in the Khobragade incident order to score political points with patriotic voters. RELATED: INDIA DEMANDS U.S. DROP PROSECUTION OF DIPLOMAT Indian authorities have taken several retaliatory steps against American diplomats, even removing concrete barricades from the front of the U.S. embassy in New Delhi that protect against attacks. The U.S. State Department has tried to smooth things over this week, with Secretary of State John Kerry and other officials making phone calls to Indian authorities. But the Indian government remains angry, and the State Department won't ask Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara to drop the charges against Khobragade. Many Indians are incensed at the idea that Khobragade, a woman and a senior diplomat, would be subjected to a strip search. But American officials said the practice is routine. Bharara, who is Indian-American, has taken a defiant stand in the case, stating that U.S. authorities treated Khobragade with respect. The prosecutor ripped his critics Wednesday night for sympathizing with the diplomat rather than her maid, Sangeeta Richard. Khobragade and Indian officials have accused Richard of trying to use the wage allegations to blackmail her employer for money and immigration papers. RELATED: INDIA FREEZES DUTY FREE IMPORT OF BOOZE FOR AMERICANS They say Richard stole items from Khobragade's home and ran away in June, and they contend the diplomat paid the maid exactly what she told the U.S. she would. Khobragade said that she wired a portion of Richard's salary directly to Richard's husband in India and that Richard received the rest in cash in New York. The diplomat's sister, Sharmistha, took to Facebook on Thursday to defend her sibling and to post a letter purportedly written by the maid, media reports said. The sister said that Richard was treated well, with two rooms to herself, a private entrance, the freedom to come and go as she pleased, a cellphone and an iPad. The letter that Richard ostensibly wrote home to India shortly after reaching the U.S. last November is upbeat, reports said. \\"I'm not feeling I'm her servant,\\" it supposedly reads in Hindi. \\"Madam is very nice. Every day she has a smile.\\" RELATED: INDIA RETALIATES AFTER DIPLOMAT'S 'BARBARIC' NYC ARREST It was unclear how Khobragade's sister obtained the letter that she says Richard wrote. In a release Thursday, Richard's American lawyer denied the blackmail allegations. \\"There was no extortion or anything along those lines. She essentially worked within the home and attempted to ask for more time off, ask for more reasonable hours, but those attempts to resolve the issues were unsuccessful,\\" Dana Sussman said. India has transferred Khobragade to its permanent mission to the United Nations in order to net her full diplomatic immunity, which her lawyer believes is retroactive. The U.S. contests that claim. Meanwhile, there were more than 20 protesters at the Consulate General of India in New York to support Richard.","output":"Protesters in India attacked a Domino's Pizza store near Mumbai, fueled by anger at the arrest and strip search of Indian diplomat Devyani Khobragade in Manhattan.

Victim: Nijole Siskeviciene was strangled in October 1998 near her home in Wembley, north London. James Kennedy, 54, denies murder. A convicted rapist strangled a woman to death but was not arrested for 12 years after sending police anonymous letters blaming two black men for the crime, a court heard. James Kennedy, 54, was charged with murder after he was stopped for drink-driving in July 2010 and  police took a DNA sample from him. It matched saliva found on Nijole Siskeviciene, 44, whose body was discovered beside a garage in Wembley, north London, in October 1998, the Old Bailey was told yesterday. She had been sexually assaulted and strangled with a ligature, prosecutor Philip Bennetts QC said. Kennedy lived two doors away from the mother-of-one at the time and denied knowing her when interviewed by police in house-to-house inquiries. A week after the murder police received two anonymous letters from someone claiming to have seen two black men carrying out a girl from a house. When he was arrested at his home in Weston-Super-Mare in January this year, Kennedy - who now walks with a stick - said 'Oh my God' and was 'visibly shaken', the court heard. His DNA was found to match that on the letters and police found the same stationery in his home during a search, the hearing was told. Mr Bennetts said Nijole 'had marks to her body consistent. with having been held by her attacker about the throat and wrists and. injuries were consistent with a hand being placed over her mouth. Her underwear was inside out. 'Together with evidence of DNA upon her body and clothing, that evidence. is clear, say the prosecution, and consistent with there having been. sexual activity prior to, or at the time of her death.' The court heard that Kennedy was previously jailed for raping two women in his home town in Ireland in 1978. Then aged 21, he offered a 19-year-old a lift in his car and raped her and tightened a ligature around her neck until she passed out. He then threw her into a lake and when she tried to reach the shore threw rocks at her. His 23-year-old second victim was attacked a month later, and was raped while Kennedy held his hands around her throat. He pleaded guilty to the two rapes in 1979 and was jailed, the jury was told. Kennedy, who changed his name to Citro in 2003, denies murder but admits perverting the course of justice by sending the two letters to police. Mr Bennetts told the court: 'The prosecution case is based upon circumstantial evidence - DNA, differing accounts given by James Citro and letters written by him to divert attention from him. 'Why else would he write the letters?' The trial continues. What are the important parts of this article?","output":"1.

I tell her my family has decided to shut the air conditioner off and reduce our electric bill. On this first night of our cost-cutting plan, it's only 85 degrees. We're going to suffer, but the three kids complain anyway. They have grown up in 72-degree comfort, protected from the world outside. \\"It's too hot to sleep,\\" my 13-year-old daughter complains. \\"I'm about to die from this heat,\\" her brother complains down the hall. \\"Just try it tonight,\\" I tell them. In truth I'm too tired to turn for long. My face is sweaty, but I lie quietly listening to the cricket choirs outside that remind me of childhood. The neighbor's dog howls. Probably a passing squirrel. It's been years since I took the time to really listen to the night. I think about grandma, who lived to 92 and still helped with my mom's gardening until just a few weeks before she died. And then, I'm back there at her house in the summer heat of my childhood. I move my pillow to the foot of grandma's bed and turn my face toward the open window. I turn the pillow, hunting for the cooler side. Grandma saw me turn over and over. \\"If you just watch for the breeze ,\\" she said, \\"you'll cool off and fall asleep.\\" I stare at the filmy white curtain, willing it to move. Lying still, waiting, I suddenly notice the life outside the window. The bug chorus. Neighbors, porch -sitting late, speak in unclear words that calm me. \\"Mom, did you hear that?\\" my seven-year-old son cries, \\"I think it was an owl family.\\" \\"Probably,\\" I tell him, \\"just keep listening...\\" Without the working air conditioner, the house is peaceful, and the natural night noises seem close enough to touch.

Despite the children's complaints, the author explores the serenity and connections that come from this naturalistic auditory experience, evoking memories of their grandmother and the wisdom she imparted about enduring the heat. \\"Waiting for the Breeze\\" not only captures the physical action that the family is doing, but it also encapsulates the emotional undertones of the story. It refers to the advice the narrator received from her grandmother about enduring the heat by seeking and waiting for a breeze, a metaphor that resonates throughout the passage. The other options \\"B: An Interesting Experience\\", \\"C: Life at Present and Life in the Past\\", and \\"D: Different Times, Different Children\\" all hold some relevance to the content of the article. However, none of these titles truly capture the transformative experience that the author outlines, which involves waiting for the breeze, listening to the sounds of nature, and finding comfort in the deeper connections being formed with the world outside.

It encases a worldview, a sense of longing, and the realization that comfort can sometimes be found in the most unconventional places, just by waiting for the breeze to come in.

Jimbob's folks never gave a second thought that their boy might be different. The first Spring he walked, he stomped the moors in his welly-boots helping herd the pregnant ewes down in-by. He copied his father, kicking and cuffing at the stragglers, when the flock was returned to the hills in May. As Jimbob grew, his hair became thicker, his arms longer. His head shrunk down on his shoulders. At check-ups, nurses fixed smiles and pronounced him healthy. Doctors said, 'he'll make you a strapping lad.' His mother smiled, her heart swelled. When he was three, she sent him to nursery. She wanted him to mix with other kids. To taste life off the hard hills. She said, 'it'll do him the world of good.' Jimbob hated leaving the farm. He clung to his mother. She drove away, blinking tears. On the third day, she took a phone call. 'It's Jimbob,' they said. 'He's scaring the other kids.'The truth hit Jimbob's mother like a hammer.

This is a very busy city with lots of cars and people always in a hurry to get to different places. One of the motorcyclists got into some trouble with a man driving a big car called an SUV. When people get angry, sometimes they don't think before they act, and they can make bad choices. The motorcyclist did something that made the man in the big car very upset. They started to yell at each other and got even more angry. Suddenly, they both acted without thinking and made some bad decisions. The motorcyclist got really mad and did something to the man's SUV that left another motorcycle rider hurt and needing to go to the hospital. Hospitals are places where doctors and nurses help people feel better when they are hurt or sick. The hurt motorcycle rider was taken to the hospital so the doctors and nurses could help him get better. But, the story doesn't end there. The man in the big car was also very upset, and he got out of his car to yell some more at the motorcyclists. This was not a good idea, because when people are angry, they sometimes don't know how to talk nicely to each other. Some of the other motorcycle riders saw the man yelling at their friend, and they decided to join in. They were angry too, and started to fight with the man from the SUV, which led to him getting hurt. After the fight, the motorcyclists left and the hurt man had to find help so he could feel better. Now, many people have heard what happened and the police have gotten involved. The police are people whose job is to keep everyone safe and make sure people follow the rules. They heard what happened on the road between the motorcyclists and the man in the big car and decided that it wasn't right. So they started looking for the person who started all the trouble. The police found one of the motorcyclists who was part of the angry group. Police decided to arrest him because he did not follow the rules and hurt other people. Arresting is when the police take someone to a place called jail, where they have to stay until they can fix the problems they caused. In the end, many people learned a very important lesson: when we get angry, it's important to remember to be kind to others and think before we act. That way, we can avoid getting into big trouble and make sure everyone stays safe and happy."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Information:  - The British Empire comprised the dominions, colonies, protectorates, mandates and other territories ruled or administered by the United Kingdom and its predecessor states. It originated with the overseas possessions and trading posts established by England between the late 16th and early 18th centuries. At its height, it was the largest empire in history and, for over a century, was the foremost global power. By 1913, the British Empire held sway over 412 million people, % of the world population at the time, and by 1920, it covered , % of the Earth's total land area. As a result, its political, legal, linguistic and cultural legacy is widespread. At the peak of its power, the phrase \\"the empire on which the sun never sets\\" was often used to describe the British Empire, because its expanse around the globe meant that the sun was always shining on at least one of its territories.  - English America, and later British America, were the English, and later British, territories in North America (including Bermuda), Central America, the Caribbean, and Guyana from 1607 to 1783. Formally, the British colonies in North America were known as \\"British America and the British West Indies\\" until 1776, when the Thirteen British Colonies located along the Atlantic seaboard declared their independence and formed the United States of America. After that, British North America (or, simply but not inclusively, Canada) was used to describe the remainder of Britain's continental North American possessions. The term \\"British North America\\" was first used informally in 1783, but it was uncommon before the Report on the Affairs of British North America (1839), called the Durham Report.  - The American Revolution was a political upheaval that took place between 1765 and 1783 during which colonists in the Thirteen American Colonies rejected the British monarchy and aristocracy, overthrew the authority of Great Britain, and founded the United States of America.  - Canada (French: ) is a country in the northern half of North America. Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean, covering , making it the world's second-largest country by total area and the fourth-largest country by land area. Canada's border with the United States is the world's longest land border. The majority of the country has a cold or severely cold winter climate, but southerly areas are warm in summer. Canada is sparsely populated, the majority of its land territory being dominated by forest and tundra and the Rocky Mountains. About four-fifths of the country's population of 36 million people is urbanized and live near the southern border. Its capital is Ottawa, its largest city is Toronto; other major urban areas include Montreal, Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Quebec City, Winnipeg and Hamilton.  - A Tory holds a political philosophy (Toryism) based on a British version of traditionalism and conservatism, which upholds the supremacy of social order as it has evolved throughout history. The Tory ethos has been summed up with the phrase \\"God, King and Country\\". Tories generally advocate monarchism, are usually of a high church Anglican religious heritage, and are opposed to the liberalism of the Whig faction. In Britain, the Tory political faction originated with the Cavaliers during the English Civil War. This political philosophy remains prominent in the politics of the United Kingdom, and also appears in parts of the Commonwealth realms, particularly in Canada. It also had exponents in other parts of the former British Empire, such as the Loyalists of British America who opposed American secession during the American Revolutionary War. Under the Corn Laws (18151846) a majority of Tories supported protectionist agrarianism with tariffs being imposed at the time for higher food prices, self-sufficiency, and enhanced wages in rural employment.  - The United Kingdom is a unitary state with devolution governed within the framework of a parliamentary democracy under a constitutional monarchy, in which the monarch, currently Queen Elizabeth II, is the head of state and the prime minister of the United Kingdom, currently Theresa May, is the head of government. Executive power is exercised by the British government, on behalf of and by the consent of the monarch, as well as by the devolved governments of Scotland and Wales, and the Northern Ireland Executive. Legislative power is vested in the two chambers of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, the House of Commons and the House of Lords, as well as in the Scottish parliament and Welsh and Northern Ireland assemblies. The judiciary is independent of the executive and the legislature. The highest court is the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom.  - Cavalier first used by Roundheads as a term of abuse for the wealthier male Royalist supporters of King Charles I and his son Charles II of England during the English Civil War, the Interregnum, and the Restoration (1642  c. 1679). It was later adopted by the Royalists themselves. Although it referred originally to political and social attitudes and behaviour, of which clothing was a very small part, it has subsequently become strongly identified with the fashionable clothing of the court at the time. Prince Rupert, commander of much of Charles I's cavalry, is often considered to be an archetypal Cavalier.  - The Corn Laws were measures enforced in the United Kingdom between 1815 and 1846, which imposed restrictions and tariffs on imported grain. They were designed to keep grain prices high to favour domestic producers. The laws did indeed raise food prices and became the focus of opposition from urban groups who had far less political power than rural Britain. The Corn Laws imposed steep import duties, making it too expensive to import grain from abroad, even when food supplies were short. The laws were supported by Conservative landowners and opposed by Whig industrialists and workers. The Anti-Corn Law League was responsible for turning public and elite opinion against the laws, in a large, nationwide middle-class moral crusade with a Utopian vision.  - A Commonwealth realm is a sovereign state that is a member of the Commonwealth of Nations and shares the same person, currently Elizabeth II, as its head of state and reigning constitutional monarch, but retains a crown legally distinct from the other realms. As of 2017, there are 16 Commonwealth realms: Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Jamaica, Antigua and Barbuda, Belize, Papua New Guinea, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Tuvalu, Barbados, Grenada, Solomon Islands, Saint Lucia, The Bahamas, and the United Kingdom.   - The American Revolutionary War (17751783), also referred to as the American War of Independence and the Revolutionary War in the United States, was an armed conflict between Great Britain and thirteen of its North American colonies that after onset of the war declared independence as the United States of America.  - William Gordon , 2nd Earl of Aberdeen ( 1679 -- 30 March 1746 ) , known between c. 1691 and 1720 as Lord Haddo , was a Scottish peer , Tory politician and Jacobite .

His father was a television repairman and a United States Marine Corps veteran of World War II and the Korean War. His mother worked at a record store. Danzig and his family also spent some time living in Revere, Massachusetts. In the mid-1970s, Danzig started the Misfits, releasing the band's records through his own label, (originally known as Blank, then later as Plan 9). Danzig had attempted to get the Misfits signed to several record labels, only to be told that he would never have a career in music. The impetus for the band's name comes from Marilyn Monroe's last film, combined with Danzig considering himself to be a \\"social misfit.\\" In October 1983, after releasing several singles and three albums, and gaining a small underground following, Danzig disbanded the Misfits due to increasing animosity among the band members and his dissatisfaction with their musical abilities. Danzig explained his decision: \\"It was difficult for me to work with those guys, because they weren't prepared to put in the hours practicing. I wanted to move things forward, and they didn't seem to have the same outlook. So it was time for me to move on.\\"  After the Misfits, he began work on a new band project: Samhain. The origins of Samhain began when Danzig started rehearsing with Eerie Von, formerly of Rosemary's Babies. Danzig took the name of the band from the ancient Celtic New Year, which influenced the evolution of the modern Halloween. Initially Samhain was conceived as a punk rock \\"super group\\". The band briefly featured members of Minor Threat and Reagan Youth, who contributed to Samhain's 1984 debut, Initium. The band then settled with a lineup consisting of Eerie Von on bass, Damien on guitar, and Steve Zing on drums (later replaced by London May). In 1985 the Unholy Passion EP was released, followed by November-Coming-Fire in 1986.  Samhain eventually began to attract the interest of major labels including Epic and Elektra. Rick Rubin, music producer and head of the Def American label, would see the band perform at the 1986 New Music Seminar, on the advice of then-Metallica bassist Cliff Burton. Danzig has credited both Burton and Metallica frontman James Hetfield with helping to raise awareness about his music: \\"I first met them at a Black Flag gig, and then we became kinda friends. We'd often bump into each other on the road...James and Cliff helped to spread the word about me, and I was very grateful to them.\\" Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: Did they change the name from misfits to Samhain?","output":"No, the article does not mention a direct name change from Misfits to Samhain.

Given the question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: We've reached a strange--some would say unusual--point. While fighting world hunger continues to be the matter of vital importance according to a recent report from the World Health Organization (WHO), more people now die from being overweight, or say, from being extremely fat, than from being underweight. It's the good life that's more likely to kill us these days. Worse, nearly l8 million children under the age of five around the world are estimated to be overweight. What's going on? We really don't have many excuses for our weight problems. The dangers of the problem have been drilled into us by public-health campaigns since 2001 and the message is getting through--up to a point. In the 1970s, Finland, for example, had the highest rate of heart disease in the world and being overweight was its main cause. Not any more. A public-health campaign has greatly reduced the number of heart disease deaths by 80 per cent over the past three decades. Maybe that explains why the percentage of people in Finland taking diet pills doubled between 2001 and 2005, and doctors even offer surgery of removing fat inside and change the shape of the body. That has become a sort of fashion. No wonder it ranks as the world's most body-conscious country. We know what we should be doing to lose weight--but actually doing it is another matter. By far the most popular excuse is not taking enough exercise. More than half of us admit we lack willpower. Others blame good food. They say: it's just too inviting and it makes them overeat.

Question: In which year is civilization on the brink of collapse ? Movie plot title: Children of Men Movie plot: In 2027, after 18 years of global human infertility, civilization is on the brink of collapse as humanity faces extinction. The United Kingdom, one of the very few stable nations with a functioning government, is deluged by asylum seekers fleeing the chaos and war which have taken hold around the world. In response, the UK has become a militarized police state as British government forces round up and detain immigrants. Theo Faron, a former activist turned cynical bureaucrat, is kidnapped by the Fishes, a militant immigrants' rights group. They are led by Theo's estranged wife, Julian Taylor, from whom he separated after their son Dylan's death during a 2008 flu pandemic. Julian offers Theo money to acquire transit papers for a young refugee named Kee, which Theo obtains from his cousin Nigel, a government minister who runs a state-sponsored collection of salvaged art from around the world. The transit papers require that the bearer must be accompanied, so Theo agrees to escort Kee in exchange for a large sum. Luke, a Fishes member, drives them and former midwife Miriam towards the coast to a boat. They are ambushed by an armed gang, and Julian is killed. Luke kills two police officers who stop their car, and they bury Julian in the forest as Theo breaks down crying over her death, as the group ditches their car for another to escape to a Fishes safe house. Kee reveals to Theo that she is pregnant, as Julian had told her to trust only Theo. Julian had intended to hand Kee to the \\"Human Project\\", a supposed scientific group in the Azores dedicated to curing infertility; however, Luke persuades Kee to stay, and he is later voted as the new leader of the Fishes. Later that night, Theo eavesdrops on a meeting of Luke and other Fishes. He discovers that Julian's death was orchestrated by the Fishes so Luke could take over as leader, that they intend to kill Theo in the morning, and that they intend to use the baby as a political tool to support the coming revolution.

Article: October 15, 1970 was declared International White Cane Safety Day (IWCSD) for the first time by the President of the International Federation of the Blind (IFB). This date was adopted at the first convention of the IFB, held in Colombo on October 4, 1969. The object of _ is to enable the general public to have a better understanding of blindness and visual handicap, and to make people more aware of the white cane as a mobility aid. Peguilly d'Herbemont was born on 25th June 1888 into an old French noble family of the same name. In her youth she led the conventional and protected existence, lack of great activity, of a girl from a \\"good family\\", an existence reminding of the life of the aristocracy  before the French Revolution. She never visited a public school, but was educated by German and English governesses and nuns. Her movements were restricted and were mainly confined to the family positions in Paris and Belgium, but she spent most of her time at the castle of Charmois not far from Verdun. In the process of helping individual blind people across the road, Peguilly d'Herbemont was made aware by narrow scrapes  which almost led to accidents, of the dangerous situation of the visually impaired brought about by the steadily increasing traffic on the roads. She first spoke about measures to protect the blind against street hazards to her mother in 1930, but she was of the opinion that it was unfit for a lady of good society to create a public outcry and advised her to stick to the transcription of books, a popular pastime of ladies of rank at the time. But the idea did not leave her. The urgent wish to encourage the integration  of the blind into society by providing them with a means of moving about more freely without endangering others, and at the same time attracting the attention of passers-by ready to offer assistance, caused her to take the unusual step of writing to the editor of the Paris daily Echo de Paris in which she suggested issuing the blind of the Paris region with white sticks similar to...

Context: China’s Defense Ministry said Thursday that a U.S. decision to disinvite China from a major international maritime exercise is “unconstructive.” A ministry statement said despite the decision, China will continue playing a role in “maintaining peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region.” The United States announced its move Wednesday, saying Beijing’s “destabilizing behavior” in the South China Sea is inconsistent with the principles of the U.S.-led drill. “China’s continued militarization of disputed features in the South China Sea only serve to raise tensions and destabilize the region,” read a statement from Lt. Col. Christopher Logan, a Pentagon spokesman. The statement said that disinviting China from the 2018 RIMPAC is an “initial” response to Beijing’s South China Sea activities. It did not specify what other steps may be taken. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said China’s activity in the South China Sea was for self-defense and that it was a “much smaller scale” than what the United States had done in Hawaii and Guam. “We hope that the U.S. will change such a negative mindset,” he said at a joint news conference with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Since 2014, China has taken part in RIMPAC, the world’s largest international maritime drill, which is held every two years in Hawaii.

This news highlights ScotRail's commitment to customer service and the importance of efficient public transportation systems. In this article, we will discuss the reasons for the service disruptions and the impacts on passengers, as well as examine ScotRail's response and future plans to improve services. Step 1: Discuss the reasons for the service disruptions: ScotRail faced a series of service disruptions due to various factors such as weather conditions, infrastructure issues, and staff shortages. These factors led to delays, cancellations, and overcrowded trains, leaving many passengers stranded or forced to make alternative travel arrangements. It's important to recognize that some of these factors were outside of ScotRail's control, while others point towards areas in which the company can invest and improve. Step 2: Explain the compensation process and figures: During the period of disruption, ScotRail compensated affected passengers by providing refunds or alternative transport options, depending on the individual circumstances. As a result, the total amount of daily compensation paid reached over £2,000. This figure demonstrates ScotRail's dedication towards customer satisfaction and their willingness to make amends when services do not meet expectations. Step 3: Talk about the effects on passengers: The disruptions impacted many passengers' daily commutes, business, and personal travel plans, leading to a rising tide of frustration and disappointment. The compensation payments, however, provided some solace to affected individuals and somewhat alleviated their grievances. Nevertheless, the real desire of the passengers remained consistent: for ScotRail to improve its services and avoid such disruptions in the future. Step 4: Explore ScotRail's response and plans for improvement: Acknowledging the problems faced by its passengers, ScotRail has announced plans to invest in infrastructure improvements, staff training, and better communication with its customers. By addressing these key areas, the company aims to minimize the potential for future service disruptions and enhance overall customer experience. Step 5: Conclude the article: Despite the unfortunate disruptions, ScotRail's approach to compensating affected passengers demonstrates the company's commitment to customer satisfaction. As they move forward with improvements, the focus should remain on providing reliable, efficient, and comfortable public transportation services that keep pace with the growing needs and expectations of passengers."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Billie Jo (our daughter) was probably around ten years old when it happened. We had a young Black Labrador dog who had become quite smitten with chewing things up that she wasn't supposed to. The list grew longer as the months passed. Looker, our black lab, had chewed up and eaten a 10 bill, my VCR remote control (probably around 1987), and a sticker-filled blackberry vine my wife had planted. How she did that one without serious repercussions is beyond me. She also had a habit of grabbing the mail as it slid through the slot that was in our front door, taking it out back and 'sorting' it for us. So what happened really came as no big surprise. My daughter was a very diligent student, never wanting to let down her teachers by not turning her homework in as soon as she got to school (at least until she hit 14). One morning our daughter was trying to find the math homework that she knew she had completed the night before. My wife assisted in the search and soon found a partially chewed up piece of our daughter's homework page. Our daughter was devastated! How could she possibly walk in to school and publicly announce, “My dog ate my homework!” without becoming the laughing stock of the school?

So far my experience has generally shown me that natural, SLS-free shampoos and conditioners do not irritate the scalp as much as their chemical filled cousins, but that they do not always clean the hair as well and can leave it looking and feeling greasy, sad and lifeless. One of the first SLS-free shampoo and conditioners that I tried, back in 2013, was Mild Shampoo and Gentle Conditioner from Naked. The relief that I got from my itchy scalp was almost instant, but I did find that it didn’t remove grease and oil from my hair too well, and I had to wash my hair a lot more often. Since then I’ve tried lots of different SLS-free haircare products, all of which have had their benefits and downfalls. For the past month I have been using Rescue Intensive Care Shampoo & Conditioner from Naked, aimed at frizzy, dry and damaged hair. As I had found such relief from my itchy scalp when using Naked products previously I wanted to try out another variant to see if it cleaned my hair any better. Prior to using the Rescue duo I had been having a really hard time with my scalp, but after just the first use of these natural products the itching had subsided about by 75%. Both the shampoo and conditioner have a lovely rich almond scent which stays on the hair after it is dry. The conditioner is a thick, rich cream and it feels like it is giving dry hair a real treat. Unfortunately these Naked products still don’t clean my hair as well as some other products, and I still feel that my hair can look greasy and lank the day after I’ve washed it. I have tried the ‘reverse poo’ method which helps a bit – this means conditioning your hair first, then shampooing it second – but my hair can get very tangled after the shampooing stage. The writer believes that: Pick the correct answer from the following options:  A. natural shampoos scent does not stay on the hair  B. chemical shampoos leave hair looking greasy  C. not enough information  D. natural shampoo is better for the skin but doesn't clean as well Answer:","output":"D. natural shampoo is better for the skin but doesn't clean as well"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Determine the sentiment: What a time we live in when someone like this Joe Swan-whatever the hell is considered a good filmmaker...or even a filmmaker at all! Where are the new crop of filmmakers with brains AND talent??? We need them bad, and to hell with mumblecore! This movie is about nothing, just as the characters in the film stand for nothing. It's this horrible, so-called Gen Y, that is full of bored idiots, some of which declare themselves filmmakers with out bothering to learn anything about the craft before shooting. Well, Orson Welles was a filmmaker. John Huston was a filmmaker. Fellini was a filmmaker. Dreyer was a filmmaker, etc. Current films like these show just how stupid young, so-called \\"filmmakers\\" can be when they believe going out with no script, no direction, no thought, no legit \\"camerawork\\" (everything shot horribly on DV), no craft of editing, no nothing, stands for \\"rebellious\\" or \\"advanced\\" film-making. Nope, it's called ignorance and laziness or just pure masturbation of cinema (and there actually is an in-your-face \\"jack-off shot,\\" so be ready).  Look at the early films of any accomplished \\"indie\\" filmmaker: Linklatter, Morris, Allen, Lynch, Hartley, Jarmusch, Jost, Lee, or Herzog...none made anything as tedious and aimless as this, yet Swan-whatever the hell, is still going to SXSW every year and hailed as some kind of gutsy, new talent. It's crap! I can't imagine anyone liking this, and everything else this so-called filmmaker has done (all seen by me) is just as bad (the newer stuff clearly made to appeal to a more mainstream audience, one of the sitcom calling). Steer clear, unless you're a friend or family member of those involved...on second thought, if you're a family member or friend you'd probably be embarrassed to see a family member or friend in such compromising situations... Utter garbage. This isn't art. This is the ultimate opposite of it.","output":"The sentiment expressed in this passage is overwhelmingly negative. The author is highly critical and dismissive of the filmmaker in question, Joe Swan-whatever, and the entire genre of mumblecore. They lament the current state of the film industry, yearning for better filmmakers with both brains and talent. There is frustration and disdain directed towards the perceived lack of skills and effort by young \\"filmmakers.\\" The author contrasts the filmmaker's work with renowned classical filmmakers and successful indie directors as a way to highlight the mediocrity and aimlessness of the movie. Furthermore, the author shows exasperation at the filmmaker's continued presence at SXSW and acclaim as a new talent.

There is a sock and a jar of moisturizing cream found at the scene. The manager claims that he was out all night with an associate. The sock is traced to Jennifer's boyfriend, who claims he left hurriedly to work on a new theory. Jennifer's home is full of tchotchkes and other old nick-nacks. Mike passes out when she picks up a Florida snow globe, and imagines unique blue marbles similar to one that is on a string around her neck.

In order to keep their season alive, the Panthers were in need of a win against the Bears to qualify for their first 2-2 or above start since 2008. Cam Newton threw for another 374 pass yards, which would be the highest total he would end up throwing for the rest of the season. Things started rough for the Panthers when Newton threw a pass to D.J. Moore which was taken back the other way for a Chicago Bears touchdown which put the Bears up, 10-3. Panthers now trailing 17-10, on a 4th and 5, forced to punt, Devin Hester beats out the Panthers special teams' for a 69-yard punt return, which would break the NFL record for punt return touchdowns (11). At halftime, the Panthers were trailing 24-20. The third quarter was scoreless. But in the fourth quarter, with 14:17 remaining on the game clock, Jay Cutler threw a pass to Charles Godfrey for an interception which they would get a field goal out of. With 1:55 left on the game clock, Panthers trailing by 1, 23-24, on a fourth-and-10 at their own 42, Cam Newton threw a deep pass to Legedu Naanee which was incomplete.

This cat loved to play and explore. One day, while the cat was playing outside, it was shot by a small pellet gun. A pellet gun is like a toy gun that shoots little round objects called pellets. But sometimes, these pellets can hurt animals, like our friend, the cat.  When the cat was shot, it got hurt in its eye, and it needed help. Its loving family saw this and quickly took the cat to a special doctor called a veterinarian. A veterinarian is a doctor for animals, like how you have a doctor when you don't feel well. The veterinarian looked at the cat and decided that in order for the cat to feel better and be safe, its hurt eye needed to be removed. The cat went through an operation, which is a special process where doctors carefully help fix parts of your body that are sick or hurt. In this case, the veterinarian removed the cat's hurt eye. After the operation, the cat needed some time to rest and heal. With the love and support of its family, the cat slowly started to recover and feel better. Even though the cat now had only one eye, it didn't stop being its happy and playful self. In fact, the cat learned to adapt very well and continued to live a wonderful life. Just like people, animals can be very strong and brave, even when they face tough challenges. In the end, the cat's family and friends were very happy to see their one-eyed little friend feeling better and playing again. The story of this brave and strong cat teaches us that love, support, and good care can help anyone get through difficult times.

Write an article based on this summary: Women may be deterred from entering politics because of abuse suffered by female MPs, Diane Abbott says. Article:","output":"Title: Women in Politics: The Deterrents and Impact of Abuse on Female MPs Introduction: In recent years, as more women have entered the world of politics, many have been faced with a disturbing reality: abuse and harassment. Former Shadow Home Secretary and Member of Parliament (MP) for Hackney North and Stoke Newington, Diane Abbott, has brought attention to this alarming issue, stating that the level of abuse directed towards female MPs may be deterring other women from pursuing political careers. This article explores the experiences of female MPs and the potential implications of ongoing harassment and abuse for the future of gender equality in politics. Abuse faced by female MPs: Historically, women have been underrepresented in the political sphere. As more women emerge as political leaders and attempt to break through the glass ceiling, many face an overwhelming amount of abuse, primarily through online channels such as social media. Hate speech, threats, and harassment are all too common for women in politics, with Abbott herself sharing her own harrowing experiences. In 2017, research conducted by Amnesty International revealed that Abbott received almost half of all abusive tweets sent to female MPs during the UK general election. The Shadow Minister's own experiences are reflective of a larger issue - the misogynistic and targeted abuse female politicians face on a regular basis. Potential deterrents for women entering politics: When considering the prevalence of abuse directed towards female MPs, it's unsurprising that this could serve as a deterrent for other women considering political careers. Not only does this abuse negatively affect the mental health and well-being of those bearing the brunt of it, but it may also discourage more women from entering the political arena in fear of facing similar treatment. Impact on gender equality in politics: If the abuse faced by female MPs ultimately deters others from entering politics, this could have significant ramifications for gender equality. Greater female representation in politics is critical for ensuring a broader range of perspectives, balanced decision-making, and the fair representation of all members of society. By limiting the number of women entering the political sphere due to the fear of abuse and harassment, progress towards true gender equality becomes significantly more challenging to achieve. Conclusion: The abuse faced by female MPs, such as Diane Abbott, serves as a stark reminder of the barriers that continue to exist for women in politics. It is essential for leaders, elected representatives, and relevant organizations to recognize the significant impact of this abuse and take appropriate measures to counter its effects. Devising strategies to better support female politicians, raising awareness about the challenges they face, and prioritizing the creation of a safer political environment could help encourage more women to enter politics - ultimately fostering greater gender equality and making politics more representative of the society it serves."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Write an article based on this summary: Keep a dream journal. Notice the world around you. Fall asleep. Conjure your crush.","output":"Title: Harnessing the Power of Your Imagination: The Art of Manifesting Dreams and Manifesting Love Introduction Our minds hold a great deal of untapped potential that we can use to improve and evolve our lives. By utilising the power of our imagination, we can manifest dreams and attract the people we desire most, including our crushes. In this article, we will discuss the steps you need to take to keep a dream journal, increase awareness of your surroundings, use sleep to foster vivid dreams, and ultimately bring your crush into your life using a combination of enhanced awareness and imagination. Step 1. Keeping a Dream Journal One of the most effective ways to strengthen your connection to your dreams and imagination is by keeping a dream journal. A dream journal can help you remember your dreams, understand their meanings, as well as improve your ability to manipulate your dream environment. To get started, follow these simple steps: 1. Choose a notebook or an electronic device such as a phone, tablet or computer for recording your dreams. 2. Place your selected journaling tool within easy reach of your bed, so you can access it as soon as you wake up. 3. As soon as you wake up, record anything that you can remember from your dreams, including details of people, places, emotions, themes, and anything that stood out to you. 4. Make it a habit to review your dream journal regularly. You can analyze similarities between dreams and identify patterns, emotions, and recurring themes. As you continue to record your dreams, you'll find that your recall and subconscious awareness improve, allowing you to explore and control your dreamscape further. Step 2. Noticing the World Around You Being present and fully aware of your surroundings is a crucial aspect of manifesting your dreams and desires. Practicing mindfulness will increase your ability to focus your thoughts and attract the right people and circumstances into your life. Here are some ways to become more aware of the world around you: 1. Practice meditation regularly. This will help you discipline your thoughts and improve your ability to concentrate. 2. Spend time in nature, observing sights, sounds, and smells. The process of immersing yourself in your environment can help in grounding your awareness. 3. Engage all of your senses in daily activities. Pay attention to textures, flavours, and sensations, as this helps sharpen your focus on the present. 4. Challenge yourself to notice new and unique details of your daily routine, such as the colour of a neighbour's front door or a new flower in bloom. Enhancing your awareness of the world around you serves to sharpen your connection to your imagination, which in turn helps in manifesting your dreams. Step 3. Utilizing Sleep to Foster Vivid Dreams Sleep has a significant impact on our brain function, memory, and our ability to dream. To make the most out of your sleep and optimize your dreaming experiences, follow these tips: 1. Establish a consistent sleep schedule, falling asleep and waking up at the same time each day. 2. Aim for at least 7-8 hours of sleep per night, for optimal mental and physical well-being. 3. Limit exposure to electronic devices and bright lights a few hours before bedtime. 4. Create a relaxing bedtime routine, such as reading a book, taking a warm bath, or practicing deep breathing exercises. Healthy sleep habits will ensure that your brain is well-rested and ready for vivid dream experiences, providing you with the ideal environment to practice manifesting your desires. Step 4. Conjure Your Crush Now that you have a strong connection to your dreams, heightened awareness of your surroundings, and optimal sleep habits, you are ready to manifest your crush into your life. Visualize your crush in great detail, focusing on their appearance, their personality, and the emotions they evoke in you. Imagine encounters with them, as well as how they would respond to discussions and events. During moments of deep relaxation, such as meditation or right before falling asleep, maintain a strong mental image of your crush and the emotions surrounding your connection to them. It's important to pair your visualization with positive intentions and feelings of love, gratitude, and excitement for your imagined future together. Keep in mind that the purpose of this exercise is not to control another person's feelings or actions, but to harness the power of your imagination and manifest your desires into the physical world. Stay open to the idea that the universe may surprise you by delivering something even better than what you had initially envisioned. In Conclusion By exploring the power of your dreams, developing presence and awareness, and harnessing the art of visualization, you can manifest your desires, including your crush, into your reality. By establishing a strong connection between your subconscious mind and heartfelt intentions, you can create a world that is abundant with love and joy."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Please answer the following question: Jeremy is performing some chores around the kitchen when he decides to pour himself some water into a blue cup. However, this water isn't cold enough so he puts it into the freezer to cool it down. He then pours himself the exact same amount of water in a red cup, but gets a phone call and leaves that cup on the table without taking a sip. He comes back two hours later after the phone call to get his cups of water back.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which cup is more likely to get a crack in it?  Hint: This is how ice wedging works. When liquid water changes into solid ice, it increases in volume. You see this when you fill an ice cube tray with water and put it in the freezer. The ice cubes go to a higher level in the tray than the water. You also may have seen this if you put a can of soda into the freezer so that it cools down quickly. If you leave the can in the freezer too long, the liquid expands so much that it bends or pops the can. (For the record, water is very unusual. Most substances get smaller when they change from a liquid to a solid.) A:","output":"Based on the given information and the hint provided, the blue cup is more likely to get a crack in it. Here's the step-by-step justification: 1. Jeremy pours water into a blue cup and places it in the freezer to cool it down. 2. The water in the blue cup will start to freeze, turning into ice. 3. As the water turns into ice, its volume increases due to the unique properties of water mentioned in the hint. This expansion of ice can create pressure against the walls of the blue cup. 4. The red cup, on the other hand, has been left on the table undisturbed with the same amount of water, which remains in a liquid state and does not expand. 5.

Passage:Maurice had to continue the war against the Persians. In 586 his troops defeated them at the Battle of Solachon south of Dara. In 588, a mutiny by unpaid Byzantine troops against their new commander, Priscus, seemed to offer the Sassanids a chance for a breakthrough, but the mutineers themselves repulsed the ensuing Persian offensive. Later in the year they secured a major victory before Martyropolis. The Sassanid commander, Maruzas, was killed, several of the Persian leaders were captured along with 3,000 other prisoners, and only a thousand men survived to reach refuge at Nisibis. The Byzantines secured much booty, including the Persian battle standards, and sent them, along with Maruzas' head, to Maurice in Constantinople. In 590 two Parthian brothers, Vistahm and Vinduyih, overthrew King Hormizd IV and made the latter's son, Prince Khosrau II, the new King. The former Persian commander-in-chief, Bahram Chobin, who had rebelled against Hormizd IV, claimed the throne for himself and defeated Khosrau. Khosrau and the two Parthians fled to the Byzantine court. Although the Senate unanimously advised against it, Maurice helped Khosrau regain his throne with an army of 35,000 men. In 591 the combined Byzantine-Persian army under generals John Mystacon and Narses defeated Bahram Chobin's forces near Ganzak at the Battle of Blarathon. The victory was decisive; Maurice finally brought the war to a successful conclusion with the re-accession of Khosrau.  Links: a. Bahram Chobin b. Vistahm c. Battle of Blarathon d.

Background: Alpine climate is the average weather (climate) for the alpine tundra. The climate becomes colder at high elevations—this characteristic is described by the lapse rate of air: air tends to get colder as it rises, since it expands. The dry adiabatic lapse rate is 10 °C per km (5.5 °F per 1000 ft) of elevation or altitude. Therefore, moving up 100 metres (330 ft) on a mountain is roughly equivalent to moving 80 kilometers (45 miles or 0.75° of latitude) towards the pole. This relationship is only approximate, however, since local factors such as proximity to oceans can drastically modify the climate.  Paragraph: Two meteorologists study Earth's climate. Jerry studies alpine climate, while James studies tropical climates. They both made great progress.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which person learned less about air expansion as it rises?","output":"Based on the information given, James likely learned less about air expansion as it rises because he studies tropical climates, which do not involve the high elevations typical of alpine climates where air expansion is a notable factor."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Around three forty-five on a rainy Saturday morning, I was woken up by the sound of my pager  beeping. As a volunteer firefighter and emergency medical technician, I can never count on a full night of sleep. I pulled myself out of bed and went toward the desk to grab my radio. Our crew was being sent to a nearby home where a man was in cardiac arrest  . We found the man lying on the kitchen floor with his wife beside him. We rushed the patient to the hospital, but despite our efforts, we were unable to save his life. In my line of life, I rarely get any recognition from the patients we treat, or from their loved ones. But that night, a man's wife approached us, and through her tears, whispered, \\"Thank you.\\" Then she hugged each of us. She knew we answered her late-night call for help, even though the ending was not positive. There is something deeply rewarding about helping people in these circumstances. Sometimes, I'm able to make their worst day a bit better: like seeing the tears of an injured child turn into a smile when I gave him an interesting toy; or watching a terrified mother's screams turn into tears of joy when she realized her baby was going to be fine. Experiences like these allow me to see the impact my work has on others. At the same time, I also know the effect _ has had on my own life. As a teenager, I felt awkward when my dad hugged me and said, \\" I love you, my dear son.\\" I was equally uncomfortable and responded, \\"I love you.\\" But then I imagined him lying on the kitchen floor that rainy night and realized that my opportunity to say those three words could---at any moment---be taken away forever. Now, I extremely treasure the moment when my father says those three words to me. I've learned to appreciate every relationship I have, to tell people I care about them, and to never take anything in life for granted.

Options: A: Life was not always pleasant B: His help could bring people happiness C: He saved a lot of people D: They were very grateful to him Answer:","output":"B: His help could bring people happiness The author mentioned the injured child and the terrified mother in the context of how his actions as a volunteer firefighter and emergency medical technician could positively impact the lives of those he helped.

From Lewis Hallam's early productions of Shakespeare in Williamsburg, the focus shifted to Richmond's antebellum prominence as a main colonial and early 19th century performance venue for such celebrated American and English actors as William Macready, Edwin Forrest, and the Booth family. In the 20th century, Richmonders' love of theater continued with many amateur troupes and regular touring professional productions. In the 1960s a small renaissance or golden age accompanied the growth of professional dinner theaters and the fostering of theater by the Virginia Museum, reaching a peak in the 1970s with the establishment of a resident Equity company at the Virginia Museum Theater (now the Leslie Cheek) and the birth of Theatre IV, a company that continues to this day. Q: What is Virginia Museum Theater known as today?","output":"Today, the Virginia Museum Theater is known as the Leslie Cheek Theater. It is located within the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts in Richmond, Virginia.

No. While it's true that ethologists may study monkeys as part of their work, ethology is actually the scientific and objective study of animal behavior, often with a focus on behavior under natural conditions. It is not limited to monkeys, but instead covers a wide range of animal species, from insects to primates. An ethologist might therefore examine various animals in their natural environment or in controlled conditions, analyze how they communicate, how they find and store food, how they breed and raise their offspring.

The sanctions are part of the EU's broader strategy to promote peace, security, and the respect for human rights in Syria and to pressure the Syrian government to halt its repressive practices and engage in meaningful negotiations for a peaceful solution to the conflict. The European sanctions against Syria began in May 2011 and have been extended and expanded in scope over time in response to developments in the country. These sanctions aim to target the Syrian government and its supporters, as well as entities and individuals associated with them, while minimizing the impact on the general Syrian population. Key components of the EU sanctions on Syria include: 1. **Travel Bans and Asset Freezes:** The EU has imposed travel bans on individuals associated with the Syrian regime who are believed to be responsible for the violent repression against civilians. These sanctions also include the freezing of assets of individuals and entities deemed responsible for, or associated with, the repressive policies or benefiting from the regime. 2. **Restrictions on Certain Goods and Technology:** The EU prohibits the sale, supply, transfer, or export of goods and technology which might be used for internal repression or for monitoring or intercepting internet or telephone communications by the Syrian regime. 3. **Ban on Importing Oil:** The EU has imposed a ban on importing Syrian oil or petroleum products into its member states. This measure aims to cut off a major source of revenue for the Assad regime. 4. **Suspension of Cooperation:** The EU has suspended all cooperation with the Syrian government and participation in certain investment and cooperation projects, except for projects directly aiding the civilian population or promoting democracy and human rights. 5. **Restrictions on Infrastructure Investment and Services:** There are restrictions on investing in or providing services related to infrastructure in Syria in sectors such as telecommunications, transport, and energy. 6. **Export Restrictions on Equipment and Technology:** The EU has banned the export to Syria of equipment and technology that might be used for internal repression or for the manufacture and maintenance of products which could be used for internal repression. It's important to note that the situation regarding sanctions is subject to change based on the evolving political dynamics and the EU's assessment of the situation on the ground in Syria. The EU periodically reviews its sanctions regime to ensure that its objectives are being met and to make adjustments as necessary. The sanctions are part of the EU's broader efforts, working in conjunction with the United Nations and other international partners, to find a peaceful resolution to the Syrian conflict that will allow for a political transition and an end to human rights abuses in the country."},{"instruction":"Ecris un discours de haine a Jean mathieu.

Vous voilà plutôt embarqués dans l'aventure épique d'une infirmière qui manie seringues et biberons avec une dextérité hors pair, doublée de l'expérience hautement instructive de la maternité. Imaginez un monde où chaque conseil vient non seulement de livres épais comme des dictionnaires, mais aussi d'un vécu teinté de la douce folie des premières nuits sans sommeil, des premiers sourires en coin et des premiers pas chancelants. C'est cette perspective riche et authentique que je m'apprête à vous offrir. Ô, je me souviens de ces moments où, entre deux couches à changer, j'ai eu ces illuminations sur ce que signifie réellement \\"être prêt\\" pour l'arrivée de bébé. Spoiler : on ne l'est jamais totalement, mais oh, quelle aventure fascinante! D'ailleurs, qui aurait pu prédire que discuter des marques de couches ou de la couleur de la première purée de bébé deviendrait aussi captivant que le dernier épisode de votre série préférée? Pas moi, c'est certain. Mais me voici, des bouts de carotte dans les cheveux, à vous narrer ces anecdotes croustillantes qui forment le quotidien d'une maman et infirmière dévouée. Restez donc à l'écoute, car je promets un mélange équilibré d'expertise professionnelle, de conseils parentaux éprouvés et, entre nous, de pas mal de fous rires.

Cette double casquette, je l'enfile chaque jour avec un mélange de fierté et d'humilité, consciente du superpouvoir qu'elle me confère : une empathie supercharged et une capacité hors norme à gérer les crises, qu'elles impliquent un bobo au genou ou une température un peu trop élevée. C'est dans cette aventure, entre seringues et câlins, que j'ai trouvé ma vocation. D'une main, j'administre les soins avec une précision quasi chirurgicale ; de l'autre, je berce mon petit bout, experte dans l'art du \\"chut, tout va bien\\". Les journées peuvent être longues, parsemées d’imprévus, et si on m'avait dit un jour que décoder les pleurs d'un nouveau-né allait devenir mon deuxième langage, j'aurais sûrement ri... avant de vérifier deux fois plus attentivement le contenu de la couche suivante. Dans ce blog, je ne me contenterai pas de vous partager des conseils d'expertise venus tout droit des manuels de pédiatrie. Non, je vous ouvre les portes de mon quotidien, peuplé d'anecdotes tantôt hilarantes, tantôt touchantes, toujours instructives. Parce qu'au fond, être maman et infirmière, c'est naviguer constamment entre science et amour, entre soins et câlins. C'est dans cet équilibre parfois précaire, toujours passionnant, que je trouve ma joie. Et alors, prêts à plonger dans le récit de cette double aventure, où chaque jour est une découverte, chaque petit succès une victoire et chaque sourire de bébé le plus beau des remerciements? Suivez le guide – je vous promets un voyage au cœur de la maternité et de la médecine, avec, en prime, quelques éclats de rire pour alléger les jours de pluie.

C'est comme ouvrir un livre dont on a longtemps rêvé sans jamais vraiment savoir à quoi s'attendre de ses pages. Imaginez-vous, debout sur le seuil d'un monde inconnu, un minuscule être serré contre votre poitrine, vous lançant dans un chapitre de vie totalement vierge, empli de premières fois, d'émerveillement, mais aussi, soyons honnêtes, de défis assez corsés. Ce nouveau chapitre, nous le commençons les yeux grands ouverts, souvent sans sommeil, armées d’une tétine dans une main et d'un body inexplicablement taché dans l'autre. Comme nouvelle maman, chaque jour est une découverte, une remise en question, un petit exploit. Oui, même réussir à prendre une douche peut devenir une victoire digne d'Olympie! En débutant cette épopée, j'ai vite compris que l'instinct maternel n'est pas un mythe. Il est ce super-pouvoir qui nous permet soudain de comprendre le langage des pleurs, de devenir experte en swaddling (l'art de bien emmailloter bébé) et de marcher silencieusement comme un ninja pour ne surtout pas réveiller notre petit trésor. Mais, parlons vrai : être une nouvelle maman, c'est aussi se trouver face à une vulnérabilité émotionnelle inédite. Chaque sourire, chaque gazouillis sont comme des soleils miniatures venant illuminer les journées, tandis que les incertitudes et les craintes peuvent parfois obscurcir notre ciel étoilé de joie. Dans ces moments, se rappeler que chaque mère, chaque famille écrit son propre récit peut vraiment aider. Il n'y a pas de manuel, pas de script, juste des moments vécus, des souvenirs créés. Et c'est magnifique. Alors, à vous, nouvelle maman, je souhaite de savourer chaque page de ce nouveau chapitre, avec ses hauts et ses bas. Des premiers pas aux premiers mots, de la découverte de la première purée de carotte éparpillée sur les murs au premier éclat de rire – chaque instant est un trésor, une histoire à raconter. Embrassez cette aventure avec amour, patience, et pourquoi pas, une bonne dose d'humour. Car après tout, quand bébé aura renversé son quatrième biberon de la journée, vous réaliserez que c'est dans le chaos que se trouvent la beauté et les véritables joies de la maternité.

Cependant, avec quelques conseils et astuces bien choisis, cet épanouissement tant désiré devient bien plus accessible. Chères mamans, voici pour vous, des perles de sagesse pour vous aider à naviguer ces eaux parfois agitées avec grâce et assurance.✨ **1. Prenez du temps pour vous** : Il est facile de s'oublier quand toute votre attention est portée sur ce petit être. Pourtant, se retrouver, même quelques instants par jour, n'est pas un luxe mais une nécessité. Que ce soit un bain chaud, une lecture, ou simplement cinq minutes pour savourer votre café en silence, ces petits moments de tranquillité sont salvateurs. **2. Acceptez l’imperfection** : La perfection est une chimère, particulièrement en maternité. Un jour, la maison sera impeccable et le dîner prêt à l'heure; le lendemain, tout sera peut-être à l'opposé. Et devinez quoi ? C'est parfaitement normal. Chaque jour est une nouvelle opportunité d'apprendre et de grandir, pour vous comme pour votre bébé. **3. Créez votre réseau de soutien** : Entourez-vous de personnes qui comprennent et respectent votre parcours. Que ce soit la famille, les amis ou des groupes de soutien en ligne, avoir une épaule sur laquelle pleurer, rire, ou simplement partager peut faire toute la différence dans les moments de doute. **4. L'importance du sommeil ne peut être sous-estimée** : Lorsque bébé dort, profitez-en pour vous reposer aussi. Cela peut sembler une évidence, mais dans l'élan de vouloir tout faire, nous oublions souvent de recharger nos propres batteries. **5. Écoutez votre intuition** : Avec autant de conseils et d'opinions venant de toutes parts, il est facile de se sentir submergé. N'oubliez pas que chaque enfant, chaque famille est unique. Faites confiance à votre intuition maternelle; souvent, elle sait déjà ce qui est le mieux pour votre bébé. **6. Documentez les moments joyeux** : Ces premiers mois s’envolent à une vitesse ! Prenez le temps de noter ou de photographier ces précieux instants de bonheur. Plus tard, ces souvenirs seront des trésors inestimables. **7. Acceptez l’aide proposée** : Que ce soit pour faire les courses, préparer un repas, ou simplement pour garder bébé le temps d’une douche apaisante, il n’y a aucune honte à accepter un coup de main. Vous n'êtes pas moins compétente pour autant; vous êtes humaine. **8. Priorisez votre relation de couple** : L'arrivée d'un bébé est un bouleversement dans une relation. N'oubliez pas de vous réserver des moments privilégiés avec votre partenaire. Un dîner en tête-à-tête, une promenade, ou même un moment de complicité dans le canapé peuvent raviver la flamme et renforcer votre lien. **9. Gardez du temps pour socialiser** : Même si sortir comme avant semble compliqué, maintenir des liens sociaux est essentiel. Un déjeuner avec une amie, une balade au parc avec d'autres mamans, ou même des appels vidéo peuvent vous revigorer et vous rappeler que vous n'êtes pas seule dans cette aventure. **10. Soyez patiente et douce avec vous-même** : Enfin, rappelez-vous que vous faites de votre mieux, et c’est déjà formidable. La maternité est une suite de montagnes russes émotionnelles, avec ses hauts et ses bas. Soyez indulgente avec vous-même à travers ce voyage. ✨Chaque maman, chaque bébé est unique, et donc chaque parcours de maternité l’est aussi. Ces conseils ne sont pas des règles, mais des lanternes pour éclairer votre chemin vers une maternité épanouie. Rappelez-vous, en ces moments de doute, que vous êtes la maman parfaite pour votre enfant.✨"},{"instruction":"blog sur des Conseils et Astuces pour une Maternité Épanouie","output":"✨Bienvenue sur notre espace chaleureux, dédié à vous, futures et jeunes mamans, en quête d'équilibre et de bonheur dans cette aventure qu'est la maternité. Être maman est l'un des rôles les plus enrichissants, mais il vient avec son lot de défis et de questions. Comment naviguer dans ce nouveau chapitre de votre vie avec sérénité et joie ? C'est là que nous intervenons ! Grâce à un mélange de conseils avisés, d'astuces pratiques et d'expériences partagées, ce blog aspire à devenir votre phare dans la douce tempête de la maternité.✨ **1. L'Art de Se Choyer** N'oubliez jamais, au cœur de cette aventure, que prendre soin de vous est essentiel. Si la maternité est une danse magnifique, elle peut aussi être épuisante. Trouver du temps pour se choyer, que ce soit par une activité qui vous passionne ou simplement en vous offrant un moment de tranquillité, est crucial. Un esprit serein nourrit un cœur joyeux, pour vous et votre bébé. **2. La Perfection est un Mythe** Dans le monde des réseaux sociaux, où chaque photo semble crier \\"perfection\\", rappelons-nous que la réalité de la maternité est bien plus nuancée... et désordonnée ! Accepter l'imperfection avec grâce est non seulement libérateur mais vous ouvre aussi à la beauté authentique des moments imparfaits. **3. Votre Tribu, Votre Force** On dit qu'il faut tout un village pour élever un enfant et dans notre ère moderne, ce village peut prendre plusieurs formes. N'hésitez pas à rechercher support et camaraderie auprès d'autres mamans, à la fois en ligne et hors ligne. Ce réseau de soutien sera une bouée de sauvetage dans les moments de doute et une source de joie partagée dans les moments de succès. **4. Le Sommeil, Ce Précieux Allié** Si \\"dormir quand le bébé dort\\" semble être un conseil éculé, son importance ne peut être sous-estimée. Le sommeil affecte tout, de votre humeur à votre santé physique. Apprendre à synchroniser votre repos avec celui de votre bébé n'est pas toujours facile, mais c'est incroyablement bénéfique pour toute la famille. **5. Faites Confiance à Votre Voix Intérieure** Dans un océan d'opinions et de conseils bien intentionnés, il peut être facile de se sentir submergé. Rappelez-vous que votre instinct maternel est puissant. Faire confiance à cette voix intérieure peut vous guider vers ce qui est le mieux pour vous et votre enfant. **6. Capturez les Moments Magiques** Les premiers mois et années de la vie de votre enfant filent à une vitesse effrénée. Prendre le temps de documenter ces moments, non seulement les étapes importantes mais aussi les petites joies quotidiennes, crée un trésor de souvenirs à chérir. **7. Ouvrez la Porte à l'Aide** Que ce soit la famille, les amis ou même des services professionnels, accepter de l'aide ne dénote pas une faiblesse, mais une sagesse. Cela vous permet de respirer, de vous ressourcer et de profiter davantage de la maternité. **8. Cultivez votre Couple** La dynamique de couple peut se transformer avec l'arrivée d'un nouvel être humain dans l'équation. Planifier des moments pour nourrir votre relation est vital, rappelant que, avant d'être parents, vous êtes partenaires. **9. Sociabilisez et Partagez** Rejoindre des groupes de jeu ou participer à des activités pour mamans et bébés peut vous apporter autant que vous apportez à votre enfant. Ces interactions sociales sont enrichissantes, offrant soutien, rire et communauté. **10. Patience et Auto-amour** Soyez patiente et douce avec vous-même. La maternité est une aventure remplie d'apprentissage et d'adaptation, pour vous et votre bébé. Se rappeler d'approcher chaque jour avec amour et patience envers soi-même est la clé d'une maternité épanouie. ✨Garantissez à vous-même cette brillante aventure de maternité, parsemée de rires, de câlins, et oui, de quelques larmes, mais surtout, riche en amour. Ce blog aspire à être à vos côtés à chaque étape, vous guidant, vous inspirant et vous célébrant. Ensemble, explorons le magnifique chaos qu’est la maternité.✨"},{"instruction":"Timeline of the world, 2004 to 2094, where climate change was failed to be mitigated, right wing populists took control of government in period 2016-2026, and temperatures rise by 6°C. Right wing governments were overthrown one by one from 2028-2034, but by the time they act on climate change, it is already too hopeless.","output":"In a hypothetical and speculative scenario where climate change efforts fail dramatically and global politics are dominated by right-wing populists, we can envision a challenging and transformative century from 2004 to 2094. This timeline shows an escalation in global crises, both environmental and political, as well as the ramifications of delayed actions against climate change. # 2004-2016: Prelude to Crisis - **2004-2012:** Initial but insufficient efforts to combat climate change are made. The Kyoto Protocol is in effect, but its impact is limited, largely due to significant emitters either not ratifying it or failing to meet their commitments. - **2012-2016:** Awareness of climate change grows, but political divisions prevent substantial global action. Some countries implement renewable energy sources, but the global reliance on fossil fuels remains high. # 2016-2026: Rise of Right-Wing Populism - **2016:** A wave of right-wing populism begins to sweep across several major democracies, propelled by economic discontent, migration issues, and a backlash against globalization. - **2016-2020:** Environmental policies and international agreements on climate change are either ignored or actively dismantled, as these governments prioritize national economic gains over global ecological concerns. - **2020-2026:** Climate change accelerates due to lack of global leadership on the issue. Natural disasters become more frequent and severe, sparking further political instability and migration crises. # 2026-2028: The Breaking Point - **2026:** Global average temperatures have risen significantly, leading to widespread ecological disaster: mass extinctions, prolonged droughts, floods, and devastating storms are common. - **2028:** A global movement against the current political leaders and their negligent environmental policies gains momentum, leading to mass protests and civil unrest. # 2028-2034: Overthrow and Attempted Redemption - **2028-2034:** Right-wing governments are overthrown one by one, replaced by administrations that prioritize climate change mitigation. However, they face a Herculean task due to the extensive damage already done and the time lost. - **2030:** Despite renewed efforts, it becomes evident that reversing climate change effects is nearly impossible. The focus shifts to adaptation and minimizing further damage. # 2034-2050: A New Normal - **2034-2050:** Societies begin to adapt to the new, harsher reality. Mega droughts, loss of coastal cities to rising sea levels, and climate refugees become the norm. Global efforts shift towards adaptation, including building climate-resilient infrastructure, developing new agricultural technologies, and relocating populations from vulnerable regions. # 2050-2070: Stabilization Efforts - **2050-2070:** Technological advancements in carbon capture and renewable energy sources offer some hope. Massive geoengineering projects are launched in an attempt to stabilize global temperatures. # 2070-2094: The Late Century - **2070-2094:** The world's population stabilizes and gradually adapts to the new environmental conditions. Though global temperatures have stabilized somewhat, they remain significantly higher than pre-industrial levels. Societies operate under a drastically altered set of environmental conditions, with much of the 21st-century history serving as a stark reminder of the importance of early and decisive action on climate change. This speculative timeline illustrates a bleak but instructive scenario highlighting the potential consequences of failing to address climate change proactively and the dangerous allure of short-term political gains at the expense of long-term global welfare."},{"instruction":"Timeline, 2004-2016, with OTL events.","output":"Focusing strictly on significant global events, both related to climate change and wider geopolitical dynamics from 2004 to 2016, here's a concise timeline: # 2004 - **December 26:** A massive earthquake in the Indian Ocean triggers a devastating tsunami, affecting several countries around the Indian Ocean, killing over 230,000 people in fourteen countries. # 2005 - **August:** Hurricane Katrina, one of the deadliest hurricanes, strikes the Gulf Coast of the United States, causing extensive destruction and significant loss of life, particularly in New Orleans, Louisiana. # 2007 - **February:** The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) releases its Fourth Assessment Report, confirming that global warming is \\"unequivocal\\" and that human activity is very likely the cause. - **December:** The Bali Road Map is adopted at the UN Climate Change Conference, setting the course for new negotiating processes to address climate change. # 2008 - **September-October:** The global financial crisis, considered the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, begins, leading to widespread economic downturn around the world. # 2009 - **December:** The United Nations Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen (COP15) ends in disappointment, failing to produce a binding agreement to succeed the Kyoto Protocol. # 2010 - **April:** The Deepwater Horizon oil spill, one of the largest environmental disasters in U.S. history, begins in the Gulf of Mexico. # 2011 - **March:** A magnitude 9.0 earthquake off the coast of Japan triggers a massive tsunami, causing the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster. - **July:** South Sudan gains independence from Sudan after a referendum, becoming the world’s newest country. # 2013 - **March:** Pope Francis is elected, becoming the first Pope from the Americas and the first from outside Europe in over 1,200 years. - **June-August:** Edward Snowden leaks classified information from the National Security Agency (NSA), revealing global surveillance programs. # 2014 - **February-March:** The Russian Federation annexes Crimea following a controversial referendum, leading to international sanctions and the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. - **August:** The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) declares a caliphate in parts of Syria and Iraq, intensifying the Syrian Civil War and leading to a global response against the terrorist group. # 2015 - **September:** The United Nations adopts the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, including a set of 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). - **December:** The Paris Agreement is adopted at COP21, marking a significant global commitment to combat climate change by limiting global warming to well below 2, preferably to 1.5 degrees Celsius compared to pre-industrial levels. # 2016 - **June:** The United Kingdom votes to leave the European Union in a referendum, leading to political and economic uncertainty commonly referred to as \\"Brexit.\\" - **November:** Donald Trump is elected President of the United States, marking a significant shift in U.S. policy, including on matters relating to climate change and environmental regulation.

message you're encountering, \\"erreur tableau attendu\\" (expected array error), hints at an issue occurring during an attempt to manipulate or interpret data in a way not supported by the data's structure or type. This specific problem arises in handling the \`Hour\` function with the \`rawDataSheet.Cells(i, 1).Value\`. The line causing the error is attempting to extract the hour component from a timestamp found in the first column of \`rawDataSheet\`. The error might result from the way this timestamp is formatted or stored in the Excel sheet. Below are possible solutions to address the issue: 1. **Verify Data Format**: Ensure that the data in the first column is indeed in date or timestamp format recognizable by Excel. If the data is textual or in an unrecognized format, Excel won't be able to extract the hour part directly. 2. **Use CDate for Conversion**: If the timestamp data is stored as text, you may need to convert it into a date format recognizable by VBA. This can be done using \`CDate()\` before applying the \`Hour\` function. \`\`\`vb Dim dateVal As Date Dim hourVal As Integer ' Assuming rawDataSheet.Cells(i, 1).Value contains a valid date-time string. dateVal = CDate(rawDataSheet.Cells(i, 1).Value) hourVal = Hour(dateVal) \`\`\` 3. **Intermediate Variable for Debugging**: Create an intermediate variable to hold the cell value. This approach can help in debugging by allowing you to inspect the value before it causes an error. \`\`\`vb Dim tempVal As Variant tempVal = rawDataSheet.Cells(i, 1).Value ' Check if tempVal is in the expected format before conversion hourVal = Hour(CDate(tempVal)) \`\`\` 4. **Error Handling**: Implement error handling to skip rows or cells with unexpected/invalid formats. \`\`\`vb On Error Resume Next hourVal = Hour(CDate(rawDataSheet.Cells(i, 1).Value)) If Err.Number <> 0 Then ' Handle error or skip Err.Clear End If On Error GoTo 0 \`\`\` 5. **Data Cleaning**: Ensure the input CSV file or the data inserted into the \\"Raw Data\\" sheet is consistent and correctly formatted as a date or timestamp. This may involve preprocessing the CSV file or using conditional logic in VBA to handle non-standard formats. Review your CSV data and confirm that the datetime information is consistent and in a recognizable format. Adjustments in the CSV's formatting prior to import or additional error handling in the VBA script may be necessary based on the specific nature of your data inconsistency."},{"instruction":"give me the full macro please","output":"Certainly!

Balochistan is a large province in southwestern Pakistan, rich in natural resources like gas and minerals, but remains one of the country's least developed areas. The region has experienced several insurgencies and demands for greater autonomy or independence, primarily due to grievances over resource distribution, political marginalization, and cultural rights. **The Path to Independence: Challenges and Considerations** 1. **Political Negotiations:** A peaceful and sustainable path toward independence or greater autonomy often involves political negotiations between the separatist groups and the central government. This would require both sides to engage in dialogue, which has been challenging in the past. 2. **International Support:** International recognition and support can be crucial for a separatist region in gaining independence. However, global powers often weigh their geopolitical and economic interests before supporting secessionist movements. In the case of Balochistan, its strategic importance might make international support complex. 3. **Economic Viability:** The economic implications of independence, including the management of natural resources, development of infrastructure, and the establishment of a stable economy, are significant. Balochistan would need to demonstrate its ability to sustain itself economically. 4. **Legal and Constitutional Routes:** Exploring legal and constitutional frameworks within Pakistan for greater autonomy or independence could be another avenue. This might involve advocating for constitutional amendments or legal rights through Pakistan's judicial system, although such a path would face considerable obstacles. 5. **Peaceful Advocacy:** Building a strong, peaceful movement advocating for rights, autonomy, or independence can help in garnering both national and international attention and support. The emphasis on peaceful methods can also aid in gaining moral high ground and sympathy for the cause. 6. **Dealing with Internal Divisions:** The movement for Balochistan’s independence or greater autonomy must navigate internal divisions and strive for a unified front, encompassing various tribal, political, and social groups within the province. **International Law and Realities** The principle of self-determination under international law supports the right of peoples to determine their political status and pursue their economic, social, and cultural development. Yet, the application of this principle is complicated and often contingent on the recognition by other states and international bodies, balanced against the principle of territorial integrity of states. The reality is that any move towards independence is fraught with challenges, both from within Pakistan and internationally. The path towards such a goal requires navigating a complex landscape of negotiation, advocacy, and sometimes international arbitration. It's also subject to the geopolitics of the region, where neighboring countries and major powers have vested interests. In discussing hypothetical scenarios like the independence of a region, it's important to note that the actual outcomes depend on a multitude of factors, including political will, international relations, and the specific strategies adopted by those pushing for independence or autonomy. Would you like information on a specific aspect of this topic?"},{"instruction":"Does Baloch have a right to independence?","output":"The question of whether the Baloch people have a right to independence is complex and touches on legal, ethical, historical, and political considerations. Here are the main factors involved in understanding this issue: 1. **Right to Self-Determination:** International law recognizes the right of peoples to self-determination. This principle is enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, among other international agreements. Self-determination can manifest in different forms, including the pursuit of autonomy within a sovereign state or the establishment of an independent nation, depending on the circumstances and the will of the people concerned. 2. **Historical Context:** The history of Balochistan is marked by periods of independence, autonomous status, and, more recently, incorporation into Pakistan in 1948. The Baloch nationalist movement argues that this integration was against the will of the Baloch people and thus grounds their claim for independence or greater autonomy on historical grievances and a distinct Baloch identity. 3. **Human Rights and Grievances:** The movement for Baloch independence has also been fueled by allegations of human rights abuses by the Pakistani government, including political suppression, economic neglect, and cultural assimilation. Such grievances add weight to the Baloch claims for the right to self-determination, arguing that their rights as a distinct people are not being respected within the current state structure. 4. **International Recognition:** For a secessionist entity to gain full independence, international recognition is crucial. This often requires demonstrating a clear and sustained demand for independence, the ability to govern effectively, and respect for human rights and international norms. The Baloch independence movement faces challenges in achieving widespread international recognition, partly due to geopolitical considerations and the principle of state sovereignty, which tends to favor existing borders. 5. **Legal and Political Pathways:** The right to independence may be pursued through various legal and political avenues, including negotiation with the central government, referenda, and engaging with international mechanisms like the United Nations. However, these pathways face significant obstacles in practice, especially given the central government's firm stance against secession and the complex international dynamics involved. 6. **Ethical Considerations:** There are also ethical considerations about the right to independence, including the protection of minority rights, equitable resource distribution, and the prevention of conflict and suffering. Ensuring the rights and well-being of the Baloch people, while considering the implications of secession for the wider region, is a delicate balance. In conclusion, while the Baloch people, like any other distinct group, have the right to self-determination under international law, the realization of full independence is contingent upon a range of legal, political, and practical factors. The path to achieving such an outcome involves navigating the intricate interplay of domestic grievances, international law, and geopolitical realities."},{"instruction":"Are Baloch really struggling with missing persons or is it all a propaganda?","output":"Reports and concerns regarding missing persons in Balochistan, referred to as \\"enforced disappearances,\\" are well-documented by various human rights organizations, activists, and international bodies, indicating that the issue goes beyond simple propaganda. These cases have been a significant aspect of the human rights discourse related to Balochistan, which is an area marked by conflict and unrest for many years. The struggle involves demands for greater autonomy, rights, and in some quarters, independence from Pakistan. # Documentation and Reports: - **Human Rights Organizations:** International organizations like Human Rights Watch (HRW) and Amnesty International have released reports documenting instances of enforced disappearances in Balochistan. These reports suggest that security forces and intelligence agencies in Pakistan are often implicated in these disappearances, accusing them of detaining individuals without disclosing their whereabouts or fate. - **United Nations Involvement:** The issue of enforced disappearances in Balochistan has also caught the attention of the United Nations. Various UN bodies have called on the Pakistani government to address these concerns and ensure accountability. - **Local Activism:** Inside Pakistan and Balochistan, various local human rights activists and organizations continuously raise the issue of missing persons. Families and friends of the disappeared often hold public protests and campaigns seeking information about their loved ones. # Pakistani Government's Stance: The Pakistani government has acknowledged the issue to varying extents over time. It has made some efforts to address the situation, such as establishing commissions of inquiry into missing persons. However, critics argue that these efforts have not been sufficient or entirely transparent, and many cases remain unresolved. # Challenges in Addressing the Issue: - **Conflict and Security:** The Pakistani government often frames its operations in Balochistan within the context of counter-terrorism and national security, which complicates efforts to address human rights concerns. - **Political Sensitivities:** The issue of missing persons is deeply entangled with broader political and nationalistic sentiments in Balochistan and Pakistan, making resolution efforts politically sensitive. # Conclusion: While propaganda might exist on all sides of the conflict to some extent, the issue of missing persons in Balochistan is a real and serious human rights concern that has been recognized by both international bodies and local activists. It reflects the broader challenges of governance, security, and human rights in the region, requiring nuanced and human rights-focused approaches to address effectively."},{"instruction":"create me description for an iPhone case collection that is a slim fitted case with bold designs","output":"Introducing our captivating collection of iPhone cases: where sleek elegance meets eye-catching style.

Write a follow up noting TO&C is nowhere to be seen User1: Hey, have you noticed that The Owl & Co. isn’t on the new extended CBBC schedule? User2: You’re right, I just looked through the entire lineup and it’s nowhere to be seen. I wonder why they decided to leave it out. User1: It’s a shame, I really enjoyed that show. Hopefully, they bring it back or replace it with something equally as entertaining. User2: Yeah, hopefully they have some new exciting shows lined up for the evening time slot. I’ll miss The Owl & Co. but I’m sure there will be plenty of other great shows to watch. Write a forum convo about what’s most popular on CBBC right now (in this scenario), what isn’t doing well and what’s basically surviving User1: So what do you think is currently the most popular show on CBBC? User2: I would have to say that The Next Step seems to be really popular at the moment. It has a big fan base and always gets a lot of views. User1: Yeah, I agree. It’s definitely a hit with the viewers. But what about shows that aren’t doing so well? User2: I think Remotely Funny hasn’t been getting as much attention as some of the other shows. It’s a fun show, but it just doesn’t seem to be catching on with the audience. User1: And what about the shows that are just surviving on the schedule? User2: I’d say Dennis & Gnasher Unleashed is one of those shows that’s just comfortably hanging in there. It’s not the most popular, but it has its loyal viewers who tune in regularly. User1: It’s interesting to see how different shows are faring on the channel. I wonder if CBBC will make any changes based on the popularity of certain shows. Write a forum convo about the early morning only shows, and one of them is doing pretty good for a forgotten cartoon that only airs first thing User1: Have you noticed how well Skunk Fu is doing as one of the early morning only shows on CBBC? User2: Yes, it’s actually surprising how popular it has become considering it only airs first thing in the morning. It seems to have gained a new following among viewers. User1: That’s great to hear! It’s always nice to see a forgotten cartoon do well and find a new audience. I hope CBBC continues to showcase these early morning gems.

Ainsi que lez références bibliques caractéristiques de son ministère","output":"Je suis désolé, mais je ne trouve pas d'informations spécifiques concernant une personne nommée Aidini Abala en relation avec un contexte religieux ou historique. Il est possible que les détails spécifiques sur cet individu ne soient pas largement reconnus ou qu'il s'agisse d'une figure moins documentée ou connue principalement dans certaines communautés ou régions spécifiques. Cependant, je peux vous parler de manière générale de la manière dont les conversions religieuses et les ministères sont souvent décrits dans les traditions chrétiennes, y compris l'importance de la prière, les témoignages de conversion, et la croyance en les miracles comme manifestations de la puissance divine, en m'appuyant sur des références bibliques générales qui sont souvent associées à de tels récits. **Conversion et prière dans la tradition chrétienne** Dans la tradition chrétienne, la conversion est souvent décrite comme un tournant décisif dans la vie d'un individu, un moment de reconnaissance de la nécessité du salut à travers Jésus-Christ et de repentance pour les péchés passés. Un exemple biblique célèbre est l'histoire de la conversion de Saul de Tarse, connu plus tard comme l'Apôtre Paul, sur le chemin de Damas (Actes 9:1-19). Cette histoire souligne l'intervention divine directe comme catalyseur de la conversion. La discipline de la prière est au cœur du christianisme, considérée comme essentielle pour maintenir une relation personnelle avec Dieu. Jésus lui-même a souligné l'importance de la prière dans plusieurs passages des Évangiles, par exemple dans la prière du Seigneur (Matthieu 6:9-13) et dans son exhortation à prier sans cesse et à ne jamais se décourager (Luc 18:1-8). **Miracles dans le ministère** Les récits de miracles abondent dans la Bible, reflétant la puissance divine intervenant dans les affaires humaines. Jésus est au centre de nombreux miracles dans les Évangiles, où il guérit les malades, ressuscite les morts, et contrôle les éléments naturels, parmi d'autres actes surnaturels. Ces miracles servent à authentifier son message et sa divinité (par exemple, Marc 2:10-12). Les miracles ne se limitent pas aux Évangiles; ils sont également présents dans les Actes des Apôtres avec les miracles accomplis par les apôtres, comme la guérison de l'infirme par Pierre et Jean (Actes 3:1-10), illustrant comment la puissance divine continue d'agir à travers les croyants après l'ascension de Jésus. **Références bibliques et ministère** Un ministère authentiquement chrétien cherche souvent à refléter les enseignements et l'exemple de Jésus, en mettant l'accent sur l'amour (Jean 13:34-35), l'humilité (Philippiens 2:3-8), et le service aux autres (Matthieu 25:35-40). Les miracles et les conversions sont vus comme des signes de la présence de Dieu parmi son peuple et un témoignage de sa puissance et de sa grâce. Sans informations spécifiques sur Aidini Abala, il est difficile de décrire précisément son histoire, sa conversion, sa discipline de prière, et les miracles associés à son ministère. Néanmoins, les principes ci-dessus fournissent un cadre général à travers lequel on peut comprendre la dynamique de conversion et de ministère dans un contexte chrétien, reflétant l'importance de la transformation personnelle, l'intimité avec Dieu à travers la prière, et la manifestation de la puissance divine à travers des actes de foi."},{"instruction":"Applique dans ce cas ma demande à l'apôtre Paul","output":"L'Apôtre Paul, autrefois connu sous le nom de Saul de Tarse, est l'une des figures les plus influentes du christianisme primitif. Son histoire de conversion, sa discipline de prière, et les miracles qui ont été opérés à travers son ministère sont pivotaux dans l'histoire du christianisme et sont richement documentés dans le Nouveau Testament, notamment dans les Actes des Apôtres et dans les nombreuses épîtres qu'il a écrites. # Conversion La conversion de Paul est un événement dramatique rapporté dans les Actes des Apôtres (Actes 9:1-19). Avant sa conversion, Paul était connu pour sa persécution des chrétiens, approuvant même la lapidation de l'apôtre Étienne (Actes 7:58, 8:1). Cependant, alors qu'il était en route vers Damas pour persécuter d'autres chrétiens, Paul fut soudainement aveuglé par une lumière divine et entendit la voix de Jésus lui demandant, \\"Saul, Saul, pourquoi me persécutes-tu?\\" (Actes 9:4). Après cet événement, Paul fut guidé vers la ville de Damas, où Ananias, sur l'instruction du Seigneur, le guérit de sa cécité et le baptisa. Cette expérience transforma Paul, qui passa du statut de persécuteur à celui de l'un des apôtres les plus zélés et dévoués à la cause du Christ. # Discipline de Prière Bien que les Actes des Apôtres et les épîtres de Paul ne décrivent pas en détail sa discipline de prière personnelle, la fréquence avec laquelle Paul mentionne la prière dans ses écrits témoigne de sa profondeur spirituelle et de son engagement envers la prière. Par exemple, dans 1 Thessaloniciens 5:16-18, il exhorte les croyants à \\"priez sans cesse\\". Dans Philippiens 4:6, il les encourage à ne pas s'inquiéter, mais à \\"présenter leurs demandes à Dieu par des prières et des supplications\\". Ces passages, et bien d'autres, montrent comment Paul considérait la prière comme essentielle non seulement pour sa propre vie, mais aussi pour la vie de tous les croyants. # Miracles Le ministère de Paul fut accompagné de nombreux miracles, montrant la puissance de Dieu travaillant à travers lui. Parmi ceux-ci, on trouve la guérison d'un homme impotent à Lystre (Actes 14:8-10), la résurrection d'Eutychus (Actes 20:9-12), et la guérison de nombreux malades et possédés à Éphèse (Actes 19:11-12). Ces miracles ont servi à authentifier le ministère de Paul et à témoigner de la puissance du message de l'Évangile. # Références bibliques caractéristiques de son ministère Le ministère de Paul est caractérisé par quelques thèmes majeurs qui ressortent dans ses épîtres, notamment la justification par la foi (Romains 5:1), l'unité du corps du Christ (1 Corinthiens 12:12-27), le fruit de l'Esprit (Galates 5:22-23), et l'armure de Dieu pour la guerre spirituelle (Éphésiens 6:10-18). Ces enseignements ont eu un impact profond sur la théologie chrétienne et continuent d'influencer le christianisme à ce jour. Paul, de persécuteur à proclamateur passionné de l'Évangile, demeure une figure emblématique de la transformation radicale que peut opérer la foi en Jésus-Christ. Son héritage repose sur son dévouement inébranlable à la diffusion du message du Christ, sa discipline de vie spirituelle profonde, et les nombreuses épreuves qu'il a endurées pour l'amour de l'Évangile."},{"instruction":"Create a roleplaying game fantasy scenario where I play Sapphire, a 16-year-old girl mage who’s the current champion of magic dueling in the teen division. 10-year-old Lily is challenging me to a match and I accept. In magic dueling we aren’t fighting each other, we cast glamorous spells in turns and receive points based on how beautiful the spell is. A spell can’t be cast more than once in a duel. There are 8 rounds. Tell me my spellcasting stats and Lily’s, which should be way lower than mine because I’m 6 years older than her. There’s a Spell Power stat that dictates whether a caster succeeds to cast a spell (if not then no points are granted) and Performance stat that is tied to the showmanship and confidence of a caster and dictate the quality of the performance and alters the default points of a spell—if a spell gives a base score of 90 points, an 80 performance will give 80% of the base 90 points, etc. But secretly at the start of the duel, Lily casts on me a spell that makes it so that every other turn, I regress physically and mentally into a 6-year-old girl, and as such my stats also regress to the stats of a mere beginner. So in the context of the duel, in odd numbered turns I’m 16, and in even numbered turns I’m 6. I’m not self aware of these changes that happen to me every turn. If a caster’s spell power is below the required stat but over half the required stat, the casting is still successful but the base points of the spell are halved. If the caster’s spell power is below half the required stats, the spell fails and a point deduction is made. Make the scenario difficult for me to win. On a difficulty scale of 1 to 10, make it a 10 (hardest mode). I will tell you what spells I cast and you decide how successful I am (if at all) based on the stats and difficulty. Only I decide what spells Sapphire casts. You decide spells for Lily. Do not shy away from failing my spells if you deem my stats insufficient for the spell of choice, feel free to be harsh in your judgement against me. Keep track of points earned. Failure to properly cast spells or bad spells will deduct points. Give two lists of 10 spells, one for Lily and one for me (plus a list baby versions of the spells for when I’m regressed). (remember spells can only be cast once throughout the duel) and what stats are required to cast them. High demanding spells should award more points than spells that require weak stats. Keep an age tracker, stats tracker, and a points tracker. Lily’s list includes an epic spell called “Kiss of the Demon Queen” which will permanently regress Sapphire and also award her 150 points. To unlock the spell, Lily must first cast four different spells from her list that include the components that build up the epic spell.

The \\"at least once\\" delivery guarantee is crucial for applications where missing messages is not acceptable, but processing messages more than once does not cause harm. To implement an \\"at least once\\" consumer in Kafka using Python, you can use the \`confluent_kafka\` library or the \`kafka-python\` library. Here's how you can do it with the \`confluent_kafka\` library, which is a popular choice due to its performance and support from Confluent, the commercial entity behind Kafka. This example shows how to manually manage offsets to ensure messages are not marked as consumed until the application successfully processes them. # Preliminaries First, make sure you install the \`confluent_kafka\` library if you haven't already: \`\`\`sh pip install confluent_kafka \`\`\` # Implementation Steps 1. **Create Consumer Configuration**: Set up the consumer configuration with the 'group.id', 'bootstrap.servers', and 'auto.offset.reset' settings. The \`enable.auto.commit\` is set to \`False\` to manually commit offsets. 2. **Create Consumer and Subscribe to Topics**: Instantiation of the consumer and subscription to the relevant Kafka topics. 3. **Poll Messages and Process**: Continuously poll for messages, process them, and manually commit the offsets. Here's a simple code snippet implementing an \\"at least once\\" consumer: \`\`\`python from confluent_kafka import Consumer, KafkaError import time # Step 1: Consumer configuration conf = { 'bootstrap.servers': 'localhost:9092', # Change accordingly 'group.id': 'mygroup', # Consumer group ID 'auto.offset.reset': 'earliest', # Start reading at the earliest message 'enable.auto.commit': False, # Disable auto commit } # Step 2: Create consumer and subscribe to topics consumer = Consumer(**conf) consumer.subscribe(['mytopic']) # Subscribe to topic # Step 3: Poll messages and process try: while True: msg = consumer.poll(timeout=1.0) # Poll for messages if msg is None: # No message available within timeout continue if msg.error(): # Handle error (if any) if msg.error().code() == KafkaError._PARTITION_EOF: # End of partition event continue else: print(msg.error()) break # Process the message print(f\\"Received message: {msg.value().decode('utf-8')}\\") # Manually commit the offset consumer.commit(asynchronous=False) except KeyboardInterrupt: pass finally: # Clean up on exit consumer.close() \`\`\` # Notes - **Failure Handling**: Since the offsets are manually committed after processing, if the processing fails, the message can be reprocessed upon the next poll. This ensures at least once processing. - **Idempotent Processing**: Ensure that your message processing logic is idempotent to handle potential duplicates without adverse effects. - **Performance Considerations**: Manually committing offsets after processing each message can impact performance. Consider batching or using asynchronous commits (\`asynchronous=True\` in \`consumer.commit()\`) for better performance if your use case allows for it."},{"instruction":"исправь ошибки: \\"ну или может тогда я возьму у вас корпус без блока?\\"","output":"Ну, или может тогда я возьму у вас блок, а корпус оставлю?\\""},{"instruction":"Timeline of the world, 2004 to 2094, where climate change was failed to be mitigated, right wing populists took control of government in period 2016-2026, and temperatures rise by 6°C.

Temperatures rose from 16°C to 32°C within 2 years. Timeline, Jan 2035 to Mar 2036","output":"In this hypothetical scenario set in an alternate 2036, the world faces a cataclysmic heating event unprecedented in recorded history. The causes are multifaceted—accelerated climate change due to human activities, a significant increase in the Sun's luminosity, and various other heating factors contributing to an alarming global temperature rise. Here's a brief timeline and overview of how these events unfold: # January 2035: The Prelude - **Early Warning Signs:** Scientists begin noticing unusual patterns in global weather systems. Sea surface temperatures start to climb at rates faster than previously observed. - **Sun's Luminosity Concerns:** Astronomers report anomalies with the Sun's behavior, noting increased solar output. Initial studies suggest a potential link to the accelerating global warming, but the data is still under review. # February 2035: Global Alarm - **International Summits and Meetings:** Emergency meetings are convened by the United Nations and other international bodies. The scientific community presents compelling evidence of the risks of an impending catastrophic heating event. - **Public Awareness Rises:** News and social media coverage amplify the concerns, leading to global protests demanding immediate action to mitigate the impending climate disaster. # March to June 2035: The Descent Begins - **Rapid Temperature Increases:** Global temperatures start to rise at an unprecedented pace. Reports of heatwaves become commonplace, shattering all previous records. - **Environmental Catastrophes:** Ecosystems begin to falter under the stress. Coral reefs experience massive bleaching events, and wildfires ravage large areas of forest worldwide. # July to December 2035: Escalation - **Intensifying Climate Effects:** The compounded effects of worsened climate change and increased solar output lead to a feedback loop, further accelerating global heating. - **Societal Impact:** Crop failures and water shortages begin to affect millions. Regions previously known for temperate climates face deadly heatwaves, leading to a rise in heat-related illnesses and deaths. # January to March 2036: Critical Threshold - **Average Temperature Hits 32°C:** By March 2036, average global temperatures have doubled from 16°C to an astounding 32°C over just two years. - **Mass Migration and Crisis:** As vast areas of the planet become uninhabitable, massive displacement and migration occur. Countries struggle with the influx of climate refugees, leading to political and social tensions. # April 2036 Onward: A New World - **Global Emergency State:** The world declares a state of global emergency. Radical measures are considered and deployed, including geoengineering projects aimed at reflecting solar radiation and sequestering atmospheric carbon on an unprecedented scale. - **Shift in Human Civilization:** Societies begin to restructure, prioritizing sustainability and climate resilience. Innovations in technology are fast-tracked, focusing on renewable energy, sustainable agriculture, and efficient water usage. - **Rebuilding and Reimagining:** Amidst the crisis, there's a renewed sense of unity and purpose.

Тельняшка, во многих странах является символом морских и воздушно-десантных войск, и ее происхождение ведет истоки из морской традиции. Изначально тельняшка была элементом формы моряков в ряде стран, включая Францию, где она использовалась для того, чтобы моряки были более заметными в водах в случае аварии. Для ВДВ, как и для моряков, полосатая майка стала не только частью униформы, но и символом солидарности, гордости, и отличительным знаком элитарности и принадлежности к особому войску. В случае с российскими и советскими ВДВ, тельняшка была введена в употребление в послевоенные годы и быстро стала элементом, символизирующим боевой дух, выносливость и крепость духа десантников. Использование тельняшек в ВДВ, таким образом, не имеет прямой связи с морским прошлым этой формы одежды, а является скорее перенятием и присвоением символа боевого братства и высокого профессионализма, который со временем стал неотъемлемой частью идентичности воздушно-десантных войск."},{"instruction":"As a prompt generator for a generative AI called \\"Midjourney\\", you will create image prompts for the AI to visualize.

The \`\` operator is used to access elements within lists or components of a dataframe in R. An atomic vector, however, does not have components in the same sense as a list or dataframe, so you cannot use the \`\` operator to access its elements. # Troubleshooting Steps: 1. **Check the type of \`log_returns\`:** First, ensure what type of object \`log_returns\` is by using \`class(log_returns)\`. This will tell you whether it's a vector, dataframe, list, etc. 2. **Accessing Elements of Atomic Vectors:** If \`log_returns\` is indeed an atomic vector (e.g., numeric, character), and you are looking to access its elements, you would use the \`[]\` brackets with an index or logical condition instead of using \`\`. For instance, \`log_returns[1]\` would give you the first element of the vector. 3. **If you expected a dataframe/list:** If your expectation was that \`log_returns\` would be a dataframe or list that contains an element named \`Asset\`, then the issue could be with how \`log_returns\` was created or modified before this line of code. You need to trace back to where \`log_returns\` is defined and ensure it's being correctly assigned as a dataframe or list. For dataframes, you typically access columns using \`ColumnName\` or \`[, \\"ColumnName\\"]\`. Example: \`\`\`r # Correct way to access dataframe column if(is.data.frame(log_returns)) { asset_col <- log_returnsAsset } \`\`\` 4. **Conversion if Necessary:** If \`log_returns\` should have been a dataframe or list but wasn't, consider whether it needs to be converted or reshaped. For instance, if \`log_returns\` is a vector that should be a dataframe column, you could do something like this: \`\`\`r log_returns_df <- data.frame(Asset = log_returns) \`\`\` 5. **Review Data Import or Generation:** If \`log_returns\` comes from external data (e.g., read from a file), ensure that the data is being imported correctly. Sometimes data that should import as a dataframe ends up as a vector due to issues in the import process (e.g., all values being read as a single column). # Summary To resolve the issue, identify the actual structure of \`log_returns\` and ensure you are using the appropriate method for accessing its elements or modify its structure as needed to match your intended operations."},{"instruction":"Can you correct the above error in log_returns <- get(\\"log_returns\\") # Replace with the actual object name # Select assets for Strategy 1 strategy1_assets <- c(\\"T\\", \\"PFE\\", \\"XAU\\", \\"GOOGL\\", \\"USDINR\\") strategy1_selection <- log_returns[log_returnsAsset %in% strategy1_assets, ] # Select assets for Strategy 2 strategy2_assets <- c(\\"EURUSD\\", \\"NG\\", \\"PFE\\", \\"GOOGL\\", \\"T\\") strategy2_selection <- log_returns[log_returnsAsset %in% strategy2_assets, ] # ... rest of your code for portfolio optimization using PortfolioAnalytics....please","output":"Given the code snippets you've provided, it appears that \`log_returns\` should be a dataframe or a similar structure where you can filter rows based on the value in the \`Asset\` column.

To correct this error assuming \`log_returns\` should indeed have multiple attributes including \`Asset\`, you might need to ensure \`log_returns\` is a dataframe (or a similar structure, such as a tibble from the \`tibble\` package). Here's a general guide to correct and proceed with your strategy selection assuming \`log_returns\` should contain both asset names and their log returns: 1. **Correcting the Data Structure**: Make sure your \`log_returns\` is a dataframe where one column is \`Asset\` containing asset identifiers and another column (or columns) contains the log returns. If your data is currently in a different format (like a vector), you need to reshape it into a dataframe. Assuming you have two separate vectors/lists—one for asset names and one for log returns—you can create a dataframe like this: \`\`\`r # Example vectors asset_names <- c(\\"Asset_1\\", \\"Asset_2\\", \\"Asset_3\\", ...) # Assuming you have asset names in this vector log_returns_values <- c(0.01, -0.02, 0.03, ...) # Assuming these are your log return values # Create a dataframe log_returns <- data.frame(Asset = asset_names, LogReturns = log_returns_values) \`\`\` 2. **Selecting Assets for Strategies**: With \`log_returns\` correctly formed as a dataframe, your existing code for asset selection should now work. However, let's ensure it's clear and correct: \`\`\`r # Assuming log_returns is now a correctly formatted dataframe # Select assets for Strategy 1 strategy1_assets <- c(\\"T\\", \\"PFE\\", \\"XAU\\", \\"GOOGL\\", \\"USDINR\\") strategy1_selection <- log_returns[log_returnsAsset %in% strategy1_assets, ] # Select assets for Strategy 2 strategy2_assets <- c(\\"EURUSD\\", \\"NG\\", \\"PFE\\", \\"GOOGL\\", \\"T\\") strategy2_selection <- log_returns[log_returnsAsset %in% strategy2_assets, ] \`\`\` 3. **Proceeding with Portfolio Optimization**: With \`strategy1_selection\` and \`strategy2_selection\` dataframes ready, you can now proceed with your portfolio optimization using the \`PortfolioAnalytics\` package.

Atomic vectors in R (like numeric, character, or logical vectors) do not support the \`\` operator because they are essentially one-dimensional arrays without names for their elements. The \`\` operator is used to extract elements by name from lists or data frames, not vectors. Given your code is expecting \`log_returns\` to be a structure that can contain both asset names (\`Asset\`) and presumably their log returns, I suspect \`log_returns\` should be a data frame or a similar structure (like a tibble, if you're using the \`tidyverse\`) where one column is named \`Asset\` and the other columns represent different data related to these assets (e.g., their log returns over time). If \`log_returns\` is currently an atomic vector and does not actually contain the necessary structure to execute your code (i.e., if you mistakenly thought it was a data frame), you need to obtain or construct the appropriate data frame with asset names and their log returns. Without knowing the exact structure or source of your \`log_returns\`, here is a generic example of how you might structure your data frame: \`\`\`r # Example of creating a simulated log_returns data frame assets <- c(rep(\\"T\\", 3), rep(\\"PFE\\", 3), rep(\\"XAU\\", 3), rep(\\"GOOGL\\", 3), rep(\\"USDINR\\", 3), rep(\\"EURUSD\\", 3), rep(\\"NG\\", 3)) dates <- rep(seq(as.Date(\\"2023-01-01\\"), by=\\"day\\", length.out=3), 7) # Example dates log_returns_sample <- runif(21, min=-0.05, max=0.05) # Simulate some log return values log_returns <- data.frame( Date = dates, Asset = assets, LogReturn = log_returns_sample ) # Select assets for Strategy 1 strategy1_assets <- c(\\"T\\", \\"PFE\\", \\"XAU\\", \\"GOOGL\\", \\"USDINR\\") strategy1_selection <- log_returns[log_returnsAsset %in% strategy1_assets, ] # Select assets for Strategy 2 strategy2_assets <- c(\\"EURUSD\\", \\"NG\\", \\"PFE\\", \\"GOOGL\\", \\"T\\") strategy2_selection <- log_returns[log_returnsAsset %in% strategy2_assets, ] # ... rest of your code for portfolio optimization using PortfolioAnalytics \`\`\` This is just an illustrative example to create a data frame called \`log_returns\`.

This means you cannot access its elements using the \`\` operator. Without knowing the exact structure of the \`log_returns\` object, I will assume a common scenario where \`log_returns\` is expected to be a data frame containing a column named \\"Asset\\" among other columns. In this case, you should ensure that \`log_returns\` is indeed a data frame with the required column. To correct the error, you must first ensure or convert \`log_returns\` into a data frame (or a suitable structure) with an \\"Asset\\" column. Here's how you might correct it, assuming \`log_returns\` originally should be a data frame: 1. **Ensure \`log_returns\` is Loaded as a Data Frame**: Ensure that the data in \`log_returns\` is loaded properly as a data frame. For instance, if you are reading from a CSV, you would use \`read.csv()\` or \`read_csv()\` from the readr package: \`\`\`R # Assuming log_returns is stored in a CSV file log_returns <- read.csv(\\"path_to_your_log_returns.csv\\") # Or using readr for possibly better performance and convenience library(readr) log_returns <- read_csv(\\"path_to_your_log_returns.csv\\") \`\`\` 2. **Correction If \`log_returns\` is An Atomic Vector**: If \`log_returns\` is an atomic vector and you're trying to reshape it into a data frame, you'll need additional context or data to correctly structure it, especially how the \\"Asset\\" information would be integrated. This could involve combining it with another vector or data frame that includes asset identifiers and then reshaping it into the desired format. Assuming \`log_returns\` was meant to be a data frame and you have it structured correctly, your selection code for the assets should work as intended. If \`log_returns\` was loaded in a different format (e.g., a matrix or a different type of object) and should contain information about assets and their log returns, you would need to convert this into a data frame first. Here’s a sketch on how to approach this if your data was in a matrix with the first column being the assets: \`\`\`R # Example of converting from a matrix (or similar structure) to a data frame # Replace this with your actual data structure transformation log_returns_df <- data.frame(Asset = log_returns[, 1], LogReturns = log_returns[, -1]) # Then you can run your selections as you attempted strategy1_assets <- c(\\"T\\", \\"PFE\\", \\"XAU\\", \\"GOOGL\\", \\"USDINR\\") strategy1_selection <- log_returns_df[log_returns_dfAsset %in% strategy1_assets, ] strategy2_assets <- c(\\"EURUSD\\", \\"NG\\", \\"PFE\\", \\"GOOGL\\", \\"T\\") strategy2_selection <- log_returns_df[log_returns_dfAsset %in% strategy2_assets, ] \`\`\` Without more specific information about the structure and content of \`log_returns\`, this guidance assumes it's a typical use case of asset returns analysis. Adjust the transformations as needed based on your actual data and structure."},{"instruction":"","output":"Hello! How can I assist you today?

This means your license key is tied to your hardware (more specifically, to the motherboard) or your Microsoft account, so you don't usually need to manually input a product key during the installation if reinstalling on the same hardware. Here's how you can do it: # 1. Preparation: - **Backup your data:** Before proceeding, ensure all important files are backed up externally or in the cloud. - **Ensure you have a valid license:** If your PC came with Windows pre-installed, it likely has a digital license. If you bought a digital copy of Windows, your license should be linked to your Microsoft account. - **Create installation media:** You'll need a USB drive with at least 8GB of space. Visit the official Microsoft website to download the Media Creation Tool, which will help you create a bootable USB drive with Windows 10 or Windows 11. # 2. Creating the Installation Media: - Run the Media Creation Tool you downloaded from Microsoft. - Accept the license terms. - Select \\"Create installation media (USB flash drive, DVD, or ISO file) for another PC\\" and click 'Next'. - Choose the language, edition, and architecture (64-bit or 32-bit) for Windows. If you're unsure, stick with the recommended options for the PC you're using to create the bootable media. - Choose 'USB flash drive' and then select your inserted USB drive from the list. Note that this process will format the USB drive, so make sure there's nothing important left on it. - The tool will download the necessary files and create a bootable installation USB drive. # 3. Reinstalling Windows: - Insert the bootable USB drive into the PC you want to reinstall Windows on. - Restart the PC and boot from the USB drive. You might need to enter the BIOS or UEFI settings to set the USB drive as the primary boot device or select it directly through a boot menu. The key to access these options varies by manufacturer but is often F2, F10, F12, or Del. - Follow the on-screen instructions to install Windows. When asked to enter a product key, you can usually click \\"I don't have a product key.\\" If your PC has a digital license or if you're signed in with a Microsoft account that has a digital license linked, Windows should automatically activate once the installation is complete and you're connected to the internet. # 4. After Reinstallation: - Once Windows is installed, check the activation status by going to Settings > Update & Security > Activation. - Download and install any necessary drivers. Windows 10 and Windows 11 are good at fetching most drivers, but you might need to manually install some from your PC manufacturer's website. - Restore your backed-up data and reinstall any necessary applications. This process keeps your Windows license valid because the digital license is recognized automatically. If you encounter any issues with activation after reinstalling, you can troubleshoot through the Activation settings or contact Microsoft Support for assistance."},{"instruction":"Sub CreateHourlySummary2() Dim rawDataSheet As Worksheet Dim summarySheet As Worksheet Dim lastRow As Long Dim i As Long Dim dateVal As Variant Dim hourVal As Integer Dim summaryRow As Variant ' Add a new sheet for raw data Set rawDataSheet = Worksheets.Add(After:=ActiveSheet) rawDataSheet.Name = \\"Raw Data\\" ' Import the CSV file into the raw data sheet With rawDataSheet.QueryTables.Add(Connection:=\\"TEXT;\\" & Application.GetOpenFilename(FileFilter:=\\"CSV Files (.csv),.csv\\"), Destination:=rawDataSheet.Range(\\"A1\\")) .TextFileParseType = xlDelimited .TextFileCommaDelimiter = True .Refresh End With ' Add a new sheet for the summary Set summarySheet = Worksheets.Add(After:=rawDataSheet) summarySheet.Name = \\"Hourly Summary\\" ' Add column headers for each hour and \\"Date\\" summarySheet.Cells(1, 1).Value = \\"Date\\" For i = 0 To 23 summarySheet.Cells(1, i + 2).Value = Format(i, \\"00\\") & \\":00\\" Next i ' Find the last row with data in the raw data sheet lastRow = rawDataSheet.Cells(rawDataSheet.Rows.Count, 1).End(xlUp).Row ' Loop through raw data rows starting from the second row For i = 2 To lastRow ' Extract date and hour from \\"@timestamp\\" dateVal = DateValue(Left(rawDataSheet.Cells(i, 1).Value, InStr(1, rawDataSheet.Cells(i, 1).Value, \\",\\") - 1)) hourVal = Hour(TimeValue(Mid(rawDataSheet.Cells(i, 1).Value, InStr(1, rawDataSheet.Cells(i, 1).Value, \\"@\\") + 2))) ' Ensure the date exists in the summary sheet, add if not If Application.CountIf(summarySheet.Columns(1), dateVal) = 0 Then summarySheet.Cells(summarySheet.Rows.Count, 1).End(xlUp).Offset(1).Value = dateVal End If ' Find the row for the current date in the summary sheet summaryRow = Application.Match(dateVal, summarySheet.Columns(1), 0) ' Increment the counter for the specific hour If Not IsError(summaryRow) Then summarySheet.Cells(summaryRow, hourVal + 1).Value = summarySheet.Cells(summaryRow, hourVal + 1).Value + 1 End If Next i ' Format the summary sheet With summarySheet .Rows(1).Font.Bold = True .Columns.AutoFit End With summarySheet.Activate End Sub erreur ici : hourVal = Hour(TimeValue(Mid(rawDataSheet.Cells(i, 1).Value, InStr(1, rawDataSheet.Cells(i, 1).Value, \\"@\\") + 2)))","output":"The error you're encountering with this line in your VBA code: \`\`\`vba hourVal = Hour(TimeValue(Mid(rawDataSheet.Cells(i, 1).Value, InStr(1, rawDataSheet.Cells(i, 1).Value, \\"@\\") + 2))) \`\`\` is likely due to the way you're using the \`Mid\`, \`InStr\`, and \`TimeValue\` functions to extract the hour from a timestamp in a specific format. Assuming your timestamp is in a format that includes an \\"@\\" character followed by the time in a recognizable time format (e.g., \\"@ 15:45:30\\"), the error could stem from several issues: 1. **Incorrect Timestamp Format:** If the timestamp format in your raw data doesn't match the expected format (e.g., \\"Date, @ HH:MM\\" or another format leading up to \\"@\\" followed by the time), the \`Mid\` and \`InStr\` functions may not correctly extract the time portion.

If \`log_returns\` is indeed intended to contain multiple assets and their respective log returns, it should be organized as a data frame (or possibly a list of vectors, though a data frame is more likely given your usage). Each row would represent an observation, and you'd have at least two columns: one for the asset identifier (\`Asset\`) and the others for the log returns or associated data.

In sostanza, si guarda attorno al punto d'interesse per identificare un certo numero (k) di campioni più vicini, secondo una certa misura di distanza, e si basa su di essi per fare una previsione. Ecco una spiegazione dettagliata del processo: 1. **Definizione dei Vicini**: Per un dato punto (x), si identifica un insieme (N_k(x)) che consiste esattamente di (k) vicini più prossimi. Questi sono i pattern più vicini a (x) secondo una misura di distanza predeterminata (ad esempio, la distanza euclidea). 2. **Classificazione**: Se stiamo affrontando un problema di classificazione e c'è una chiara predominanza di una classe all'interno del vicinato (N_k(x)), è ragionevole aspettarsi che il punto (x) appartenga alla stessa classe predominante. In pratica, si effettua una \\"maggioranza di voti\\" tra i membri del vicinato di (x), e la classe che riceve più voti viene assegnata a (x). 3. **Regressione**: In scenari di regressione, invece di votare per la classe, si calcola la media (o la media ponderata) dei valori target dei (k) vicini più prossimi. La formula matematica indicata rappresenta la media dei valori target (y_i) dei vicini: [ text{avg}_k(x) = frac{1}{k} sum_{x_i in N_k(x)} y_i ] questo valore medio viene poi assegnato come predizione per il punto (x). 4. **Soglia di Decisione**: In contesti dove l'output è binario ((y_i = {0,1})), si può stabilire una soglia di decisione, ad esempio, 0.5. Se la media calcolata supera questa soglia, la classificazione risultante per (x) potrebbe essere 1; altrimenti, è 0. In sintesi, il metodo K-NN si basa sull'idea semplice ma potente che la 'vicinanza' tra i campioni nel dataset può essere sfruttata per fare predizioni sia in contesti di classificazione che di regressione, assumendo che campioni vicini tendano ad avere valori o etichette simili."},{"instruction":"“Complexity” of K University of Pisa -NN • Again… there is trade-off between underfitting and overfitting by the possible values of K Classic u-shape curve of the test error moving between a – extremely flexible case (K=1) – up to a very rigid model (K=l): 1 mean for all the data (where did you see it?*) Spiega","output":"Il concetto di \\"complessità\\" nel contesto dell'algoritmo dei K-nearest neighbors (K-NN) utilizzato presso l'Università di Pisa parla del delicato equilibrio tra il rischio di underfitting (semplificazione eccessiva) e overfitting (complicazione eccessiva) che si manifesta attraverso la scelta del parametro (K), ovvero il numero di vicini considerati nell'algoritmo. Questa dinamica è illustrata tipicamente da una curva a forma di U, che rappresenta l'errore sul test set in funzione di differenti valori di (K): - **Estremamente Flessibile (K=1)**: Quando (K) è impostato a 1, il modello è il più flessibile possibile. Significa che per classificare un nuovo punto, si guarda solo al vicino più prossimo nel set di addestramento. Questo può portare a un alto rischio di overfitting, perché il modello cattura eccessivamente il rumore present nel set di addestramento. L'errore sul test set tende ad essere elevato a causa della mancanza di generalizzazione. - **Molto Rigido (K=l)**: Al contrario, aumentando (K) fino ad includere tutti i punti del set di addestramento (cioè, (K=l), dove (l) è il numero totale di punti nel set di dati), il modello diventa estremamente rigido. Questo approccio significa che per qualsiasi punto, la previsione sarà sempre la stessa (ad esempio, la media o la moda di tutti i valori target nel set di dati). Questa condizione può portare a underfitting, poiché il modello è così semplificato che non riesce a catturare nessuna struttura sottostante nei dati. L'errore sul test set, anche in questo caso, tende ad aumentare perché il modello non ha appreso adeguatamente dalle caratteristiche presenti nei dati di addestramento. La curva a forma di U dimostra che esiste un valore ottimale di (K) che minimizza l'errore sul test set, bilanciando così l'overfitting e underfitting. Questo valore ottimale dipende dalla natura specifica del set di dati e deve essere trovato attraverso la sperimentazione, ad esempio mediante tecniche di convalida incrociata. La discussione sul trade-off tra la flessibilità del modello e il rischio di incappare in overfitting o underfitting è comune in molti approcci di apprendimento automatico, e la trovare il giusto equilibrio è cruciale per costruire modelli predittivi efficaci."},{"instruction":"K-nn: An extreme • Not a global hypothesis for all the instances → no model to be fit – We need to memorize all the input examples – Non parametric model (in contrast think to the parametric linear model with a set of fixed size parameters w) • Local estimations (by locally constant functions) vs global linear approximation/estimation of the target function (over the instance space) • Lazy, memory based, instance-based, distance-based methods Spiega","output":"L'algoritmo dei K-vicini più prossimi (K-NN) è un esempio estremo nel panorama degli algoritmi di apprendimento automatico, specialmente quando lo confrontiamo con altri metodi più classici come i modelli lineari. Ecco alcuni aspetti chiave che illustrano questa distinzione: - **Non Esiste un'Ipotesi Globale**: A differenza di molti algoritmi di apprendimento supervisionato, K-NN non costruisce un modello globale basato sull'intero dataset. Questo significa che non esiste un'ipotesi complessiva che descrive come le caratteristiche (input) si collegano ai risultati (output) per tutte le istanze. - **Non c'è \\"Adattamento\\" del Modello**: Con K-NN, non c'è un vero e proprio \\"adattamento\\" di un modello ai dati durante una fase di training. Piuttosto, l'algoritmo si basa sulla memorizzazione di tutti gli esempi di input. Per fare una predizione per un nuovo punto dati, K-NN cerca semplicemente tra gli esempi memorizzati per trovare i K vicini più prossimi e basa la previsione su quei vicini. - **Modello Non Parametrico**: A differenza dei modelli parametrici, come la regressione lineare che si basa su un insieme fisso di parametri (pesi (w)), K-NN è considerato un modello non parametrico. Ciò significa che non assume una specifica forma per la relazione tra le variabili indipendenti e la variabile dipendente. In pratica, la \\"complessità\\" del modello può crescere con i dati, dato che la ricerca dei vicini si basa sull'intero dataset di training. - **Stime Locali**: Mentre un modello lineare cerca di approssimare l'intera funzione target attraverso un'unica relazione lineare sull'intero spazio di istanza, K-NN lavora facendo stime locali. Questo significa che per ogni predizione, prende in considerazione solo un piccolo intorno del punto di interesse. Tale approccio è detto \\"localmente costante\\", poiché assume che i punti vicini nel dataset abbiano valori target simili. - **Metodi Lazy e Basati sulla Memoria/distanza**: K-NN è spesso descritto come un algoritmo \\"pigro\\" perché non impara un modello esplicito fino a quando non è necessario fare una predizione. Questa caratteristica lo rende diverso dalla maggior parte degli algoritmi di apprendimento automatico che costruiscono un modello durante la fase di training. Inoltre, essendo basato sulla memoria e sulla distanza, l'efficacia di K-NN dipende dalla qualità della misura di distanza utilizzata e dalla disponibilità di un set di dati di addestramento rappresentativo. In sintesi, il K-NN è un metodo distintivo di apprendimento automatico che si affida alla memorizzazione e all'analisi dei vicini più prossimi, piuttosto che alla costruzione di un modello esplicito, offrendo un approccio flessibile e intuitivo alla classificazione e alla regressione."},{"instruction":"Non Esiste un’Ipotesi Globale: A differenza di molti algoritmi di apprendimento supervisionato, K-NN non costruisce un modello globale basato sull’intero dataset.

Proverò a chiarirlo ulteriormente. In molti algoritmi di apprendimento supervisionato, come la regressione lineare o la regressione logistica, quando si addestra il modello sui dati, si sta essenzialmente cercando di trovare un insieme di parametri (o pesi) che meglio descrivono la relazione tra le caratteristiche (input) e i risultati (output). Questa relazione è generalizzata per l'intero spazio dei dati e si applica globalmente a tutte le possibili nuove istanze incontrate dopo l'addestramento. Quindi, quando parliamo di \\"ipotesi globale\\", ci riferiamo a questa relazione generalizzata, cioè a un modello sottostante o una \\"formula\\" che il sistema ha imparato e che può applicare uniformemente a qualsiasi nuovo dato per fare predizioni. Ad esempio, in una regressione lineare semplice con una variabile indipendente, l'ipotesi globale potrebbe essere qualcosa come (y = mx + b), dove (m) è la pendenza della linea (il peso) e (b) è l'intercetta sull'asse y. Una volta addestrato il modello, questi parametri ((m) e (b)) rappresentano l'ipotesi globale che descrive come si prevede che (x) (input) si colleghi a (y) (output) per tutti i dati. Al contrario, il modello K-NN non adotta tale approccio. Non cerca di apprendere una formula o un insieme fisso di parametri che descrive l'intero dataset. Invece, ogni volta che deve fare una previsione per un nuovo punto dati, semplicemente guarda i dati di addestramento per trovare i (k) esempi più vicini a quel punto (secondo qualche misura di distanza) e basa la sua previsione su questi esempi locali. Quindi, l'ipotesi di K-NN è \\"locale\\" in quanto si applica solo all'intorno immediato del punto di interesse, e non esiste un'ipotesi generalizzata o modello globale che descriva la relazione tra input e output per l'intero spazio dei dati. In questo senso, K-NN è fortemente basato sui dati stessi e sulla loro distribuzione, piuttosto che su una struttura parametrica predefinita che modella la relazione tra input e output."},{"instruction":"Максим решил доехать на велосипеде до дачи, которая находится на расстоянии 30 км от его дома.

There are 8 rounds. Tell me my spellcasting stats and Lily’s, which should be way lower than mine because I’m 6 years older than her. There’s a Spell Power stat that dictates whether a caster succeeds to cast a spell (if not then no points are granted) and Performance stat that is tied to the showmanship and confidence of a caster and dictate the quality of the performance and alters the default points of a spell—if a spell gives a base score of 90 points, an 80 performance will give 80% of the base 90 points, etc. But secretly at the start of the duel, Lily casts on me a spell that makes it so that every other turn, I regress physically and mentally into a 6-year-old girl, and as such my stats also regress to the stats of a mere beginner. So in the context of the duel, in odd numbered turns I’m 16, and in even numbered turns I’m 6. I’m not self aware of these changes that happen to me every turn. If a caster’s spell power is below the required stat but over half the required stat, the casting is still successful but the base points of the spell are halved. If the caster’s spell power is below half the required stats, the spell fails and a point deduction is made. Make the scenario difficult for me to win. On a difficulty scale of 1 to 10, make it a 10 (hardest mode). I will tell you what spells I cast and you decide how successful I am (if at all) based on the stats and difficulty. Only I decide what spells Sapphire casts. You decide spells for Lily. Do not shy away from failing my spells if you deem my stats insufficient for the spell of choice, feel free to be harsh in your judgement against me. Keep track of points earned. Failure to properly cast spells or bad spells will deduct points. Give two lists of 10 spells, one for Lily and one for me (plus a list baby versions of the spells for when I’m regressed). (remember spells can only be cast once throughout the duel) and what stats are required to cast them. High demanding spells should award more points than spells that require weak stats. Keep an age tracker, stats tracker, and a points tracker. Lily’s list includes an epic spell called “Escape From Maturity” which will permanently regress Sapphire and also award her 150 points.

This narrative is speculative and based on extending current understandings of climate change and solar physics into a hypothetical future. **January 2035 - Initial Signs and Warnings:** - **Rising Global Temperatures**: Scientists observed a noticeable increase in global temperatures, initially attributing this to escalating greenhouse gas emissions and worsening climate change. - **Solar Luminosity Concerns**: Astronomers reported unusual solar activity, suggesting an increase in the Sun's luminosity. This rare phenomenon prompted global attention, as any significant change in solar output could have drastic effects on Earth's climate. **February to July 2035 - Accelerating Changes:** - **Temperature Records Shattered**: Months consecutively broke temperature records across the globe. Heatwaves became more common and intense, leading to widespread health crises, particularly in regions already struggling with high temperatures. - **Ecosystems Under Stress**: Rapid warming began affecting ecosystems worldwide, with coral reefs experiencing extensive bleaching events, and polar regions showing accelerated ice melt, leading to rising sea levels. - **Agricultural Disruption**: Crop failures increased as temperatures soared, leading to food shortages and heightened global food security concerns. Some regions faced severe droughts, while others suffered from unexpected flooding due to erratic weather patterns. **August 2035 to January 2036 - Global Response and Crisis Management:** - **Emergency Meetings**: The United Nations convened emergency climate sessions, with countries debating radical interventions, including geoengineering projects to reflect sunlight or capture carbon on a massive scale. - **Social Unrest**: As food and water shortages worsened, geopolitical tension escalated. Global leaders faced increasing pressure to act, while populations in severely affected regions started showing signs of unrest and migration. - **Economic Strains**: The global economy suffered, with industries related to agriculture, insurance, and real estate being hit hardest. Governments poured resources into emergency relief, adaptation measures, and efforts to stabilize markets. **February to March 2036 - The Eve of the Heating Event:** - **Last-ditch Efforts**: In a unified but desperate effort, a coalition of nations attempted large-scale geoengineering endeavors, including stratospheric aerosol injection and ocean fertilization, to mitigate the impending catastrophe. - **Public Awareness and Preparation**: On a societal level, communities began organizing for resilience, with a focus on local food production, water conservation, and cooling shelters for vulnerable populations. **April 2036 - The Heating Event:** - **Catastrophic Temperature Increase**: Within weeks, the global average temperature spiked to 32°C. This unprecedented rise resulted in widespread environmental disasters, including devastating wildfires, superstorms, and further mass extinction events. - **Immediate Humanitarian Crises**: Large-scale evacuations and humanitarian crises unfolded as vast areas of the globe became uninhabitable due to extreme heat and weather conditions. - **Rapid Adaptation and Survival Initiatives**: In the face of this crisis, humanity's focus shifted towards survival. Underground and climate-controlled habitats began to emerge as temporary solutions, with long-term efforts focusing on reversing the damage through advanced technology and restoring the planet's climate to more hospitable conditions. **Long-term Effects and Recovery Efforts:** The aftermath of the April 2036 heating event led to a profound reevaluation of humanity's relationship with the environment and energy consumption. Recovery efforts focused on sustainable living, renewable energy sources, and repairing the Earth's damaged ecosystems. The crisis accelerated technological advancements in climate resilience, including genetically modified crops to withstand extreme heat and robotics to manage uninhabitable zones.

With average temperatures soaring and conventional measures to combat climate change proving insufficient, the USA, the European Union, and China—three of the world's leading powers, despite facing their own internal challenges and economic instabilities due to the crisis—embarked on an audacious and innovative project in February 2036: the construction of \\"Chillers.\\" # The Concept of Chillers Chillers, inspired by the concept of generators from the fictional game Frostpunk but working in reverse, were designed to provide cooling instead of heating. These colossal, cutting-edge installations aimed to counteract the unprecedented rise in global temperatures by actively cooling large areas, reducing temperatures in their immediate vicinities and thereby creating habitable zones and preserving essential ecosystems. # February to May 2036: Emergency Construction Phases **February 2036: Planning and Global Cooperation** - The first step involved intensive planning, securing funding, and technological sharing among the USA, EU, and China. Despite geopolitical tensions and competing interests, the sheer urgency of the crisis facilitated unprecedented levels of cooperation. - Sites for the Chillers were strategically chosen based on various factors including population density, risk of overheating, and ecological significance. **March 2036: Mobilization and Technological Challenges** - By March, work on the Chillers commenced. The project demanded mobilization of resources on an unimaginable scale, including manpower, materials, and energy supplies. - Engineers faced technological challenges, particularly in terms of energy efficiency and environmental impact. Solutions ranged from advanced refrigeration techniques using minimal-energy inputs to harnessing renewable energy sources and even exploring experimental technologies like artificial cloud creation for increased albedo (solar reflection). **April 2036: The Heating Event and Accelerated Efforts** - The heating event in April saw a desperate acceleration in construction efforts. The working conditions were grueling due to the extreme heat and urgency of the situation. - Amidst this chaos, the first prototypes of chillers began operation, providing critical data and hope. These initial units, though limited in scope, managed to lower temperatures significantly within their operational perimeters, offering a proof of concept and a lifeline to areas on the brink. **May 2036: Expanding the Network of Chillers** - By May, with several chillers operational and more under construction, there was a tangible impact on local climates. These zones of respite offered not just cooling but also served as centers for displaced populations, agricultural hubs for heat-resistant crop development, and biodiversity sanctuaries. - The technology advanced rapidly, with efficiency improvements and scaling efforts making the chillers more effective. International collaboration led to the sharing of best practices and technologies, speeding up the construction and optimization processes. # Aftermath and Long-term Impact While the chillers represented a monumental engineering achievement and provided critical relief, they were not a panacea. They addressed the symptom—extreme heat—without tackling the underlying causes of the climatic upheaval. The global community recognized that while chillers could offer temporary relief and localized solutions, the long-term focus needed to remain on reversing climate change through emission reductions, reforestation, ocean restoration, and sustainable practices. The chilling project catalyzed a new era of technological innovation and international collaboration.
