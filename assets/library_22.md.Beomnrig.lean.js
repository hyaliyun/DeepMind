A coach containing Thomas Renfield (Peter MacNicol), a solicitor from London, and two Transylvanian natives, rocks up a mountanous path. Renfield says he's feeling queasy and one of the helpful natives leans out the window to tell the driver to slow down. Just as he does so, he catches a glimpse of the setting sun and yells for the driver to go faster. The carriage rocks and jerks its way to the closest town.When they arrive, a townsperson opens the door of the carriage, and Renfield tumbles out headfirst. The driver throws his luggage down after him, saying he will go no further tonight. Renfield is forced to walk to his appointment at Dracula's castle, disregarding the townspeople's warnings about vampires as a silly superstition.By the time Renfield arrives, it is dark. He tries to knock at the door, but the knocker crumbles away in his hand. Just then, the doors swing open of their own accord. When Renfield steps in, the doors swing shut again and he turns around in surprise. Behind him, at the top of a long staircase, Count Dracula (Leslie Nielsen) makes his appearance. He stands still at the top of the stairs as shadow creeps forward across the wall in a predatory stance. Dracula scolds it in a foreign tongue and it retreats. Renfield, startled, turns around and is relieved to see the count. Dracula starts to introduce himself and trips on some bat guano, tumbling down the steps. He gets up at Renfield's feet, unharmed. He leads Renfield up the staircase, while his shadow limps across the wall behind him.As they walk up the stairs Dracula passes without incident through a giant spiderweb that is in the way. Renfield, confused, attempts to follow, only to become tangled in the web. He is still picking cobwebs off his clothes as he enters the room into which Dracula has led him. Dracula brings up his purchase of Carfax abbey. Renfield produces the documents. Just as Dracula is about to sign, Renfield gets a papercut.

A picture has emerged of gun victim Reeva Steenkamp blasting a pistol almost identical to the the one that killed her, at a firing range. Holding a steady arm, Reeva takes aim for the target, using both hands to clasp a 9mm handgun similar to the one South African police recovered from the home of Oscar Pistorius. The pretty blonde ensures she is fully prepared for the target practice, with ear muffs and protective glasses intact. Used to guns? This picture may give a clue into how aware Steenkamp was with the gun culture of South Africa. Evidence: A police officer holds the pistol that was allegedly used in the shooting of Reeva Steenkamp. The 'Blade Runner' is on bail awaiting trial for the murder of the former model after she was shot four times at his property on Valentine's Day. It is believed Pistorius' defence will be that he mistook her for an intruder. The picture could shed light on how connected Reeva was with guns, and that she was comfortable with her boyfriend owning one and keeping it in the house. The outing to the firing range is believe to have occurred some months before Steenkamp began dating London 2012 Olympian Pistorius. What's the story? Pistorius is on bail, accused of the murder of girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp (both pictured at an awards ceremony in Johannesburg) Guns are owned by many homeowners in Pretoria owing to the high-rate of crime, including burglary, and it is believed Pistorius owned more than one of the weapons, as well as keeping a cricket bat by his bed. Pistorius held a memorial service at his Uncle Arnold's house in Pretoria this week, and is believed to be ready to resume his training after asking for his bail conditions to be altered. It is thought that the trial could be up to a year in waiting after the double-amputee was granted bail after a two-hour court hearing a week ago. Desmond Nair, who reached the decision, deemed Pistorius not to be a flight risk, and was unlikely to commit further acts of violence when released from custody. Conditions. of his release include that he surrenders his passports and travel. documents, does not visit his house where the model died and does not. use any prohibited substances. He is also banned from drinking alcohol. Denial: Pistorius denies that he murdered his girlfriend, and his defence is expected to be that he thought she was an intruder. Pistorius, is charged with one count of premeditated murder over the February 14 killing of the FHM cover girl. He says the shooting was accidental because he thought she was a dangerous intruder inside his home. Mr Nair said Pistorius' affidavit, in which he gave his version of the events of the shooting in a sworn statement, had helped his application for bail in Pretoria Magistrate's Court. Rumours regarding the personal lives of the famous couple have been well documented. Needles and substances found at the property that were allegedly pointing towards testosterone injections have since being discounted as being used for a herbal remedy to aid muscle recovery.

Article: A new United Nations report shows that fish farming may soon be the world's most important provider of fish. The Food and Agriculture Organization says fish farming is growing at a rate of 6.6 percent a year. Fish farming now produces forty-six percent of the world's supply of fish. That represents a forty-three percent increase from 2006. The report also said fish farming earned more money in 2008 than traditional fisheries. In fish farming, fish are raised in tanks or small bodies of water called ponds. They are also raised in cages or nets in oceans, lakes and rivers. The report says increased fish farming has helped people around the world eat record amounts of fish. The FAO says each person ate an average of almost seventeen kilograms of fish last year. However, the FAO says the current yearly wild-fish harvest of ninety million tons shows no improvement. Decreasing numbers of fish and stronger catch limits have reduced the possibilities for catching wild fish. The FAO report says about thirty-two percent of world supplies are overfished. It says these supplies of fish need to be rebuilt at once. Some scientists have criticized fish farming. They say the nets and cages permit fish diseases and pests to spread. Some fish farming critics doubt whether fish farming can keep growing at the current rate. But Wally Stevens of the trade group Global Aquaculture Alliance says the industry must continue developing to feed growing populations. Mr. Stevens says a one hundred percent increase in fish farming over ten years is necessary to keep providing for people at the current level. He notes that fish farming creates jobs and wealth, especially for people in coastal areas of China. Question: We learn that since the year 2006, fish farming has been   _  .

Italy's air was very polluted, while Greece had problems with drought.  Which country had less acid precipitation fall in forests?  Hint: One result of air pollution is acid rain. Acid rain is precipitation with a low (acidic) pH. This rain can be very destructive to wildlife. When acid rain falls in forests, freshwater habitats, or soils, it can kill insects and aquatic life. It causes this damage because of its very low pH. Sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides in the air both cause acid rain to form ( Figure below ).

The race pits controversial Republican Roy Moore, who is battling sexual harassment allegations, against Democrat Doug Jones, a former prosecutor. The outcome of the race could have national implications for both political parties and for President Donald Trump. Moore has denied several allegations of sexual misconduct when he was in his 30s involving women who were teenagers at the time, including one who was 14. \\"I do not know them. I had no encounter with them. I never molested anyone,\\" Moore said in a televised interview Sunday with the Voice of Alabama Politics.

And the answer is...","output":"To solve the equation -68w + 134w = 84w - 54 for w, we first need to simplify and combine like terms on both sides of the equation. 1. Combine the w terms on the left side of the equation: (-68w + 134w) = 66w  So, the equation becomes: 66w = 84w - 54 2. Next, we want to isolate the variable w by combining the w terms on both sides of the equation. We will do this by subtracting 66w from both sides: 66w - 66w = 84w - 54 - 66w Now, the left side of the equation becomes 0: 0 = 18w - 54 3. To isolate w further, we need to add 54 to both sides of the equation: 0 + 54 = 18w - 54 + 54 54 = 18w 4. Now, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 18 to solve for w: 54 ÷ 18 = 18w ÷ 18 5.

Answer the following question: Article: One day, a man found the cocoon   of a butterfly and he brought it home. A few days later, the man saw a small hole in the cocoon. He sat and watched for several hours as a butterfly struggled to force its body through that little hole. Then it stopped. So the man decided to help the butterfly. He took a knife and cut a bigger hole in the cocoon. The butterfly came out of the cocoon but it had a weak body and small, thin wings. The butterfly didn't start to fly. In fact, the butterfly spent the rest of its life crawling  around with a weak body and thin wings. It was never able to fly. The man acted with kindness but he didn't understand that he had done something wrong. When a butterfly crawls out of the cocoon, it must struggle. The hard work of getting out of the cocoon forces the fluid  from the butterfly's body into wings. It helps the butterfly be ready to fly. If the butterfly never has to force itself out of the cocoon, its wings never get the fluid and it can never fly. Sometimes struggles are exactly what we need in our lives. If we lived our lives without any problems, we would never learn or grow. We would not be as strong as we could have been and we would never fly. So, the next time you are faced with a challenge or a problem, remember the butterfly. Struggle a little - then fly! Question: What does the writer want to tell us?

And 71% of the heads polled were only able to balance their budgets by making cuts or dipping into reserves, said NAHT general secretary Russell Hobby. The government said it had protected the core schools budget in real terms. The NAHT's Breaking Point survey for 2016-17 shows: The greatest cost pressures on schools, according to heads, are: According to the union, almost 80% of schools are providing support for children with mental health issues from general school budgets, \\"stepping in where cuts in health and social care funding have failed to meet the growing demand for support\\". Mr Hobby said 98% of schools were losing funding \\"at a time when costs are rising and pupil numbers are growing\\". \\"The government must take urgent action and commit to funding schools sufficiently in the next Budget. It is time to stop viewing education spending as a cost and to start seeing it as an investment in England's future, and in our children's.\\" Liam Collins head of Uplands Community College in Wadhurst, East Sussex, said budget pressures amounted to \\"a cut of 10 teachers, fewer clubs, no pastoral support, a narrowed curriculum, no counselling for students struggling with mental health issues, crumbling buildings, no IT upgrades, no new textbooks and no school planners. \\"Eventually this will impact on student outcomes.\\" Labour said the NAHT's survey showed ministers \\"continue to hide their heads in the sand\\" on school funding.

NATO aircraft targeted warships overnight, striking eight of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi's vessels in Tripoli's seaport, the organization said Friday morning. A Libyan government official said the targets included commercial vessels as well as military ones. \\"All NATO's targets are military in nature and are directly linked to the Gadhafi regime's systematic attacks on the Libyan people,\\" said Rear Adm. Russell Harding, deputy commander of Operation Unified Protector. \\"Given the escalating use of naval assets, NATO had no choice but to take decisive action to protect the civilian population of Libya and NATO forces at sea.\\" In a statement, NATO said the attack occurred after two weeks of escalating use of government maritime forces that had disrupted the flow of humanitarian assistance. All the vessels targeted were naval warships with no civilian utility, said Harding. But a Libyan official who led CNN personnel on a tour of the area said the commercial port, not the nearby military port, was hit. From the distance at which CNN was allowed to view the area, it was not clear what sort of vessels were hit. The port's general manager, Mohammed Ahmed Rashed, told reporters that six rockets struck in three strikes that hit five coast guard boats and one navy vessel, which had been in dock for maintenance. The port remained operational, he said. Libyan government spokesman Moussa Ibrahim called the attack a \\"clear attempt to bring the nation to its knees,\\" and said the port serves as the main entry point for food and other critical supplies into the country. \\"The nation will starve,\\" he said. Still, though the port was in disarray, the damage did not appear major, he said. Ibrahim's claims came as President Barack Obama, addressing a global audience, condemned the use of force against Arab Spring protesters by longtime allies and adversaries alike. \\"Obama is still delusional,\\" Ibrahim said. \\"He believes the lies that his own government is spreading around the world and his own media is spreading around the world. They have not proved one single charge against us and they refuse to investigate us.\\" He added, \\"It's not Obama who decides whether Moammar Gadhafi leaves Libya or not. It's the Libyan people who decide their future.\\" The report of the attack came shortly after at least three explosions could be heard in the city. A government official said five airstrikes had targeted the port and the police academy was also hit on Thursday, during which NATO jets could be seen been flying overhead throughout the day. Libyan state-run television reported the strikes with a \\"breaking news\\" font that said, \\"Military source: Residential and military locations in Tripoli are currently being shelled by NATO forces.\\" Earlier Thursday, crowds of Libyans took to the streets of Tripoli, honking horns and dancing in the streets in support of the country's leader, Moammar Gadhafi. More than 100 people outside the headquarters of state television chanted \\"God, Moammar and Libya only\\" and other pro-Gadhafi and anti-rebel slogans. The demonstrations were sparked, apparently, in response to state-run television reports that parts of the rebel capital Benghazi were \\"rejecting the colonialists and their followers,\\" as the government describes NATO and the rebels. A group of journalists, including a CNN team, was taken by government minders to see the celebrations in Tripoli. Among the crowds composed predominantly of young men were a number of families -- including fathers carrying children on their shoulders. One woman, who brought her 10-year-old-daughter, carried a portrait of the Libyan leader and said they were celebrating their country being united again. Many then drove toward Tripoli's Green Square singing and honking their horns, waving Libya's green flag and portraits of Gadhafi. But CNN journalists in Benghazi saw no indications of counter-revolutionary uprisings or protests there. And the National Transitional Council denied government claims that pro-Gadhafi forces had seized control of the city. And residents of Benghazi said they had not seen or heard of pro-Gadhafi rallies there. Two months ago, Gadhafi loyalists in Tripoli erupted in similar cheers when state media incorrectly reported that Tobruk and Benghazi had fallen to government troops. Gadhafi has been fighting to keep control of his country in the face of an uprising that has led to a number of key cities falling into rebel control. The chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court this week requested a warrant for Gadhafi's arrest on charges of crimes against humanity. CNN's Ben Wedeman and Jomana Karadsheh contributed to this report.

Q: Answer the following question given this paragraph:   Pancreatic Secretion Regulation of pancreatic secretion is the job of hormones and the parasympathetic nervous system. The entry of acidic chyme into the duodenum stimulates the release of secretin, which in turn causes the duct cells to release bicarbonaterich pancreatic juice. The presence of proteins and fats in the duodenum stimulates the secretion of CCK, which then stimulates the acini to secrete enzyme-rich pancreatic juice and enhances the activity of secretin. Parasympathetic regulation occurs mainly during the cephalic and gastric phases of gastric secretion, when vagal stimulation prompts the secretion of pancreatic juice. Usually, the pancreas secretes just enough bicarbonate to counterbalance the amount of HCl produced in the stomach. Hydrogen ions enter the blood when bicarbonate is secreted by the pancreas. Thus, the acidic blood draining from the pancreas neutralizes the alkaline blood draining from the stomach, maintaining the pH of the venous blood that flows to the liver.   Q: The entry of acidic chyme into the duodenum stimulates the release of what?   A: Choices: (a). progesterone (b). gastrin (c). oxygen (d). secretin The answer is:","output":"(d). secretin In the given paragraph, it is mentioned that \\"The entry of acidic chyme into the duodenum stimulates the release of secretin.\\" Therefore, the correct answer to the question is secretin."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the below context:  In the latter years of the 20th century the opera was a regular feature in many European cities, and was still breaking new ground; in 1990 it made its debut at the Slovak National Theatre in Bratislava. Vienna saw it for the first time in 1994, at the Vienna Volksoper, in what John Rockwell in the New York Times described as \\"an awkwardly updated production\\", though well performed. The opera had not so far proved particularly popular in the United States, where since the Met premiere of 1916, performances had been rare compared with Europe. Lyric Opera of Chicago staged it in 1966, but waited until 1998 before reviving it. In 1980 the New York City Opera mounted a production based on the 1863 edition, and staged it again in 1983 and 1986. Reviewing the 1986 production, Henahan wrote that despite the inept libretto the work was saved by the \\"melodic suppleness and warmth\\" of Bizet's score.San Diego Opera first staged the work in 1993, but it was this company's 2004 production, designed by Zandra Rhodes, that generated new levels of enthusiasm for the opera throughout the United States. In the following few years this production was shown in seven other U.S. opera houses; in October 2008 James C.

Liam started reading about apex predators, while Fox read about grazers and large herbivores.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which cousin learned less about wildlife management?  Hint: An apex predator, also known as an alpha predator or top predator, is a predator at the top of a food chain, with no natural predators.Apex predators are usually defined in terms of trophic dynamics, meaning that they occupy the highest trophic levels. Food chains are often far shorter on land, usually limited to being secondary consumers – for example, wolves prey mostly upon large herbivores (primary consumers), which eat plants (primary producers). The apex predator concept is applied in wildlife management, conservation and ecotourism. Answer:","output":"It would be incorrect to state that one cousin learned less about wildlife management than the other, as both Liam and Fox learned about different aspects of food chains and ecosystems, which are interconnected and essential to understanding wildlife management. Liam, who read about apex predators, learned about the role of top predators in regulating ecosystems, population dynamics, and the health of other species within the food chain. This is an important aspect of wildlife management, as it highlights the need for conservation efforts that protect apex predators and maintain the population balance of an ecosystem. On the other hand, Fox learned about grazers and large herbivores, which are also crucial for understanding wildlife management. Grazers and large herbivores play a significant role in shaping ecosystems, as they promote plant diversity and maintain habitat structure. The trophic interactions between primary consumers and primary producers are essential for the overall health and functioning of an ecosystem. Knowing how these interactions work can provide insights for wildlife managers on the importance of maintaining the balance of different species and managing habitats effectively. Both aspects of food chains, apex predators and grazers/large herbivores, are integral for the comprehensive understanding of wildlife management strategies. While each cousin learned about a specific part of the ecosystem, they both contributed to the collective understanding of wildlife management. To obtain a more holistic comprehension, it would be ideal for Liam and Fox to share their knowledge and learn from each other, as both areas are important for effective wildlife management, conservation, and ecotourism."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Juvenile smoking behavior is negatively impacted by price, suggesting that increasing the cost of cigarettes would lead to a decrease in consumption among young people. This implies that they are responsive to incentives. 2. The decline in teenage pregnancies can be attributed to a combination of lower welfare benefits and an increased awareness of the risks associated with sexually transmitted diseases, such as AIDS. This again demonstrates that teenagers respond to incentives and can be deterred from engaging in risky behavior. 3. The assertion is made that teenagers have the same cognitive abilities as adults and are therefore capable of assessing and reacting to changes in incentive structures. 4. It is argued that even if teenagers prioritize peer recognition over incentives, they still take into account the consequences of their actions, such as legal penalties, and adjust their behavior accordingly. In summary, the central debate topic revolves around the capacity of teenagers and juveniles to make rational decisions based on incentives and disincentives, and whether these factors can effectively deter them from engaging in risky behaviors."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie critic      Ava DuVernay’s adaptation of “A Wrinkle in Time” arrives with more than its share of hype, generated by fans dedicated to Madeleine L’Engle’s 1962 children’s book as well as by DuVernay’s distinction as the first African American woman to direct a movie with a 100 million budget.      At a recent screening, the filmmaker herself seemed eager to manage expectations. In a taped prologue, DuVernay urged filmgoers to watch the movie while in touch with their “inner child,” a useful piece of advice for a movie that turns out to be a kids’ film, for better and for worse. “A Wrinkle in Time” may not be an epic game-changer on par with “Wonder Woman” and “Black Panther,” to which it has already been unfairly compared. Yet this pleasing if modest fantasy ad­ven­ture possesses all the strengths and weaknesses of its source material, with DuVernay’s sensibility suffusing the enterprise with a timely sense of urgency and relevance.      Perhaps DuVernay’s most canny move lies in her casting, which involves some familiar faces reframed in fantastical dimensions, as well as marvelous discoveries. Storm Reid plays Meg Murry, the 14-year-old misfit who’s been in a perpetual bad mood since her physicist father, Alex (Chris Pine), disappeared four years ago. Living in her cozy Compton home with her scientist mother, Kate (Gugu Mbatha-Raw), and 5-year-old brother, Charles Wallace (Deric McCabe), Meg isn’t nearly as comfortable at school, where she’s chronically bullied by the resident mean girls.      [Why Ava DuVernay is exactly what we need right now]      Things change when a mysterious woman named Mrs. Whatsit visits on a dark and stormy night, setting Meg, Charles Wallace and Meg’s school friend Calvin (Levi Miller) on a search for Alex that will take them to the furthest reaches of the universe. Aided by Mrs. Who and Mrs. Which, Meg gets in touch with her powers, culminating in nothing less than a fight between good and evil.            Watch out, Storm’s ahead: Storm Reid is excellent as Meg, the outsider 14-year-old at the heart of the story. (Walt Disney Pictures)      Delivering a sturdy, self-possessed performance as “A Wrinkle in Time’s” heroine, Reid proves a thoroughly capable leading lady, her slightly nerdish appeal something of a twin to Letitia Wright’s precocious young scientist in “Black Panther.” (Let’s hear it for Girls Who Code.) If the original character’s rough edges have been over-sanded here, Reid is still convincing as a girl who’s angry and grieving over the loss of a pivotal figure in her life, both defiant and afraid of putting a foot wrong.      [Beloved books can turn into terrible movies. Will ‘A Wrinkle in Time’ beat the odds?]      McCabe, for his part, plays the preternaturally confident Charles Wallace with scene-stealing glee, his little-man maturity modulating into something far more troubling as Meg’s journey grows more perilous. If Miller has less material to work with as Calvin, he gracefully cedes the limelight to the brother-sister act. All three young people more than hold their own when they’re being towered over — literally — by the three Mrs. W’s, portrayed by Reese Witherspoon, Mindy Kaling and Oprah Winfrey, respectively.      [Publishers rejected her, Christians attacked her: Madeleine L’Engle and faith]      Decked out in magnificent wigs and gowns, their lips and eyes bedazzled with metallic makeup sure to launch a thousand YouTube tutorials, Witherspoon, Kaling and Winfrey show up and disappear with sometimes perfunctory suddenness. (Like Calvin, they’re also stranded with little to do except, literally, stand there and slay in a procession of otherworldly looks.) “A Wrinkle in Time” is plagued by the same convoluted leaps and hurried lack of logic that Washington Post critic Michael Dirda recently pointed out in L’Engle’s original book. At a time when movies are almost uniformly too long, this is one film that could have benefited from a few more scenes to plump up Meg’s backstory, solidify the emotional stakes and smooth out transitions that are jagged at best, nonsensical at worst.      [‘A Wrinkle in Time’: Let’s hope the movie is better than the book]      Still, with its bright color palette, appealing lead players and moments of comic relief — Zach Galifianakis shows up to play a rather anxious Happy Medium — “A Wrinkle in Time” is often beautiful to watch. (Sequences amid the Skittles-hued conformity of the planet Camazotz are particularly well staged.) And DuVernay injects subtle cues that remind viewers of the story’s revolutionary potential that was so incendiary 50 years ago that some institutions once banned the book. There’s a lovely shot, early in the movie, when Charles Wallace waits in the principal’s office, his posture echoed by James Baldwin in a photo hanging on the wall. In L’Engle’s original telling, Mrs. Who quoted the likes of Shakespeare, Dante and Euripides; DuVernay adds epigrams from Rumi, Outkast and Lin-Manuel Miranda. As a clarion call for young people rising up against the forces of cynicism, corruption and wanton cruelty, “A Wrinkle in Time” feels decidedly of-the-moment, a primer for the little brothers and sisters of the #NeverAgain generation. Even without every flaw completely ironed out, it offers values worth celebrating across the time-space continuum.

(Atsushi Nishijima/Walt Disney Pictures) ||||| But actually, it’s a rather sweet and charming old-fashioned story about a quest and the age-old battle between good and evil.      Teenage Meg (12 Years a Slave’s Storm Reid) is having a rough time at school with one particularly nasty “mean girl” while suffering — along with Mom and younger brother, Charles Wallace (Deric McCabe) — the loss of their physicist dad, Alex, who disappeared down a rabbit hole of sorts (quantum physics-wise) four years earlier.      Charles, a strange and brilliant child, has a plan to find him, involving using three rather unusual spirit guides, Mrs. Whatsit, Mrs. Who and Mrs. Which, to take him and Meg and her friend Calvin (Levi Miller), across time and space to bring back dear old Dad.      It’s a Disney film with a 100-million-plus budget so expect top-notch CGI, imaginatively rendered sets and costumes and a really great cast.      The story itself — adapted from that of the classic young-adult novel by Madeleine L’Engle — is a bit confusing (unless you’re a physicist) so don’t spent too much worrying about the fine details and go along for the ride, which is emotionally charged, tension-filled and ultimately satisfying.      What raises the film up isn’t the splendidly rendered special effects or the big star names such as Oprah Winfrey as Mrs. Which (and Mindy Kaling as Mrs. Who) or even Chris Pine, who’s mostly absent as Dad. It’s the wonderful and surprisingly mature performances of the three young principals. ||||| Published on Nov 19, 2017      On March 9th, be a warrior.

Through one girl’s transformative journey led by three celestial guides, we discover that strength comes from embracing one’s individuality and that the best way to triumph over fear is to travel by one’s own light.            Directed by Emmy(R) winner and Oscar(R) and Golden Globe(R) nominee Ava DuVernay from a screenplay by Oscar winner Jennifer Lee based upon the beloved novel by Madeleine L’Engle, “A Wrinkle in Time” stars: two-time Academy Award(R) nominee Oprah Winfrey, Oscar and Emmy winner Reese Witherspoon, Emmy nominee Mindy Kaling, Gugu Mbatha-Raw, Michael Peňa and introducing Storm Reid, with two-time Emmy winner Zach Galifianakis and Emmy nominee Chris Pine.            Produced by Jim Whitaker and Catherine Hand with Doug Merrifield serving as executive producer, the film also boasts an impressive creative team featuring some of the most talented artisans working today, including: Tobias Schliessler, ASC as director of photography, Naomi Shohan as production designer, Oscar(R)-nominee Spencer Averick as film editor, two-time Academy Award(R)-nominee Paco Delgado as costume designer and four time Emmy(R) nominee Ramin Djawadi as composer. ||||| The other two supernatural beings are not as effective. Mrs Whatsit in the book is a tiny little old woman, while Mrs Which is, well, a witch. Reese Witherspoon plays Mrs Whatsit in the movie, and is not a little old woman but instead a beautiful and slightly mean character with long red hair who transforms into a gigantic cabbage creature. Mrs Which, the most powerful of the trio, is played by Oprah Winfrey. It’s a Winfrey-ish role, as she stands slightly apart from the human world and dispenses warm wisdom from her lofty and grand position in the universe. But that performance gives the slightly unfortunate effect of Oprah Winfrey playing Oprah Winfrey in this troubled girl’s life.      L’Engle’s book derives its magic from refracting and magnifying Meg’s pain, anger, and impotent rage into a fantasy quest. As in Labyrinth, another children’s classic, the challenges ahead reflect the problems in her life. She fears that the father has abandoned the family, and is furious at him for disappearing. She rails against adults with power and cries and stamps her feet—until she realizes that it is harder, but more powerful, to make decisions on your own. The three magical beings that guide her on her mission lead her to that conclusion as much as to her lost father: “We want nothing from you that you do without grace,” Mrs Whatsit says, “or that you do without understanding.”’      It’s a gorgeous lesson. The problem with A Wrinkle in Time comes from its art direction. DuVernay conjures some fantastical scenes, especially on the beautiful planet Uriel. But instead of the book’s dreaminess, Uriel is so bright and polished that it resembles a screensaver. Its topography is reminiscent of Avatar. There’s a sweet patch of flowers that communicate with the young travelers in a cloud of twittering petals. But again, they are so neon that they look videogame-ish, rather than like a dream.      DuVernay has also updated the disturbing Camazotz, the evil planet in A Wrinkle in Time where Meg’s father is lost. In the book, the planet contains a terrifyingly regulated city where all kids have to bounce a ball in time with each other, and workers come and go from their office buildings at exactly the same time and with identical briefcases. It’s an administrative dystopia that’s flavored strongly by Orwell and Huxley. In the movie, DuVernay uses nightmare scenarios that are more familiar to children. Instead of being scared in an office building, they’re disoriented on an extremely crowded beach. DuVernay keeps the kids bouncing balls, but she has them bounce in a very slightly irregular rhythm that ups the dread factor.      If I’m playing up the little details that mark DuVernay’s skill as a director, it’s because I simply have no idea how today’s children will interpret her world in its entirety. Doubtless, it’s a great thing to have more protagonists of color, and DuVernay has achieved much in her casting and her innovations. But that issue of texture stayed with me throughout the movie, and it emptied out this world of its magic. Is imagination just a different game for kids now? As a critic, it may be that I don’t have the means to evaluate a work of art that’s supposed to be magical, because I can’t retrofit my childhood to one colored by Disney Channel super-saturation. But this movie relied so heavily on the glinting plastic toolbox of CGI that the magic just never arrived. The kid in me left the theater sadly disappointed. ||||| If there’s a secret to a successful screen adaptation of “A Wrinkle in Time,” it’s still secret. Disney’s version of the Madeleine L’Engle young-adult novel is a magical mystery tour minus the magic and mystery, and a great disappointment, since there were so many reasons to root for the film’s success. It’s a racially diverse production with elaborate sci-fi trappings centered on Meg Murry (Storm Reid), a smart, brave girl who is searching distant planets for her vanished father. It’s also the first time a black woman, Ava DuVernay, has directed a megabudget studio spectacular. But a vital spark is missing, and all the... ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"\\"A Wrinkle in Time\\" is a movie directed by Ava DuVernay, based on a popular children's book by Madeleine L'Engle. The film tells the story of a 14-year-old girl, Meg, who, with the help of three mysterious beings, goes on a magical adventure across space to find her missing physicist father. Throughout her journey, Meg learns about bravery, individuality and the power of good over evil. The film was made with a big budget and features a diverse cast and beautiful, colorful special effects. But, much like the original book, the movie sometimes has parts that can be confusing and may have needed a few more scenes to make certain parts more clear. Even still, the film reminds us of how revolutionary the book's story was when it first came out, and inspires today's young people to stand up against negativity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Cheney calls for airstrike after Iran's refusal to hand back downed spy plane. Iranian fury over Congress calls to assassinate key members of their Revolutionary Guard. Article:","output":"Title: Tensions Rise as Oil Shipping Lane Crisis and Political Conflicts Intensify Between the US and Iran Introduction: The world's most critical oil shipping lane, a four-mile-wide strait, has become the center of attention following false reports of its closure, causing a substantial leap in the price of crude oil. Additionally, increasing political tensions between the US and Iran continue to escalate, with Vice President Cheney calling for an airstrike in response to Iran's refusal to hand back a downed spy plane and Iran fuming over the Congress calls for the assassination of key members of their Revolutionary Guard. 1. The Importance of the Four-Mile-Wide Strait: The four-mile-wide strait in question is a vital artery for global oil transportation, playing a significant role in the global economy. Any disruption or closure of this strategic shipping lane could have wide-ranging ramifications on oil prices worldwide, making the situation even more delicate amid the rising tensions between Iran and the United States. 2. Inaccurate Reports of Strait Closure and Effect on Oil Prices: False reports of the critical shipping lane being closed off have already caused a spike in crude oil prices. These inaccurate claims demonstrate how sensitive oil markets can be in the face of geopolitical uncertainties and potential threats to supply chains. It is crucial that the international community and relevant stakeholders work together to ensure the stability of the global oil transportation networks. 3. Vice President Cheney Advocates for Airstrike After Downed Spy Plane: The stakes in the ongoing conflict between the US and Iran have been further raised as Vice President Cheney calls for an airstrike on Iranian territory. This move comes after Iran's refusal to return a captured American spy plane, adding more complexity to the already-tense relationship between the two nations. 4. Iranian Response to Congress Calls for Assassinations: Iran has reacted with fury over the US Congress' appeal to assassinate key figures within their Revolutionary Guard. This provocative move not only exacerbates the existing animosity between Iran and the US but also risks further destabilizing the region and fueling additional retaliation from Iran. Conclusion: The mounting geopolitical tensions between the US and Iran continue to have significant implications on both domestic and international fronts. The importance of the four-mile-wide strait as a vital oil shipping lane and the inflammatory nature of political moves such as calls for assassination and airstrikes make it essential for both parties to work diligently to de-escalate the situation. It is in the best interest of global stability and economic security for the US and Iran to find a diplomatic resolution to their ongoing disputes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

British Television Network (BTN) The answer to this question is:","output":"Title: Shadows of the Network Step 1: Introducing the protagonist and setting  The movie plot is set in a near-future dystopian Britain where BTN (British Television Network) holds a significant influence over the country's media and politics. Evey Hammond, a young and ambitious woman, starts her career as a junior journalist and producer at BTN, hoping to make an impact with her journalism skills. Step 2: Setting up the conflict As Evey becomes more involved in her work at BTN, she discovers that the network has an underlying darker agenda – they control public opinion using manipulative news and content production to support their political allies and crush dissenting voices.  Step 3: Evey's inner conflict  As she slowly uncovers the truth behind BTN's actions, Evey faces an inner conflict – should she simply keep her head down and try to climb the ranks within the BTN without compromising her values, or should she risk everything to expose the network's hidden illicit political ties and manipulation of the masses.  Step 4: Building alliances Evey forms a friendship and alliance with her colleague at BTN, Adrian, who shares her concerns about the organization's unethical behavior. Together, they start to investigate and gather evidence to unveil the corruption inside BTN. Step 5: A turning point To maintain their control, BTN executives decide to move forward with a plan that would further stifle the independence of other news outlets, endangering the very essence of free press. Evey and Adrian realize that the time to act is now, or else it may be too late. Step 6: Exposing the truth The two brave journalists use their access to the network's live broadcast system to broadcast damning evidence of BTN's dark side to the entire nation. They reveal secret agreements with powerful politicians and unveil the ways in which BTN manipulates information to distort public perception. Step 7: Aftermath  The revelation sends shockwaves through the country, leading to widespread protests and a call for transparency in the media. Evey and Adrian are now regarded as heroes for their courageous actions and use their newfound influence to further the cause of freedom of the press and to fight against corruption in media organizations. Step 8: Ending Despite their initial success, Evey and Adrian understand that the fight is far from over, as powerful figures behind the scenes would still attempt to suppress the truth and manipulate the masses. With a renewed sense of purpose, they vow to continue their fight for the freedom of the press and a more just society. In conclusion, \\"Shadows of the Network\\" is a gripping story of Evey Hammond's struggle to expose the corrupt British Television Network (BTN). By creating alliances with her colleague Adrian and risking their careers, they work together to bring the truth to light and fight for a better, more transparent society."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It has long been suspected that rhyolites from the northern Preseli Hills helped build the monument. But research by National Museum Wales and Leicester University has identified their source to within 70m (230ft) of Craig Rhos-y-felin, near Pont Saeson. The museum's Dr Richard Bevins said the find would help experts work out how the stones were moved to Wiltshire. For nine months Dr Bevins, keeper of geology at National Museum Wales, and Dr Rob Ixer of Leicester University collected and identified samples from rock outcrops in Pembrokeshire to try to find the origins of rhyolite debitage rocks that can be found at Stonehenge. By detailing the mineral content and the textural relationships within the rock, a process known as petrography, they found that 99% of the samples could be matched to rocks found in this particular set of outcrops. Rhyolitic rocks at Rhos-y-felin, between Ffynnon-groes (Crosswell) and Brynberian, differ from all others in south Wales, they said, which helps locate almost all of Stonehenge's rhyolites to within hundreds of square metres. Within that area, the rocks differ on a scale of metres or tens of metres, allowing Dr Bevins and Dr Ixer to match some Stonehenge rock samples even more precisely to a point at the extreme north-eastern end of Rhos-y-felin. Dr Rob Ixer of Leicester University called the discovery of the source of the rocks \\"quite unexpected and exciting\\". \\"Being able to provenance any archaeologically significant rock so precisely is remarkable,\\" he said. \\"However, given continued perseverance, we are determined that we shall uncover the origins of most, if not all of the Stonehenge bluestones so allowing archaeologists to continue their speculations well into a third century.\\" With the location identified, archaeologists will now be able to dig to try and uncover how the stones from Pembrokeshire reached Stonehenge. \\"Many have asked the question over the years, how the stones got from Pembrokeshire to Stonehenge,\\" said Dr Bevins. \\"Was it human transport? Was it due to ice transport? \\"Thanks to geological research, we now have a specific source for the rhyolite stones from which to work and an opportunity for archaeologists to answer the question that has been widely debated. \\"It is important now that the research continues.\\" Work is continuing to identify the source of four other stones at Stonehenge which do not come from Rhos-y-felin, he said. Experts have long theorised on how the stones were transported from Pembrokeshire to the Stonehenge site when the monument was built from around 3000 BC to 1600 BC. Perceived wisdom had it that the giant slabs were moved via raft, up the Bristol Channel and River Avon. But as Pont Saeson is to the north of the Preselis some believe its unlikely that they would have been able to navigate the terrain in order to get the enormous rocks to the coast. An alternative theory was that nature drove the stone to Stonehenge, in the path of an Ice Age glacier, although the absence of any other Welsh rock in the region seemed to have ruled out the possibility. In April 2000 a National Lottery Heritage Lottery Fund plan was launched to replicate the 240-mile (386 km) journey of a giant stone from west Wales to Salisbury Plain, by land and sea. The millennium bluestone project, which tried to use only muscle power and the technology of the ancients, ended in disaster when the stone sank in Milford Haven estuary.

They studied the rocks very carefully to find out where they came from.  This discovery is important because now experts can try to figure out how the big rocks were moved from Wales to Stonehenge in England a long time ago.

The user mentions two different emotions in their tweet - a desire to have fun with their friends, and a dislike for the rain. Step 2: Break down the tweet into sentiment-related phrases. 1. \\"would like to have fun with my friends\\" - This is a positive sentiment, as the user wants to enjoy time with their friends. 2. \\"i hate the rain\\" - This is a negative sentiment, as the user expresses their dislike for rain. Step 3: Analyze and balance the overall sentiment. While the tweet contains both positive and negative sentiments, it leans towards a more negative tone. This is because the focus of the tweet is on the user's disappointment (hating the rain), which may be preventing them from having fun with their friends. Step 4: Predict the sentiment of the tweet.

Considering the risk of showing same-sex relationships before the late 1980's, Personal Best could have done better to play the same-sex relationship between Hemingway (Chris Cahill) and Donnelly (Tory Skinner) as a more than experimental phase of Cahill's life. It seems to me that the creators of this movie threw in the same-sex relationship between two fairly attractive women in order to attract viewers. Also consider the 90 seconds of exposing the crotches of several women jumping backwards over a high jump pole. This random scene had VERY LITTLE relevance to the movie and it appeared as though this was done merely to keep the audience interested in this bland movie. I suppose the producers were trying to counteract the boring plot and the even more boring setting of the movie (the 1980 Oregon Track and Field Competition). This review may seem harsh, but it is the truth. The exploitation of young Muriel Hemingway's body and the same-sex relationship ruined any credit that I would have given to this film.

Mash your words together and spread your vowels out for the Long Island classic accent. Use some local, if cliched, colloquialisms. Listen to native New Yorkers, online or in person, to get the subtle range of different accents.\\" Article:","output":"Title: Mastering the Classic Long Island Accent: Tips, Techniques, and Insights Introduction The Long Island accent, a distinct dialect native to Long Island, New York, is famous for its often exaggerated and dramatic inflections. Whether you're an actor preparing for a role, a linguist studying dialects, or simply someone who enjoys mimicking accents, achieving the perfect Long Island accent can be a fun and rewarding challenge. In this article, we'll delve into the nuances of the Long Island accent and provide practical tips on how to speak like a true native New Yorker. The Roots of the Long Island Accent The Long Island accent is a variation of the broader New York accent, which itself has roots in the varied ethnicities and cultural influences that have shaped the region over the centuries. The accent is most heavily influenced by Irish, Italian, and Jewish immigrants who settled in the area during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. As a result of these diverse origins, there is a wide range of accents and dialects within the broader New York accent, from the nasally Bronx dialect to the more extravagant Long Island variant. Key Components of the Long Island Accent 1. Nasal and constricted speech One of the most distinctive characteristics of the classic Long Island accent is its nasally, almost constricted quality. To achieve this, try speaking as if your throat is slightly tight, forcing the sound to come more from your nasal passages than down in your chest. This might take some practice, but it is an essential aspect of the accent. 2. Attitude and speech rhythms Another common feature of the Long Island accent is a certain attitude and distinct rhythm in speech. Long Islanders tend to embody a unique blend of confidence, assertiveness, and a touch of brashness in their vocal patterns. Experiment with your tone and delivery, and practice emphasizing certain syllables within a sentence to create a more dynamic and engaging speaking style. 3. Mashed words and elongated vowels Pronunciation plays a big role in perfecting the Long Island accent. Often, words are spoken with a rushed or \\"mashed\\" quality, as if blending multiple syllables into a singular sound. For example, \\"Long Island\\" might be pronounced as \\"Lawn Guyland,\\" or \\"morning\\" as \\"mawnin.\\" Additionally, some vowels are stretched out or elongated, such as the \\"aw\\" sound in \\"law\\" or \\"coffee\\" being pronounced as \\"caw-fee.\\" 4. Local colloquialisms To truly capture the Long Island accent, it's crucial to sprinkle your speech with some local, albeit sometimes cliched, colloquialisms. Phrases like \\"fuhgeddaboudit,\\" \\"yooz guyz,\\" and \\"mad good\\" can help add authenticity to your accent while demonstrating your familiarity with the local vernacular. 5. Listen and learn from native New Yorkers Immersing yourself in the sounds and speech patterns of native Long Islanders is perhaps the most important aspect of mastering the accent. It's possible to find a wealth of resources online, including interviews and videos featuring residents of the region. Additionally, consider visiting Long Island and engaging in conversation with locals to further hone your skills and pick up on the subtle variations within the accent. Conclusion The Long Island accent is a colorful and unique dialect that reflects the rich history and cultural influences of the region. By practicing nasal and constricted speech patterns, adopting the attitude and rhythms of the dialect, mashing your words, elongating vowels, and incorporating colloquialisms, you'll be well on your way to perfecting the Long Island accent. So, go ahead – give it a whirl, and soon enough, you'll be sounding like a true native New Yorker!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

It is Canada's most populous province by a large margin, accounting for nearly 40 percent of all Canadians, and is the second-largest province in total area. Ontario is fourth-largest in total area when the territories of the Northwest Territories and Nunavut are included. It is home to the nation's capital city, Ottawa, and the nation's most populous city, Toronto.  - Head of government is a generic term used for either the highest or second highest official in the executive branch of a sovereign state, a federated state, or a self-governing colony, (commonly referred to as countries, nations or nation-states) who often presides over a cabinet, a group of ministers or secretaries who lead executive departments. The term \\"head of government\\" is often differentiated from the term \\"head of state\\", (e.g. as in article 7 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, article 1 of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Crimes against Internationally Protected Persons, including Diplomatic Agents and the United Nations protocol list), as they may be separate positions, individuals, and/or roles depending on the country.  - Ohio is an Eastern state in the Great Lakes region of the United States. Ohio is the 34th largest by area, the 7th most populous, and the 10th most densely populated of the 50 United States.

The president directs the executive branch of the federal government and is the commander-in-chief of the United States Armed Forces.  - Illinois is a state in the midwestern region of the United States, achieving statehood in 1818. It is the 5th most populous state and 25th largest state in terms of land area, and is often noted as a microcosm of the entire country. The word \\"Illinois\\" comes from the Algonquin word for \\"tribe of superior men\\". With Chicago in the northeast, small industrial cities and great agricultural productivity in central and northern Illinois, and natural resources like coal, timber, and petroleum in the south, Illinois has a diverse economic base and is a major transportation hub. The Port of Chicago connects the state to other global ports from the Great Lakes, via the Saint Lawrence Seaway, to the Atlantic Ocean, as well as the Great Lakes to the Mississippi River, via the Illinois River. For decades, O'Hare International Airport has been ranked as one of the world's busiest airports.

They consist of the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard. The President of the United States is the military's overall head, and helps form military policy with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), a federal executive department, acting as the principal organ by which military policy is carried out. From the time of its inception, the military played a decisive role in the history of the United States. A sense of national unity and identity was forged as a result of victory in the First Barbary War and the Second Barbary War. Even so, the Founders were suspicious of a permanent military force. It played an important role in the American Civil War, where leading generals on both sides were picked from members of the United States military. Not until the outbreak of World War II did a large standing army become officially established. The National Security Act of 1947, adopted following World War II and during the Cold War's onset, created the modern U.S. military framework; the Act merged previously Cabinet-level Department of War and the Department of the Navy into the National Military Establishment (renamed the Department of Defense in 1949), headed by the Secretary of Defense; and created the Department of the Air Force and National Security Council.  - The Barack Obama Academy of International Studies , also known as Pittsburgh Obama 6 - 12 , is a public school in the East Liberty neighborhood of Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania .

West Virginia is the 41st largest by area, the 38th most populous, and has the second lowest household income of the 50 United States. The capital and largest city is Charleston.  - A head of state (or chief of state) is the public persona that officially represents the national unity and legitimacy of a sovereign state. In developing the current Constitution of France (1958), former French president Charles de Gaulle said the head of state should embody \\"the spirit of the nation\\" (\\"\\"). In some countries, typically those with parliamentary governments, the head of state is a ceremonial figurehead that does not actually guide day-to-day government activities and may not even be empowered to exercise any kind of political authority (e.g., Queen Elizabeth II in the United Kingdom). In other countries, the head of state is also the head of government, such as in the U.S., where the president is both a public figurehead and the actual highest ranking political leader who, in practice, oversees the executive branch.

Hoping to rebound from their road loss to the Patriots, the Steelers went home for a Week 15 duel with the Jacksonville Jaguars.  In the first quarter, Pittsburgh trailed early as Jaguars kicker Josh Scobee nailed a 36-yard field goal.  In the second quarter, the Steelers took the lead as QB Ben Roethlisberger completed an 18-yard TD pass to TE Heath Miller.  Jacksonville regained the lead as QB David Garrard completed a 12-yard TD pass to WR Ernest Wilford. In the third quarter, Pittsburgh fell further behind as Garrard completed a 3-yard TD pass to WR Reggie Williams and a 55-yard TD pass to WR Dennis Northcutt. The extra point attempts on both of these touchdowns failed. In the fourth quarter, the Steelers rallied to tie the game with Roethlisberger completing an 11-yard TD pass to WR Hines Ward and a 30-yard TD pass to WR Nate Washington, with the later being followed by WR Cedric Wilson completing a 2-point conversion pass to WR Santonio Holmes on a trick play.  On the Jaguars' ensuing offensive drive RB Fred Taylor scored on a 12-yard TD run.  The Steelers' next drive ended just a half-yard short on a fourth-down conversion attempt with 41&#160;seconds remaining. With their first home loss of the year, the Steelers fell to 9-5.

Write down the solution for this math problem: Solve 12*m + 6 - 18 = 0 for m.","output":"Sure, let's break down the solution for this equation step by step. The original equation is:  12*m + 6 - 18 = 0 First, we will need to simplify the right side of the equation by combining like terms. 6 - 18 simplifies to -12. This results in the equation: 12*m - 12 = 0 The next step is to get rid of the -12 on the left side of the equation in order to isolate our variable m. In order to do that, we will add 12 to both sides of the equation. This cancels out the -12 on the left side and adds 12 to the right side. The equation now becomes: 12*m = 12 In order to find m, we now need to free it from being multiplied by 12. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 12. As we perform the same operation on both sides of the equation, this maintains the balance of the equation.  m = 12 / 12 The twelve on both sides cancels out, leaving us with: m = 1 So, the solution to the equation 12*m + 6 - 18 = 0 is m = 1. That means that when we substitute 1 for m in the original equation, it should balance both sides of the equation. Checking our work: 12*1 + 6 - 18 = 0 12 + 6 - 18 = 0 -6 + 6 = 0 0 = 0 Our solution is confirmed. m = 1 is indeed the correct solution to this problem."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(CNN) -- As Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad visited the U.N. General Assembly in New York last month, the spotlight was once again on Iran. And true to form, the Iranian president made his fair share of provocative statements for the Western media. But while Ahmadinejad's mercurial rants captured our media's attention, back in Iran a coordinated strategy against the women's movement continued. On the eve of Ahmadinejad's arrival to New York, Shiva Nazar Ahari, a prominent young female defender of human rights, received a heavy sentence of six years in prison on charges including the vague crime of \\"waging war against God\\" -- a convenient catch-all offense for anyone who criticizes the regime and its human rights record. There's no denying it -- Iran's women have had a bad year. Nazar Ahari joins a steadily increasing number of other women's rights activists who are in prison for no greater crime than their attempt to fight for the rights of the women. Hengameh Shahidi, Alieh Eghdam Doust, Bahareh Hedayat and Mahdiyeh Golrou have all been sent to Tehran's notorious Evin Prison on trumped-up charges related to their activism. And while Nobel Peace Prize laureate Shirin Ebadi, arguably the most internationally recognized Iranian women's rights activist, remains unable to safely return to her country, the government is targeting those affiliated with her for arrest and imprisonment, including her lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh and her former aide Jinous Sobhani. Since the 2009 disputed elections and associated government crackdown on the overall reform movement, the government has increasingly targeted women activists. The reasons behind this go well beyond the misogynist nature of Iran's religious leadership. Rather, it is more part of a deliberate and calculated strategy of the Iranian authorities to strike at the heart of the regime's greatest vulnerability -- internal legitimacy with its own people. See more CNN.com opinion articles Iran's government recognizes and fears the broader power of the women activists who have been on the front line of reform in Iran for more than a decade. One can roughly draw an analogy between the women's movement in Iran to movements of religious groups in Burma or Tibet, or the labor \\"solidarity\\" movements in the former Eastern bloc and associated labor-Roman Catholic solidarity in Poland -- all advocating initially for the freedoms of a specific group but which provoked government fears for their transformative power to promote broader human rights progress. While the outside world occasionally reacts to the most egregious manifestations of Iran's repression of women -- such as the international condemnation associated with Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani, an Iranian widow sentenced to stoning on charges of alleged adultery -- these events are often portrayed simply as a consequence of the regime's archaic viewpoint about gender.

Movie title: Executive Action Movie plot: A narrator states that when President Lyndon Johnson was asked about the Kennedy Assassination and the Warren Commission report, he said he doubted the findings of the Commission. The narration ends with the mention that the segment did not run on television and was cut from a program about Johnson, at his own request. At a gathering in June 1963, shadowy industrial, political and former US intelligence figures discuss their growing dissatisfaction with the Kennedy administration. In the plush surroundings of lead conspirator Robert Foster (Robert Ryan), he and the others try to persuade Harold Ferguson (Will Geer), a powerful oil magnate dressed in white, to back their plans for an assassination of Kennedy. He remains unconvinced, saying, \\"I don't like such schemes. They're only tolerable when necessary, and only permissible when they work.\\" James Farrington (Burt Lancaster), a black ops specialist, is also among the group: He shows Ferguson and others that a careful assassination of a U.S. President can be done under certain conditions, and refers to the murders of Abraham Lincoln, James Garfield, and William McKinley as examples, and includes assassination attempts of others including Roosevelt in 1933. He calls this \\"executive action\\". The film cuts to a desert, where a shooting team is doing target practice at a moving object. One of the shooters says they can only guarantee the operation's success by slowing down the target to 15Â miles per hour.

Write an article based on this summary: Steel giant Tata has warned that a new carbon tax announced in the Budget dealt the industry \\"a potentially severe blow\\".","output":"Title: Steel Giant Tata Expresses Concern Over New Carbon Tax Introduction: The steel industry has been significantly impacted by various economic, environmental, and regulatory challenges in recent years. Tata Steel, one of the world's leading steel producers, has voiced serious concerns over the newly announced carbon tax in the Budget. The company has described the tax as \\"a potentially severe blow\\" to the industry, raising questions about the future competitiveness and sustainability of steel production. Step 1: Explain the context of the new carbon tax To understand Tata Steel's concerns, it is important to consider the context of the announced carbon tax. This fiscal measure is part of a broader strategy to combat climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Governments and regulatory bodies across the globe have been implementing various carbon pricing mechanisms to incentivize industries to transition towards cleaner technologies and more sustainable practices. Step 2: Elaborate on Tata Steel's concerns Tata Steel's main concern is the potential negative impact of the carbon tax on the company's financial health. The tax will likely lead to increased production costs, which could affect the company's profit margins. In an industry characterized by tight margins and intense competition, any additional financial burden presents a significant challenge. Furthermore, the company fears that the carbon tax may hinder its ability to compete in global markets, particularly against steel manufacturers from countries with laxer environmental regulations and lower carbon taxes. This could ultimately result in job losses and negatively affect the economic development of regions where Tata Steel operates. Step 3: Address potential implications for the steel industry Tata Steel's concerns point to broader implications for the steel industry as a whole. The additional financial pressures imposed by the carbon tax may; 1. Prompt the industry to search for innovative solutions that reduce greenhouse gas emissions while maintaining cost competitiveness. This could lead to investments in research and development to discover new materials, processes, and technologies. 2. Encourage consolidation and collaboration within the industry, as companies may need to join forces to manage the financial implications of the tax and innovate more effectively. 3. Potentially cause some steel manufacturers to exit the market if they are unable to adapt to the changing regulatory landscape, which could negatively affect local economies and employment opportunities. Step 4: Discuss possible solutions for Tata Steel and the industry  To mitigate the potential negative impacts of the carbon tax, Tata Steel and other steel manufacturers should focus on: 1. Accelerating the development and adoption of cleaner technologies, such as electric arc furnaces and hydrogen-based processes, which can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions in steel production. 2. Collaborating with government and regulatory bodies to ensure that carbon pricing policies are consistent and fair, minimizing the risk of competitiveness imbalances across industries and geographical regions. 3. Embracing circular economy principles by improving recycling processes, extending product lifecycles, and reducing waste generated during the production process. Conclusion: While the new carbon tax announcement poses challenges for Tata Steel and the steel industry as a whole, it is crucial for the long-term sustainability of the sector. By investing in cleaner technologies, embracing circular economy principles, and engaging in constructive dialogue with stakeholders, the industry can address these challenges and contribute to a more sustainable future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Oscar-winning actress Joan Fontaine died Sunday, her longtime friend Noel Beutel said Monday. She was 96. Fontaine died \\"very peacefully\\" in her sleep of natural causes, Beutel said. She was in her Carmel, California, home. She is survived by her older sister, actress Olivia de Havilland -- with whom she had not spoken for decades. Fontaine was born Joan de Beauvoir de Havilland in 1916 in Tokyo, Japan, where her British father was a patent lawyer and teacher. She and her sister moved to Saratoga, California, with their mother in 1919 when her parents separated. Fontaine was a teenager when she began her acting career as Joan Burfield in the 1935 film \\"No More Ladies.\\" She later adopted the stage name Fontaine -- the name of her mother's second husband. She wrote in her 1978 autobiography, \\"No Bed of Roses,\\" that her mother, who was an actress, began encouraging the rivalry with her older sister at an early age. The feud extended to their careers when both sisters were nominated for best actress Oscars in 1942.

The Agencies Confer When they learned a second plane had struck the World Trade Center, nearly everyone in the White House told us, they immediately knew it was not an accident. The Secret Service initiated a number of security enhancements around the White House complex. The officials who issued these orders did not know that there were additional hijacked aircraft, or that one such aircraft was en route to Washington. These measures were precautionary steps taken because of the strikes in New York. The FAA and White House Teleconferences. The FAA, the White House, and the Defense Department each initiated a multiagency teleconference before 9:30. Because none of these teleconferences-at least before 10:00- included the right officials from both the FAA and Defense Department, none succeeded in meaningfully coordinating the military and FAA response to the hijackings. At about 9:20, security personnel at FAA headquarters set up a hijacking teleconference with several agencies, including the Defense Department. The NMCC officer who participated told us that the call was monitored only periodically because the information was sporadic, it was of little value, and there were other important tasks. The FAA manager of the teleconference also remembered that the military participated only briefly before the Pentagon was hit. Both individuals agreed that the teleconference played no role in coordinating a response to the attacks of 9/11. Acting Deputy Administrator Belger was frustrated to learn later in the morning that the military had not been on the call. At the White House, the video teleconference was conducted from the Situation Room by Richard Clarke, a special assistant to the president long involved in counterterrorism. Logs indicate that it began at 9:25 and included the CIA; the FBI; the departments of State, Justice, and Defense; the FAA; and the White House shelter. The FAA and CIA joined at 9:40. The first topic addressed in the White House video teleconference-at about 9:40-was the physical security of the President, the White House, and federal agencies. Immediately thereafter it was reported that a plane had hit the Pentagon. We found no evidence that video teleconference participants had any prior information that American 77 had been hijacked and was heading directly toward Washington.  Question: \\"Why did the FAA and White House teleconferences fail to stop the plane from hitting the Pentagon?\\" Response: \\"The FAA didn't join until 9:40\\" Based on the paragraph, is the response to the question is factually correct?","output":"Yes, the response to the question is factually correct based on the paragraph. The paragraph states that the FAA joined the White House video teleconference at 9:40, and by this time, the Pentagon had already been hit. This indicates that the FAA and White House teleconferences failed to stop the plane from hitting the Pentagon, which could be attributed to the lack of proper coordination and communication between the FAA and Defense Department on the teleconferences. Additionally, the paragraph also mentions that the NMCC officer and the FAA manager both agreed that the hijacking teleconference set up at 9:20 played no role in coordinating a response to the attacks."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Today, I want to tell you a story about a country called Britain where some policemen have found that there are more people from other countries doing bad things than before.  Once upon a time, in 2008, this country had fewer people from different countries doing naughty things. But now, the number of these wrong acts has become two-times bigger! That's like having one chocolate and now having two chocolates - but instead of chocolates, it's people doing things they shouldn't. The policemen in Britain have a special team called the \\"Home Office.\\" They try to send away the people who did bad things back to their own countries. But, it's not an easy job! Sometimes, they can't send away one out of five people.  Imagine, if you have five apples and someone asks you to give all of them away, but you can only give away four apples, that's kind of like what's happening with the Home Office. They can't always send people away who did wrong. Now, there's an important police officer in Britain, and he has an important job to do! He tells everyone that the way they handle wrongdoers needs to change. They need to find better ways to make sure people who did bad things face what they have done. Just like how sometimes in school, the teacher changes the rules to make things better for everyone, the justice system in Britain also has to change its rules to help the country. So, kids, what's the lesson here? We should always learn from our experiences and adapt to become better.

Among them, Antarctica is the most special one. It is a world of snow and ice all year round. China has sent many scientists there. They try to find resources under the icy land and study climate change and sea biology. What do they eat? Scientists don't have many choices on what they eat. About 60% their food is frozen food. It is easy to heat . Meat is common on the menu, while vegetables are not usual. Fresh vegetables are hard to grow in the cold weather. Therefore, people often eat dried and canned vegetables. How do they sleep? In Antarctica, summer lasts from November to March. During this time, Antarctica faces the sun and gets sunlight 24 hours of the day. In order to get some sleep,scientists cover the window with black cloth to make \\"night\\". How do they work? People can wear warm clothes to be against the cold weather, but they can do little with the strong wind. Sometimes, the wind is even stronger than a typhoon. It can easily blow people away. So there are ropes that connect some research stations. People can hold these ropes to keep balance in strong winds. How do they keep in touch with others? There are no cables or Internet on the frozen continent. So mobiles and computers don't work there. Scientists usually use two-way radios to communicate at work. If they want to say hello to family and friends, they can use the satellite phones. Question: What do scientists do in Antarctica? Answer: A:","output":"In Antarctica, scientists carry out various research and exploration activities focusing on understanding the unique environment, resources, climate change, and sea biology. They seek to find resources beneath the frozen land, study the impact of climate change on the Antarctic ecosystem, as well as investigate patterns of marine life and their ecological roles.  Apart from conducting research, scientists in Antarctica must also face and adapt to the challenging living conditions present on the continent. Their diet consists primarily of frozen food, with meat being a common feature and fresh vegetables being scarce due to the difficulty in growing them in the harsh climate.  Sleeping can be challenging as well due to the 24-hour sunlight during the summer months. To create a \\"night\\" environment, they cover their windows with black cloths. Moreover, working in Antarctica requires coping with extremely cold weather and strong winds, at times stronger than typhoons. To maintain balance in such conditions, ropes that connect research stations are used by the scientists. Communicating in Antarctica presents another challenge as there are no cables or internet on the continent. Scientists rely on two-way radios to communicate during their work and use satellite phones to connect with their family and friends back home. Overall, working in Antarctica provides scientists with the opportunity to conduct crucial research and collect valuable data while adapting to the extreme living conditions of this exceptionally cold and isolated part of the world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

It is also used for tool handles and cutlery, such as chopsticks, toothpicks, and other utensils, like the wooden spoon.\\". Can you tell me what it is? Answer:","output":"Wood has played a significant role in dental hygiene throughout history, primarily through the use of wooden toothpicks and chew sticks. In the context of the statement provided, the answer to \\"How does wood contribute to dental hygiene?\\" can be found in the mention of toothpicks and utensils. Wooden toothpicks are small, thin, pointed tools used to remove food debris from between teeth, which helps in maintaining oral cleanliness. When used properly, toothpicks can support gum health and prevent dental problems such as cavities and periodontal disease. Another wood-based dental hygiene instrument is the chew stick, also known as a miswak stick or neem stick. These natural toothbrushes have been used for centuries in different cultures, usually sourced from trees with antibacterial and teeth-cleaning properties. Users chew on one end of the stick until the fibers loosen, then brush their teeth with the softened fibers. Chew sticks help to clean teeth, reduce plaque build-up, and freshen breath, all while having a gentle, natural abrasive effect.

Mary decided to grow hydroponic lettuce on her farm and hired Carrie to design the system.","output":"As Carrie began planning the hydroponic lettuce farm, she decided to take a step-by-step approach to ensure the design met Mary's expectations along with being sustainable and efficient. Step 1: Assessing Space and Location Carrie surveyed Mary's farm to understand the available space and the optimal location for the hydroponic system. She considered factors such as sunlight exposure, accessibility for farmworkers, and proximity to water and electricity sources. Carrie noted these aspects and decided to set up the hydroponic system in a corner of the farm that had ample sunlight and was close to a water source. Step 2: Selecting the Hydroponic System Carrie researched different hydroponic systems to determine the best one for growing lettuce. She considered factors like cost, scalability, and ease of maintenance. After evaluating various options, she decided on a Nutrient Film Technique (NFT) system, as it was well-suited for growing leafy greens like lettuce and allowed for efficient use of water and nutrients. Step 3: Preparing the Budget and Procuring Materials Carrie prepared a detailed budget for the project, including the cost of construction materials, water, nutrients, seeds, and other necessary supplies. She also took labor costs into account and presented her budget proposal to Mary for approval. Once the budget was agreed upon, Carrie identified reliable suppliers for procuring all the necessary materials and placed an order. Step 4: Constructing the System With the help of a skilled labor team, Carrie started constructing the NFT hydroponic system. She ensured the channels were placed at a slight angle to facilitate the flow of nutrient-rich water over the plant roots. She also installed a filtration system, pumps, and air stones to maintain optimal water and nutrient circulation and aeration. Step 5: Planting and Monitoring After thoroughly cleaning and sanitizing the system, Carrie planted lettuce seeds in small rockwool cubes and placed them in the NFT channels. She closely monitored the growth of the lettuce and adjusted nutrient levels, water pH, and temperature as needed to promote healthy and rapid growth. Step 6: Harvesting and Maintenance Carrie trained Mary and her farmworkers in the proper techniques for harvesting the hydroponic lettuce, ensuring that the plants were not damaged in the process. She also educated them on routine maintenance tasks, such as cleaning the system, replacing water, and replenishing nutrients, to ensure the longevity of the hydroponic system. Carrie's thoughtful and strategic approach to designing the hydroponic lettuce farm proved successful, as Mary's farm soon became known for producing some of the freshest, tastiest, and most sustainably grown lettuce in the community. Not only did this endeavor generate a new income stream for Mary, but it also inspired other local farmers to adopt similar hydroponic systems on their own farms."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

But without hefty carrier subsidies, will they ever be able to crack the U.S. market? Are American consumers ready for pricier cell phones that come without two-year wireless contracts? There's no question that when it comes to features, Nokia and Sony Ericsson's new U.S.-ready phones can easily compete against the hottest new phones on the market. Nokia's N97, a touch screen phone that supports both 3G and Wi-Fi, has a 5-megapixel camera and 32GB of memory. It's a clear competitor to the new Apple iPhone 3G S and the Palm Pre. The Sony Ericsson W995a, also a 3G and Wi-Fi enabled phone, comes with an 8.1-megapixel camera, a brilliant display screen, a good media player and features such as stereo Bluetooth, and GPS. In terms of features and functionality, this phone could easily compete with other high-end feature phones like the LG enV3, which is sold by Verizon Wireless or the Samsung Memoir T929, sold for T-Mobile USA's network. But even though these phones may have the features to compete, they're not sold through a wireless operator, which means that they are not subsidized, making them too expensive for most mainstream customers. The N97's suggested retail price is 700, and Sony plans to start selling the W995a for 600. Meanwhile AT&T charges 99 for the 8GB iPhone 3G, 199 for the 16GB iPhone 3GS, and 299 for the 32GB iPhone 3GS. In exchange for the subsidy, AT&T requires that customers sign a two-year service contract. The price of the service, which includes voice and data services, is a minimum of 70 per month. But regardless of whether a device is subsidized, users will have to purchase some kind of voice and/or data plan, depending on the type of device they buy. \\"In the U.S. market, price is a huge factor in determining which phones people buy,\\" said Will Stofego, an analyst with the market research firm IDC. \\"Why pay 500 or more for a phone when you can get an iPhone for 100? Of course you have to agree to the two-year service plan, but I think that's a trade-off most consumers are OK with.\\" Up until recently, unlocked phones--handsets that can be used on multiple carrier networks--were only available in \\"gray\\" markets where Americans bought phones from overseas. Now manufacturers are selling them on their Web sites, in their own retail stores, and through some big retail chains, such as Best Buy. Nokia has opened several retail stores in the U.S. And Sony Ericsson sells unlocked phones through Sony Electronic retail channels. As part of their push to address the U.S. market, Nokia and Sony Ericsson are also making sure that the phones they sell in the U.S. operate in the frequency bands used by AT&T and T-Mobile, the two main GSM carriers in the U.S. While these operators have built GSM networks just like carriers in Europe and parts of Asia, not all GSM networks operate on the same frequency, which means that some unlocked GSM phones bought in Europe or Asia won't work in the U.S. on a GSM network. Another benefit to buying a U.S.-friendly unlocked phone is that Sony Ericsson is now offering warranties for customers who buy their U.S. unlocked phones through a Sony retail channel. The company doesn't offer a warranty for phones designed for other countries and brought to the U.S. through the gray market. Roadblocks for unlocked phones Despite these efforts to create a stronger retail presence for these unlocked phones, the market remains small. In the U.S., only about 5 percent of the phones sold each year are unlocked and available from somewhere other than a carrier. This differs greatly from other markets. Worldwide, unlocked phones account for about 50 percent of phones sold. In Asia, about 80 percent of cell phones are sold independently of a carrier. And in Europe, roughly 70 percent of cell phones are sold unlocked. There are several reasons for this difference. For one, two of the four big nationwide U.S. cell phone operators in the U.S. use CDMA, which does not use SIM cards that can be interchanged between phones. Most of the world's cell phone carriers use GSM, which does allow for SIM cards. And because people buy unlocked phones in order to swap out SIM cards to use on other carrier networks, phones made by manufacturers such as Nokia and Sony Ericsson, which have concentrated efforts on developing GSM phones, can only be used on two of the big four nationwide wireless networks in the U.S.: AT&T and T-Mobile. But the biggest reason that unlocked phones haven't taken off in the U.S. is that they are much more expensive to buy than locked phones that are subsidized and typically require a two-year service contract. That said, Nokia and Sony Ericsson see opportunity in the U.S. market. And the consumers they're targeting are unlikely to be buying their first smartphone. Steve Medina, product and business manager for Sony Ericsson unlocked phones, says that unlocked phones in the U.S. appeal to a very niche market of tech-savvy consumers. \\"Unlocked phones aren't for every consumer,\\" he said. \\"They are really for the phone junkies; the geeks. It might seem crazy to some people that someone would drop 600 or 700 on a phone. But you'd be surprised at how many actually do.\\" Medina said a lot of the people buying unlocked phones either frequently travel internationally, or they have lived in Europe and Asia where people typically buy unlocked phones at full retail price. For these consumers, Medina says the benefits of an unlocked phone far outweigh the hefty price tag. The biggest benefit of an unlocked phone is that users can simply pop in SIM card to get service. And unlike GSM phones bought through U.S. operators, these phones don't require a special unlock code to be able to swap SIM cards. Medina says that's an important distinction, because when wireless subscribers from AT&T and T-Mobile unlock their phones, the locking software is still on the phone. The code that is used to unlock the device simply overrides that software. What this means is that when phones are updated, they can be relocked, forcing consumers to once again override the lock code. Another big benefit of buying an unlocked phone is that all the features that the manufacturer has included on the phone will work. U.S. cell phone carriers sometimes disable some functionality on phones that they sell. And with many phones, they often integrate their own software and branding onto the phone. But as Medina points out, unlocked phones are not for everyone. Aside from the cost, unlocked phones are often more difficult to set up. Users must configure their messaging functions and Internet functionality on their phones. Phones sold through carriers are already pre-configured for these functions. And when a carrier upgrades its network and sends out an automated update to phones on the network, unlocked users must handle the updates on their own. And if there is ever a problem with the phone or the service, an AT&T or T-Mobile service representative may not be able to help because he or she isn't trained to deal with these specific phones. While Sony Ericsson's Medina acknowledges that it's unlikely that the unlocked market will grow with respect to the overall cell phone market in the U.S. right now, he believes that eventually more U.S. consumers will buy unlocked phones. \\"We believe that at some point, the U.S. market will become more like the European and Asian markets where unlocked phones are the norm,\\" he said. \\"The U.S. wireless market will eventually evolve from a carrier-led market to one that is more open. And consumers will select a phone and then select a carrier.\\" But as long as mobile phone carriers continue to subsidize handsets, most consumers will opt for a subsidized phone rather than paying for a non-subsidized phone. \\"The problem in the U.S. is that people have been trained to buy on price,\\" Stofega said. Government intervention looming? But not all hope is lost for Sony Ericsson and Nokia in their quest to crack open the unlocked cell phone market in the U.S. These companies may get a little help from the government. Congress and the Federal Communications Commission are already investigating exclusive deals made between wireless carriers and handset makers. And some officials are even questioning the carrier practice of disabling certain features. It's difficult to say if either the FCC or Congress will actually do something to limit this practice, which could help open up the unlocked market. While a move like this would certainly increase choice for consumers, it could also drive up costs for consumers. Given this consequences and the fact that the phone companies have a strong lobbying organization in Washington, it seems unlikely that government intervention will happen any time soon. That said, the government has imposed unpopular rules on the phone companies previously. For example, wireless phone companies are now required to allow consumers to take their phone numbers with them when they switch carriers, which was a move that was initially highly unpopular with carriers. The best solution for cracking the unlocked phone market is for phone manufacturers to develop new business models that will keep consumer costs low, but still reward carriers and phone manufacturers. Medina suggests that Sony Ericsson could subsidize the cost of its phones by charging for mobile games and applications. This is a model that has worked well in the game console market. And there are already indications that consumers are hungry for mobile applications. The success of Apple's App Store is proof of that. But again price is a big factor in the success of such a plan. Through the App Store, consumers are already being conditioned to get applications for free or for 99 cents. \\"Right now unlocked phones will likely not appeal to the mainstream market,\\" Sony Ericsson's Medina admits. \\"Whenever you have a subsidized model, it is always going to be cheaper to buy a subsidized product. But there are different ways to address this, and we think right now we have a strong offering for hard core cell phone enthusiasts, who want the flexibility of an unlocked phone. But we are also looking at other revenue streams to subsidize unlocked phones.\\" © 2009 CBS Interactive Inc. All rights reserved.

In 1841, Solomon Northup is a free African-American man working as a violinist, living with his wife and two children in Saratoga Springs, New York. Two white men, Brown and Hamilton, offer him short-term employment as a musician if he will travel with them to Washington, D.C. However, once they arrive they drug Northup and deliver him to a slave pen run by a man named Burch. Northup proclaims that he is a free man, only to be savagely beaten with a wooden paddle and then a leather belt. Northup is later shipped to New Orleans along with other captive African Americans. He is told by the others that if he wants to survive in the South, he must adapt to being a slave and not tell anyone he is a free man. A slave trader named Theophilus Freeman gives Northup the identity of \\"Platt\\", a runaway slave from Georgia, and sells him to plantation owner William Ford. Ford takes a liking to Northup and gives him a violin. However, tension grows between Northup and plantation carpenter John Tibeats which ends with Northup savagely beating and whipping Tibeats. Tibeats and his group try to hang Northup. Although they are not successful, Northup is left on the noose for hours before he is finally cut down. To save Northup's life, Ford sells him to another slave owner named Edwin Epps. In the process, Northup attempts to explain that he is actually a free man, but Ford tells him he is too afraid and that he cannot help him now.

Process:  - A forest fire starts - The trees and plants burn - The animals lose their homes - If the animals can not escape, they may die from smoke inhalation - The plants that provide food are gone - The animals have little to eat -   Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there are fewer regulations restricting humans from starting campfires in forested areas happens, how will it affect fewer animals die from smoke inhalation.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis in this case can be defined as the effect of fewer regulations restricting humans from starting campfires in forested areas. We will investigate whether this supposed perturbation has any direct or indirect effect on the process, with a specific focus on the potential for fewer animals to die from smoke inhalation. As fewer regulations are put in place to prevent humans from starting campfires in forested areas, it can reasonably be assumed that the number of campfires, and therefore the risk of forest fires, may significantly increase. Forest fires, particularly those that are caused by human activity, can have a wide-ranging impact on the environment, including damage to the habitats of various animal species. Consequentially, an increase in forest fires, either in frequency or severity, can lead to a higher number of animals being affected, including an increased likelihood of death from smoke inhalation. One direct effect of the increase in forest fires caused by lax regulations on campfires is an increase in the number of trees and plants that are burned during these events. This destruction of vegetation not only contributes to the loss of natural habitats for many animal species but also leads to the loss of food sources, both for herbivores that rely on plant life and carnivores that feed on other animals in the ecosystem. In turn, this can force animals to venture further away from their natural habitats in search of food, placing them in direct danger of fires as they traverse these areas or increase their risk of encountering other dangers such as predators or loss of cover from hazards. Another indirect effect of the increase in forest fires due to fewer regulations on campfires can be seen in the loss of shelter and protection for animals living within these environments. The rapid spread of fires through thick forest can lead to the widespread damage or destruction of nests, dens, burrows, and other forms of shelter - many of which may not be easily relocated or reconstructed. This loss of shelter can leave animals more susceptible to predation, disease, and environmental hazards, further increasing their likelihood of death from smoke inhalation and other causes. Moreover, animals may experience heightened stress levels due to the increased frequency and severity of fires, as well as the loss of their natural habitats. Such stress can impact their overall health, making them more susceptible to various illnesses, thus indirectly increasing the chances of dying from smoke inhalation or other issues related to forest fires. In conclusion, the supposed perturbation of fewer regulations restricting humans from starting campfires in forested areas potentially has both direct and indirect effects on the process. Primarily, it can lead to an increase in forest fires, through the destruction of habitats, food sources, and shelter for animals. This increases the likelihood of animals dying from smoke inhalation and other related causes. Furthermore, the stress associated with the increased frequency of forest fires due to lax regulations and the loss of natural habitats can weaken animals' health and susceptibility to diseases, further endangering their survival. Overall, this perturbation is expected to have a negative impact on the survival of animals within affected ecosystems."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Information:  - Psychotherapy is the use of psychological methods, particularly when based on regular personal interaction, to help a person change and overcome problems in desired ways. Psychotherapy aims to improve an individual's well-being and mental health, to resolve or mitigate troublesome behaviors, beliefs, compulsions, thoughts, or emotions, and to improve relationships and social skills. Certain psychotherapies are considered evidence-based for treating some diagnosed mental disorders.  - The ear is the organ of hearing and, in mammals, balance. In mammals, the ear is usually described as having three partsthe outer ear, middle ear and the inner ear. The outer ear consists of the pinna and the ear canal. Since the outer ear is the only visible portion of the ear in most animals, the word \\"ear\\" often refers to the external part alone. The middle ear includes the tympanic cavity and the three ossicles. The inner ear sits in the bony labyrinth, and contains structures which are key to several senses: the semicircular canals, which enable balance and eye tracking when moving; the utricle and saccule, which enable balance when stationary; and the cochlea, which enables hearing. The ears of vertebrates are placed somewhat symmetrically on either side of the head, an arrangement that aids sound localisation.  - Latin (Latin: ) is a classical language belonging to the Italic branch of the Indo-European languages. The Latin alphabet is derived from the Etruscan and Greek alphabets.  - Science is a systematic enterprise that builds and organizes knowledge in the form of testable explanations and predictions about the universe.  - Health is the level of functional and metabolic efficiency of a living organism. In humans it is the ability of individuals or communities to adapt and self-manage when facing physical, mental or social changes. The World Health Organization (WHO) defined health in its broader sense in its 1948 constitution as \\"a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.\\" This definition has been subject to controversy, in particular as lacking operational value, the ambiguity in developing cohesive health strategies, and because of the problem created by use of the word \\"complete\\". Other definitions have been proposed, among which a recent definition that correlates health and personal satisfaction.  - A disease is a particular abnormal condition, a disorder of a structure or function, that affects part or all of an organism. The study of disease is called pathology which includes the causal study of etiology. Disease is often construed as a medical condition associated with specific symptoms and signs. It may be caused by external factors such as pathogens, or it may be caused by internal dysfunctions particularly of the immune system such as an immunodeficiency, or a hypersensitivity including allergies and autoimmunity.  - Medicine (British English ; American English ) is the science and practice of the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of disease. The word \\"medicine\\" is derived from Latin \\"medicus\\", meaning \\"a physician\\". Medicine encompasses a variety of health care practices evolved to maintain and restore health by the prevention and treatment of illness. Contemporary medicine applies biomedical sciences, biomedical research, genetics, and medical technology to diagnose, treat, and prevent injury and disease, typically through pharmaceuticals or surgery, but also through therapies as diverse as psychotherapy, external splints and traction, medical devices, biologics, and ionizing radiation, amongst others.  - A gene is a locus (or region) of DNA which is made up of nucleotides and is the molecular unit of heredity. The transmission of genes to an organism's offspring is the basis of the inheritance of phenotypic traits. Most biological traits are under the influence of polygenes (many different genes) as well as geneenvironment interactions. Some genetic traits are instantly visible, such as eye colour or number of limbs, and some are not, such as blood type, risk for specific diseases, or the thousands of basic biochemical processes that comprise life.  - Diagnosis is the identification of the nature and cause of a certain phenomenon. Diagnosis is used in many different disciplines with variations in the use of logic, analytics, and experience to determine \\"cause and effect\\". In systems engineering and computer science, it is typically used to determine the causes of symptoms, mitigations, and solutions.  - A medical device is any instrument, apparatus, appliance, software, material, or other articlewhether used alone or in combination, including the software intended by its manufacturer to be used specifically for diagnostic and/or therapeutic purposes and necessary for its proper applicationintended by the manufacturer to be used for human beings for the purpose of:  - Surgery (from the \\"cheirourgik\\" (composed of , \\"hand\\", and , \\"work\\"), via , meaning \\"hand work\\") is an ancient medical specialty that uses operative manual and instrumental techniques on a patient to investigate and/or treat a pathological condition such as disease or injury, to help improve bodily function or appearance or to repair unwanted ruptured areas (for example, a perforated ear drum).  - In medicine , a nebulizer or nebuliser ( see spelling differences ) is a drug delivery device used to administer medication in the form of a mist inhaled into the lungs . Nebulizers are commonly used for the treatment of cystic fibrosis , asthma , COPD and other respiratory diseases .

Question: Process:  - Aluminium cans are put into a recycling bin - Aluminium cans are then collected and taken to a treatment plant - At the treatment plant the aluminium is sorted and cleaned - Readied for reprocessing - The aluminum cans go through a re-melt process - Turned into molten aluminium - The molten aluminum is made into large blocks called ingots - The ingots are sent to mills and are rolled out into thin sheets - The rolls are ready to be made into new aluminum products.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the rollers in the plant stop working happens, how will it affect MORE aluminum cans being recycled.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of the rollers in the plant stopping working does have an effect on the process of aluminum can recycling, both directly and indirectly. The rollers play a critical role in transforming the aluminum ingots into thin sheets, which are then used to create new aluminum products, including cans. If the rollers stop working, it causes a disruption in this vital step of the recycling process, leading to a series of consequences that ultimately impact the rate of aluminum can recycling and production. The direct effect of this perturbation is that the aluminum ingots can no longer be rolled into thin sheets at the plant. This means the ingots cannot be further processed into usable forms, leading to a bottleneck in the recycling process. Consequently, there will be a delay or temporary halt in the production of new aluminum products, including cans. Additionally, the inability to process the ingots into thin sheets could cause a buildup of raw materials at the mills. If the problem persists, there may not be enough storage space for these materials, leading to inefficiencies in the recycling process. The treatment plants would also be affected, as they would have to hold onto their processed aluminum rather than sending it to the mills for further production. In turn, this could reduce the overall efficiency and capacity of the recycling industry, leading to less aluminum cans being recycled over time. Furthermore, the indirect impact of this perturbation might also affect the entire supply chain, from can manufacturers to end consumers. The lack of readily available aluminum sheets could lead to shortages and delays in the production of new aluminum products, which may result in increased costs for manufacturers and higher consumer prices. This could potentially discourage consumers from using and recycling aluminum cans, thereby reducing the overall demand for aluminum recycling services. In conclusion, the perturbation of rollers stopping working at the recycling plant has both direct and indirect effects on the process of recycling aluminum cans. This disruption can result in a bottleneck in the recycling system, causing inefficiencies and negatively impacting the entire supply chain. If not addressed promptly, the situation can lead to a decline in aluminum can recycling and associated environmental benefits. It is vital that recycling plants maintain and monitor their equipment to mitigate the risk of disruptions, ensuring a smooth and efficient process for recycling and producing aluminum products."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: Janet Damita Jo Jackson (born May 16, 1966) is an American singer, songwriter, dancer, and actress. Known for sonically innovative, socially conscious and sexually provocative records, and elaborate stage shows, she has been a prominent figure in popular culture for over thirty years. The youngest child of the Jackson family, she began her career with the variety television series The Jacksons in 1976 and went on to appear in other television shows throughout the 1970s and early 1980s, including Good Times and Fame. After signing a recording contract with A&M Records in 1982, she became a pop icon following the release of her third studio album Control (1986). Context: Jackson began recording her ninth studio album, 20 Y.O., in 2005. She recorded with producers Dupri, Jam and Lewis for several months during the following year. The album's title was a reference to the two decades since the release of her breakthrough album Control, representing the album's \\"celebration of the joyful liberation and history-making musical style.\\"  To promote the album, Jackson appeared in various magazines, and performed on the Today Show and Billboard Awards. Jackson's Us Weekly cover, revealing her slim figure after heavy media focus was placed on her fluctuations in weight, became the magazine's best-selling issue in history. 20 Y.O. was released in September 2006 and debuted at number two on the Billboard 200. The album received mixed reviews, with multiple critics chastising the production and involvement of Jermaine Dupri. Rolling Stone disagreed with the album's reference to Control, saying \\"If we were her, we wouldn't make the comparison.\\"  Jackson's airplay and music channel blacklist remained persistent, massively affecting her chart performance and exposure. However, lead single \\"Call on Me\\", which featured rapper Nelly, peaked at number twenty-five on the Hot 100, number one on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, and number six in the United Kingdom. The video for the album's second single, \\"So Excited\\", was directed by Joseph Kahn and portrayed Jackson's clothes disappearing through a complex dance routine.  20 Y.O. was certified platinum by the RIAA and sold 1.2 million worldwide, also receiving a Grammy nomination for Best Contemporary R&B Album. After the album's release, Dupri was condemned for his production and misguidance of the album, and subsequently was removed from his position at Virgin Records. Slant Magazine stated, \\"After promising a return to Janet's dance-pop origins, [Dupri] opted to aim for urban audiences, a colossal mistake that cost Dupri his job and, probably, Janet her deal with Virgin.\\"  Jackson was ranked the seventh richest woman in the entertainment industry by Forbes, having amassed a fortune of over 150 million. In 2007, she starred opposite Tyler Perry as a psychotherapist in the film Why Did I Get Married?. It became her third consecutive film to open at number one at the box office, grossing 60 million in total.

There is no question why their pizza wins Best of Las Vegas  nearly every year.  Having said that, the family and I went to try the newest edition located in the northwest off the 95 between the 215 exit and Durango.  The experience was less than stellar overall.    The ambiance and the appearance of the new Metro is wonderful.  It is very open and inviting, and the seating is well spaced.  The decor is great, with a mix of old-world Italy and sports banners hanging in the bar area.  After being seated, we were greeted in a fairly good amount of time (within about 5 minutes) and the server started out on point.  That is where the point became a jagged line.  After our drink orders were in, we asked for a kid's cup for our son, and never saw it (after asking two additional times for it).  The lack of attention continued for us throughout the meal.  I did run to the restroom to verify that I was, in fact, still visible to the human eye just in case there was an anomaly, but alas I was not transparent.  The orders were finally taken and the food did arrive to the table in a more than reasonable timeframe.   The food is still exceptional, and even though this is a new location the quality is still very much the same as I would expect from Metro.  The service, on the other hand, continued to deteriorate at an alarming rate.  After receiving our food.  We did not see our server again until nearly 20 minutes later.  We had to ask another server for a refill of our beverages, and there was never a follow-up from our server until that 20 minute mark.  When she did finally show up, my wife asked for to-go containers and a slice of their carrot cake for our son.  The boxes did show up, but we never saw the carrot cake, or even the check for that matter!  20 more minutes passed and the server was seen checking on other tables and completely ignored us.    This was the final straw.  We called the manager over to express our frustration and concern over the missing cake that our son was now asking every 3 seconds for (never keep a 5-year-old away from his dessert).  The manager was very courteous and did state that he had noticed the poor service (which is the first concern I have.  If he is aware of the poor service, why wasn't he out there to begin with?) and wanted to make sure that we were taken care of.  This was a very disappointing trip and one that I will have to think hard about returning to this location for.

Write an article based on this \\"A council's education service has been strongly criticised by watchdogs.\\"","output":"Title: Watchdogs Criticize Council's Education Service - What Went Wrong and What Needs to Change Introduction A recent investigation conducted by independent watchdogs has revealed that a local council's education service has been met with strong criticism, shedding light on significant shortcomings in the system. Various factors, including inadequate resources, inefficiency in management, and poor communication channels, have contributed to the critique. The council under scrutiny must now urgently address these serious issues in order to improve the quality of education and fulfill its responsibility to the community. The Role of Watchdogs in Safeguarding Education Standards Independent watchdogs play a critical role in ensuring that education services maintain stringent standards of quality and efficiency. These entities scrutinize the functioning of councils, schools, and other institutions to detect deficiencies in their systems, enabling corrective action to be taken. In this instance, the council's poor performance in education has been brought to light by the diligent work of these watchdogs. Inadequate Resources and Its Impact on Education One of the primary concerns raised by the watchdogs in their critique of the council's education service is the severe lack of resources. Funding shortages create a detrimental chain reaction that impairs the overall learning experience for students. For instance, insufficient funds result in a dearth of teaching supplies, outdated materials, and inadequate technology, hindering the students' ability to learn effectively. Moreover, poorly maintained facilities reflect poorly on a council's capacity to foster a safe and conducive learning environment. Neglected repairs and outdated infrastructures pose potential dangers to both students and staff, consequently leading to a decrease in motivation and engagement. To address this issue, the council must seek ways to increase funding, enabling the necessary improvements to be made. Inefficiency in Management As highlighted by the watchdogs, the council's education service has also been plagued by issues in management. An ineffective top-down approach, characterized by weak or inconsistent decision-making, can have a considerable impact on the education system as a whole. Poorly managed services tend to suffer from high staff turnover, unclear objectives, and minimal accountability. To resolve such a crisis in management, the council must reassess its strategies and foster a culture of transparency and collaboration among stakeholders in the education system. In addition, establishing clear lines of communication and introducing performance metrics can encourage an atmosphere of accountability and responsibility. Communication Breakdowns within the Council's Education Service Watchdogs have identified that communication breakdowns within the council's education service have contributed to the subpar performance of the system. Poor communication channels among school administrators, teachers, and parents can cause confusion, missed opportunities, and mismanagement of resources. Moreover, the lack of effective communication between the council and the education service staff can result in delays or inconsistencies in implementing crucial policies. In order to rectify these communication problems, the council must ensure that regular meetings are held to facilitate open discussions and address concerns. Furthermore, creating online platforms for sharing information and updates can greatly improve communication and foster collaboration among staff members and the wider community. Conclusion The strong criticism put forth by watchdogs of the council's education service emphasizes the immediate need for systemic reform. Addressing inadequate resources, inefficiencies in management, and communication breakdowns, will not only improve the quality of education but also fortify the council's commitment to enhancing the overall well-being of the community. As we entrust our future generations' education to the council, it is crucial that they heed the recommendations provided by the watchdogs and prioritize long-term, sustainable solutions for the betterment of their education service."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The person responsible for this demonstration is a chatty individual, preparing and giving out samples of a Weight Watchers (WW) strawberry mousse, accompanied by a couple of grapes. The narrator also shows their concern regarding the use of dairy and aspartame in the preparation of the mousse. As for the possible outcomes involving the narrator and the free samples, we can consider the following scenarios: 1. The narrator chooses to avoid the free sample due to their concerns about dairy and aspartame. In this case, they will continue with their work at the flower display, perhaps observing or interacting with the chatty person, but not indulging in the free samples being offered. The narrator might consider the potential health concerns or dietary restrictions that prevent them from trying the freebie and decide that it is not worth the risk. 2. The narrator decides to try the free sample despite their reservations. They might do this out of curiosity, to be polite, or maybe even because they get along well with the chatty person. After consuming the sample, the narrator could have various reactions, such as enjoying the taste but still being concerned about the ingredients, experiencing an adverse reaction due to their intolerance or sensitivity to dairy or aspartame, or realizing that their concerns were unfounded and the free sample was harmless to them. 3. The narrator might engage in a conversation with the chatty person, questioning the use of dairy and aspartame in the mousse. This interaction might lead to an educational moment, where the chatty person explains the reasons behind the choices or suggests alternative products that might be more suitable for the narrator's dietary preferences. This could lead to a more informed decision on whether or not to try the free sample, or it might encourage the narrator to look for other similar products that cater to their particular dietary needs. In summary, the outcome for the narrator and the free sample will highly depend on their personal preferences, priorities, and inclinations when it comes to trying out the food. The narrator's concerns and reactions can influence their decision and the overall experience with the product demonstration. Regardless of the chosen scenario, this situation highlights the importance of being aware of and understanding the ingredients and potential allergens in food, especially for those with dietary restrictions or preferences."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Information:  - Induction heating is the process of heating an electrically conducting object (usually a metal) by electromagnetic induction, through heat generated in the object by eddy currents (also called Foucault currents). An induction heater consists of an electromagnet, and an electronic oscillator that passes a high-frequency alternating current (AC) through the electromagnet. The rapidly alternating magnetic field penetrates the object, generating electric currents inside the conductor called eddy currents. The eddy currents flowing through the resistance of the material heat it by Joule heating. In ferromagnetic (and ferrimagnetic) materials like iron, heat may also be generated by magnetic hysteresis losses. The frequency of current used depends on the object size, material type, coupling (between the work coil and the object to be heated) and the penetration depth.  - Thermionic emission is the thermally induced flow of charge carriers from a surface or over a potential-energy barrier. This occurs because the thermal energy given to the carrier overcomes the work function of the material. The charge carriers can be electrons or ions, and in older literature are sometimes referred to as \\"thermions\\". After emission, a charge that is equal in magnitude and opposite in sign to the total charge emitted is initially left behind in the emitting region. But if the emitter is connected to a battery, the charge left behind is neutralized by charge supplied by the battery as the emitted charge carriers move away from the emitter, and finally the emitter will be in the same state as it was before emission.  - An oven is a thermally insulated chamber used for the heating, baking or drying of a substance, and most commonly used for cooking. Kilns and furnaces are special-purpose ovens, used in pottery and metalworking, respectively.  - A fuel is any material that can be made to react with other substances so that it releases chemical or nuclear energy as heat or to be used for work. The concept was originally applied solely to those materials capable of releasing chemical energy but has since also been applied to other sources of heat energy such as nuclear energy (via nuclear fission and nuclear fusion).  - An electric arc or arc discharge is an electrical breakdown of a gas that produces an ongoing electrical discharge. The current through a normally nonconductive medium such as air produces a plasma; the plasma may produce visible light. An arc discharge is characterized by a lower voltage than a glow discharge, and it relies on thermionic emission of electrons from the electrodes supporting the arc. An archaic term is voltaic arc, as used in the phrase \\"voltaic arc lamp\\".  - Combustion or burning is a high-temperature exothermic redox chemical reaction between a fuel (the reductant) and an oxidant, usually atmospheric oxygen, that produces oxidized, often gaseous products, in a mixture termed as smoke. Combustion in a fire produces a flame, and the heat produced can make combustion self-sustaining. Combustion is often a complicated sequence of elementary radical reactions. Solid fuels, such as wood, first undergo endothermic pyrolysis to produce gaseous fuels whose combustion then supplies the heat required to produce more of them. Combustion is often hot enough that light in the form of either glowing or a flame is produced. A simple example can be seen in the combustion of hydrogen and oxygen into water vapor, a reaction commonly used to fuel rocket engines. This reaction releases 242 kJ/mol of heat and reduces the enthalpy accordingly (at constant temperature and pressure):  - A glow discharge is a plasma formed by the passage of electric current through a low-pressure gas. It is created by applying a voltage between two metal electrodes in a glass tube containing gas. When the voltage exceeds a certain value called the striking voltage, the gas in the tube ionizes, becoming a plasma, and begins conducting electricity, causing it to glow with a colored light. The color depends on the gas used. Glow discharge is widely used as a source of light in devices such as neon lights, fluorescent lamps, and plasma-screen televisions. Analyzing the light produced by spectroscopy can reveal much about the atomic interactions in the gas, so glow discharge is used in plasma physics and analytical chemistry. It is also used in the surface treatment technique called sputtering.  - Electrical breakdown or dielectric breakdown is a long reduction in the resistance of an electrical insulator when the voltage applied across it exceeds the breakdown voltage. This results in the insulator becoming electrically conductive. Electrical breakdown may be a momentary event (as in an electrostatic discharge), or may lead to a discontinuous arc charge if protective devices fail to interrupt the current in a low power circuit.  - A furnace is a device used for high-temperature heating. The name derives from Greek word \\"fornax\\", which means oven. The heat energy to fuel a furnace may be supplied directly by fuel combustion, by electricity such as the electric arc furnace, or through induction heating in induction furnaces.  - An electric arc furnace ( EAF ) is a furnace that heats charged material by means of an electric arc . Industrial arc furnaces range in size from small units of approximately one ton capacity ( used in foundries for producing cast iron products ) up to about 400 ton units used for secondary steelmaking . Arc furnaces used in research laboratories and by dentists may have a capacity of only a few dozen grams . Industrial electric arc furnace temperatures can be up to 1,800 ° C ( 3,272 ° F ) , while laboratory units can exceed 3,000 ° C ( 5,432 ° F ) . Arc furnaces differ from induction furnaces in that the charge material is directly exposed to an electric arc , and the current in the furnace terminals passes through the charged material .  - An induction furnace is an electrical furnace in which the heat is applied by induction heating of metal.  Induction furnace capacities range from less than one kilogram to one hundred tonnes capacity and are used to melt iron and steel, copper, aluminium and precious metals.  - An arc lamp or arc light is a lamp that produces light by an electric arc (also called a voltaic arc). The carbon arc light, which consists of an arc between carbon electrodes in air, invented by Humphry Davy in the first decade of the 1800s, was the first practical electric light. It was widely used starting in the 1870s for street and large building lighting until it was superseded by the incandescent light in the early 20th century. It continued in use in more specialized applications where a high intensity point light source was needed, such as searchlights and movie projectors until after World War II. The carbon arc lamp is now obsolete for all of these purposes and is only still made for very specialized purposes where a high intensity UV source is needed.

Title: Danny, the Champion of the World Movie plot: It is 1955, somewhere in rural England. Wealthy Victor Hazell owns a vast estate, and drives his expensive car proudly around it to survey his domain. He drives past several signs that show he has acquired much of his property recently, by buying out surrounding smallholdings. There are hundreds of prime pheasants wandering around his property, and as he drives along his two gamekeepers, Rabbetts and Springer, wish him a good morning. However, he does not acknowledge their presence, throws his cigar out the window and drives on proudly, much to their disgust.Hazell's good mood is ruined when he stops on a hillside and spots, in the distance, the garage and filling station owned by William Smith and his nine-year-old son, Danny. Hazell gets out of his car and peers at the structure through a set of field glasses, watching Danny fill the tank of a customer's car. In high bad humor, he returns to his own car and proceeds down the hill towards the filling station.In the garage, William and Danny have just finished repairing a car another customer left behind. Danny asks permission to drive it out of the garage, and William lets him do so. Hazell's car comes barreling down the hill at the same time as Danny is backing the car out of the garage, and both he and Hazell are forced to slam brakes to avoid a collision. William praises Danny for his quick thinking and Hazell, putting on a friendly tone, does the same. He then asks William if he'd be willing to sell his land - the Smiths own six acres of field and the garage, filling station, and an old caravan which serves as their home - but William tells him he already explained to the solicitor from Hazell's estate he was not interested.Hazell explains to William that his land is smack in the middle of the rest of his estate, and is preventing him from achieving his goal of having one of the biggest and best pheasant shoots in that part of England.

Hurricane Michael formed off the coast of Cuba carrying major Category 4 landfall in the Florida Panhandle. Surge in the Big Bend area, along... (Associated Press)      PANAMA CITY, Fla. (AP) — Hurricane Michael's battering waves swamped streets and docks and shrieking winds splintered trees and rooftops. The most powerful hurricane on record to hit Florida's Panhandle left wide destruction and at least one person dead and wasn't nearly finished Thursday as it crossed Georgia toward the Carolinas, still reeling from epic flooding in Hurricane Florence.      Authorities said at least one person has died, a man killed by a tree falling on a Panhandle home. Search and rescue crews were expected to escalate efforts to reach hardest-hit areas and check for anyone trapped or injured in the storm debris.      A day after the supercharged storm crashed ashore amid white sand beaches, fishing towns and military bases, Michael was no longer a Category 4 monster packing 155 mph (250 kph) winds. Downgraded to a tropical storm early Thursday over south-central Georgia, it continued to weaken but was still menacing the Southeast with heavy rains, blustery winds and possible spinoff tornadoes.      The National Hurricane Center in Miami said the eye of Michael was about 30 miles (48 kilometers) south-southwest of Macon in central Georgia at 12:00 a.m. Thursday. The storm had top sustained winds of 70 mph (112 kph) and was moving to the northeast at 17 mph (27 kph).      After daylight Thursday residents of north Florida would just be beginning to take stock of the enormity of the disaster.      Damage in Panama City near where Michael came ashore Wednesday afternoon was so extensive that broken and uprooted trees and downed power lines lay nearly everywhere. Roofs were peeled away, sent airborne, and homes were split open by fallen trees. Twisted street signs lay on the ground. Palm trees whipped wildly in the winds. More than 380,000 homes and businesses were without power at the height of the storm.      Vance Beu, 29, was staying with his mother at her home, Spring Gate Apartments, a complex of single-story wood frame buildings where they piled up mattresses around themselves for protection. A pine tree punched a hole in their roof and his ears even popped when the barometric pressure went lower. The roar of the winds, he said, sounded like a jet engine.      \\"It was terrifying, honestly. There was a lot of noise. We thought the windows were going to break at any time,\\" Beu said.      Sally Crown rode out Michael on the Florida Panhandle thinking at first that the worst damage was the many trees downed in her yard. But after the storm passed, she emerged to check on the cafe she manages and discovered a scene of breathtaking destruction.      \\"It's absolutely horrendous. Catastrophic,\\" Crown said. \\"There's flooding. Boats on the highway. A house on the highway. Houses that have been there forever are just shattered.\\"      A Panhandle man was killed by a tree that toppled on a home, Gadsden County Sheriff's Office spokeswoman Anglie Hightower said. But she added emergency crews trying to reach the home were hampered by downed trees and debris blocking roadways. The debris was a problem in many coastal communities and still hundreds of thousands of people were also left without power.      Gov. Rick Scott announced afterward that thousands of law enforcement officers, utility crews and search and rescue teams would now go into recovery mode. He said \\"aggressive\\" search and rescue efforts would get underway.      \\"Hurricane Michael cannot break Florida,\\" Scott vowed.      Michael sprang quickly from a weekend tropical depression, going from a Category 2 on Tuesday to a Category 4 by the time it came ashore. It forced more than 375,000 people up and down the Gulf Coast to evacuate as it gained strength quickly while crossing the eastern Gulf of Mexico toward north Florida. It moved so fast that people didn't' have much time to prepare, and emergency authorities lamented that many ignored the warnings and seemed to think they could ride it out.      In Panama City, plywood and metal flew off the front of a Holiday Inn Express. Part of the awning fell and shattered the glass front door of the hotel, and the rest of the awning wound up on vehicles parked below it.      \\"Oh my God, what are we seeing?\\" said evacuee Rachel Franklin, her mouth hanging open.      Based on its internal barometric pressure, Michael was the third most powerful hurricane to hit the U.S. mainland, behind the unnamed Labor Day storm of 1935 and Camille in 1969. Based on wind speed, it was the fourth-strongest, behind the Labor Day storm (184 mph, or 296 kph), Camille and Andrew in 1992.      It also brought the dangers of a life-threatening storm surge.      In Mexico Beach, population 1,000, the storm shattered homes, leaving floating piles of lumber. The lead-gray water was so high that roofs were about all that could be seen of many homes.      Hours earlier, meteorologists watched satellite imagery in complete awe as the storm intensified.      \\"We are in new territory,\\" National Hurricane Center Meteorologist Dennis Feltgen wrote on Facebook. \\"The historical record, going back to 1851, finds no Category 4 hurricane ever hitting the Florida panhandle.\\"      The storm is likely to fire up the debate over global warming. Scientists say global warming is responsible for more intense and more frequent extreme weather, such as storms, droughts, floods and fires. But without extensive study, they cannot directly link a single weather event to the changing climate.      After Michael left the Panhandle late Wednesday, Kaylee O'Brien was crying as she sorted through the remains of the apartment she shared with three roommates at Whispering Pines apartments, where the smell of broken pine trees was thick in the air. Four pine trees had crashed through the roof of her apartment, nearly hitting two people.      Her biggest worry: finding her missing 1-year-old Siamese cat, Molly.      \\"We haven't seen her since the tree hit the den. She's my baby,\\" a distraught O'Brien said, her face wet with tears.      ___      Associated Press writers Tamara Lush in St. Petersburg, Florida; Terry Spencer in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; Freida Frisaro in Miami; Brendan Farrington in St. Marks, Florida; Russ Bynum in Keaton Beach, Florida; Jonathan Drew in Raleigh, North Carolina; and Seth Borenstein in Kensington, Maryland, contributed to this story.      ___      For the latest on Hurricane Michael, visit https://www.apnews.com/tag/Hurricanes ||||| Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Aerial footage shows the destruction in Mexico Beach, Florida      One of the strongest storms in recorded history to hit the US has battered north-west Florida, flooding homes, washing out beaches and snapping trees.

Hurricanes develop from thunderstorms, fuelled by warm, moist air as they cross sub-tropical waters.      Warm air rises into the storm. Air swirls in to fill the low pressure in the storm, sucking air in and upwards, reinforcing the low pressure. The storm rotates due to the spin of the earth and energy from the warm ocean increases wind speeds as it builds. When winds reach 119km/h (74mph), it is known as a hurricane - in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific - or a typhoon in the Western Pacific. \\"Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Read the article and select the best answer. Article: In northern China during spring, big sandstorms often make trouble for people. Sandstorms usually happen in spring. They have happened in more than 10 provinces in northern China this year. People in southern China don't have to worry about this kind of bad weather. Most of the sand comes from the north of China. In northern China, lots of places have few trees and don't get much rain. When there aren't many trees, the ground can't keep enough water. Over the years, the ground dries up and turns into sand. When spring comes and the ice melts, the ground becomes loose. Strong winds take the loose sand into the sky. Besides, in northeast China, there is some vast desert. Sandstorms are bad for people's health. If people breathe in too much sand, they will cough or have serious illnesses. Sandstorms also give farmers lots of problems. Sometimes their sheep get lost in the storms and never come back home. The winds also tear the farmers'  houses down. What can you do to stop sandstorms? Here's a piece of advice. Ask your parents to help you plant some trees in spring. If you see people cutting down too many trees, tell them about the dangers of sandstorms, and ask your government to stop them. Question: Which of the following is NOT a way to stop sandstorms?

The national office directed field offices to gather information on mobsters in their territories and to report it regularly to Washington for a centralized collection of intelligence on racketeers. After the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO Act, took effect, the FBI began investigating the former Prohibition-organized groups, which had become fronts for crime in major cities and small towns. All of the FBI work was done undercover and from within these organizations, using the provisions provided in the RICO Act. Gradually the agency dismantled many of the groups. Although Hoover initially denied the existence of a National Crime Syndicate in the United States, the Bureau later conducted operations against known organized crime syndicates and families, including those headed by Sam Giancana and John Gotti.

Generate a detailed description of this data","output":"The data provided contains information about the Philippines, its language, its connection with Arabic, a Filipino dish called Batchoy, the presence of an ethnic group known as Chinese Filipino in the country, and the country itself. First, let's explore the Philippines. The Philippines is a Southeast Asian country located in the Western Pacific Ocean, comprised of more than 7,000 islands. The country has a diverse culture, with influences from Chinese, Spanish, American, and indigenous groups. This unique blend of cultures can be observed in various aspects of the Philippines, such as cuisine, clothing, religion, and language. The official languages spoken in the country are Filipino, which is based on Tagalog, and English. Arabic, another language mentioned in the provided data, is primarily spoken in the Middle East and North Africa. Although it is not an official language in the Philippines, it is used to a certain extent within the Filipino Muslim communities, specifically in the southern parts of the nation. Arabic plays a crucial role among the Muslim majority in the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (BARMM), as religious texts and communication within the community frequently use this language. Next, we have Batchoy, a well-known Filipino dish that originated from the Visayas region in the central part of the country. It is a flavorful soup that typically consists of pork, beef, or chicken, miki or egg noodles, crushed pork cracklings, vegetables, and garlic. Often served in a steaming hot bowl, Batchoy is famous for its rich, savory broth that blends various ingredients and flavors, making it a popular comfort food among Filipinos. Regarding the Chinese Filipino ethnic group, it is a significant part of the diverse population in the Philippines. As descendants of Chinese immigrants, these individuals have integrated themselves into the larger Filipino society for centuries. Many of them initially arrived as traders, and their influence can still be seen today in numerous aspects of local life. For instance, Filipino cuisine has adopted several Chinese dishes, such as lumpia (spring rolls) and pancit (noodles). In addition, Chinese Filipino families have played essential roles in the growth of the Philippine economy, establishing business empires that span various industries. In summary, the data provided offers a glimpse into the diverse and multifaceted aspects of the Philippines as a nation. It highlights the linguistic connection with Arabic, particularly among the Muslim Filipino communities, the popular Filipino dish Batchoy, the Chinese Filipino ethnic group, and the country itself with its rich, vibrant culture. These different components intertwine seamlessly and contribute to the Philippines' unique character that distinguishes it from other nations in the region and around the world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It also helps to make notes in pencil in the margin in your own words to summarize or comment on important points.","output":"b). It also helps to make notes in pencil in the margin in your own words to summarize or comment on important points. Effective study techniques are essential for academic success and personal growth. These techniques not only help to improve understanding and retention of knowledge, but also foster critical thinking skills and the ability to consistently produce high-quality work. One such technique is making notes in pencil in the margins of textbooks and other study materials. This method allows for flexibility and organization, while also being gentle on the material being used. Here is a detailed explanation of how to effectively use this technique: 1. Choose the right pencil: Select a pencil that is comfortable to hold and provides a clear and legible line. Ideally, use a pencil with a good eraser, so you can easily modify your notes later if necessary. 2. Read and understand: Before you begin writing notes, it's crucial to read and comprehend the material thoroughly. As you read, identify the key points and arguments presented in the text. 3. Marginal notes: When you come across an important point, argument, or piece of evidence in the text, write a concise summary or comment in your own words in the margin. By putting the information in your own words, you are actively engaging with the material, which can lead to better understanding and retention. 4. Highlight key terms and concepts: If you encounter new terms or crucial concepts, underline or circle them in the text and, if necessary, write a brief definition or explanation in the margin. This will help you quickly locate important information while reviewing your notes later. 5. Use abbreviations and symbols: To save time and space when writing your marginal notes, develop a system of abbreviations and symbols that you can consistently and clearly use. For example, use \\"+\\" for \\"and,\\" \\"=>\\" for \\"implies,\\" and \\"E.g.\\" for \\"for example.\\" 6. Connect ideas: If you notice connections between ideas or concepts within the text, draw lines or arrows linking the related marginal notes. This visual representation can help you see the bigger picture and understand how various points relate to one another. 7. Review and revise: Periodically revisit your marginal notes to reinforce your understanding and retention of the material. Use this opportunity to refine your notes and fill in any gaps in your understanding. 8. Use your marginal notes for further study: When studying for exams or working on assignments, refer to your marginal notes to quickly and easily recall important information and arguments from the text. This will save you time and effort, allowing you to focus on the critical aspects of your work. By implementing this technique, you can significantly enhance your study process. Making notes in pencil in the margin in your own words will help you actively engage with the material, resulting in a deeper understanding and improved retention of knowledge. Moreover, marginal notes serve as a convenient and organized reference tool that can boost your efficiency and success in your academic endeavors."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Bluemont Junction Trail in Arlington County replaced the line between Washington Boulevard and Bluemont Junction .","output":"Yes, these sentences can be considered paraphrases of each other, as they express the same meaning using different wordings and structures. Paraphrasing is the act of rephrasing or rewording a statement while still retaining its original meaning. When comparing these two sentences, we can observe several elements that have been altered, while the core message remains the same. Let's break down the components of both sentences to better illustrate this: 1. Sentence 1:    - Subject - Arlington County Washington Boulevard    - Action - replaced    - Object - the line between Bluemont Junction Trail and Bluemont Junction 2. Sentence 2:    - Subject - The Bluemont Junction Trail in Arlington County    - Action - replaced    - Object - the line between Washington Boulevard and Bluemont Junction Both sentences discuss that a replacement has occurred, and they both mention Arlington County, Washington Boulevard, Bluemont Junction Trail, and Bluemont Junction. The primary differences lie in the sentence structure, word order, and the specific focus of each sentence.  In Sentence 1, the focus is on the \\"Arlington County Washington Boulevard.\\" This is the primary subject performing the action of \\"replacing.\\" The object being replaced is the line between Bluemont Junction Trail and Bluemont Junction. In contrast, the focus of Sentence 2 is the \\"Bluemont Junction Trail in Arlington County,\\" which is the subject performing the same action of \\"replacing.\\" The object undergoing replacement is now the line between Washington Boulevard and Bluemont Junction. To summarize, both sentences convey the same information, about a replacement involving the Arlington County Washington Boulevard, Bluemont Junction Trail, and Bluemont Junction. The change in focus and rephrasing of the sentence components are what make these sentences paraphrases of each other."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Afraid for his life, he frequently tries to enlist in martial arts classes at a local dojo, only to have his applications mysteriously (read: deliberately) vanish. To further matters, the local minister turns the sermon at an Easter mass from the passion and resurrection of Christ to matters of Sodom and Gomorrah at the very sight of McClain and his mother entering the church to join in the ceremony. In the dojo's defense, they turn young McClain away not directly because of his sexual orientation, but because they fear losing their students over the matter. In fact, the family that runs the dojo has had some acceptance issues of their own to deal with, not just because of being Asian, but actually because of being multi-ethnic, with Irish, Asian, and even Filipino members and relatives. They're also of mixed faiths, with the grandparents devout Buddhists and one of their sons a Christian actively involved with the local church. The family has a very proud tradition of teaching the martial arts throughout the generations, a tradition that sadly is not open to the women of the family, as we learn when we are introduced to Karen O'Neil (played by the film's director D. Lee Inosanto), a black sheep of the family who returns to town to settle a small matter which is revealed later on in the film. McClain is cornered in the locker room after gym class and savagely beaten by the school bully, recently suspended from the football team (a move that lost him his scholarship, and the respect of his ex-convict brother).

Peter Hall directed the Bayreuth Ring after Chéreau. His version, staged 1983–86, portrayed the natural innocence of the Rhinemaidens in the simplest of ways; they were naked. Keith Warner adapted this feature in his Ring production for the Royal Opera House Covent Garden, first staged 2004–06. A Covent Garden spokesman explained \\"The maidens are children of innocence, a vision of nature – and as soon as someone appears they hastily throw on some clothes to protect their modesty.\\" While Warner relies on lighting to achieve an underwater effect, Hall used a Pepper's ghost illusion: mirrors at a 45° angle made the Rhinemaidens appear to swim vertically when the performers were in fact swimming horizontally in a shallow basin.Although the roles of the Rhinemaidens are relatively small, they have been sung by notable singers better known for performing major roles in Wagnerian and other repertoire. The first person to sing the part of Woglinde in full was Lilli Lehmann at Bayreuth in 1876. In 1951, when the Bayreuth Festival re-opened after the Second World War, the same part was taken by Elisabeth Schwarzkopf. Other Bayreuth Rhinemaidens include  Helga Dernesch who sang Wellgunde there between 1965 and 1967.

What is the answer to this question? the classic greek model of the agora was?","output":"The classic Greek model of the Agora was a central public space that served as the heart of social, political, and economic life in ancient Greek city-states. It played a crucial role in the development of democracy and the Greek way of life during the Classical period (5th-4th centuries BCE). This open square or marketplace was typically located near the center of a town and was surrounded by numerous important civic buildings, temples, and monuments, reflecting the multi-functional nature of ancient Greek society. In the classic Greek model of the Agora, several essential elements and characteristics contributed to its importance: 1. Administrative and public buildings: The Athenian Agora, one of the most well-known examples, was bordered by government buildings such as the Bouleuterion (council house) and the Prytaneion (town hall). These were the sites where the city's council and assembly met to make decisions that affected the entire population. 2. Judicial function: The Agora often housed law courts where citizens could seek justice and trials were conducted. In ancient Athens, the Heliaia was the largest law court, where jurors were chosen to deliberate on cases. 3. Commercial activities: The Agora was a center for buying and selling goods and services. Merchants, artisans, and farmers would gather to offer their products in small shops or stalls. Some Agoras featured porticoes, like the Stoa of Attalos in Athens, where people could browse through enclosed rows of shops. 4. Social interactions and cultural events: It was a prominent gathering place for citizens to discuss and debate social and political issues or to exchange information and news. Public speeches, dramatic performances, and musical events were often held in the Agora, contributing to the vibrant cultural life of ancient Greek cities. 5. Religious sites: Temples and sanctuaries dotted the landscape of the Agora. One famous example is the Temple of Hephaestus in Athens, which overlooked the square. These sacred spaces were important for religious activities and celebrations. 6. Monuments and statues: The Agora also served as a place to honor notable citizens, famous events, or the city's patron deities with various statues, dedications, and monuments. These artistic displays and memorials helped reinforce collective memory and shared values among the population. 7. Education and philosophy: Figures like Socrates and Plato frequented the Agora in Athens, engaging citizens in philosophical dialogues and teaching students. Public spaces like these were crucial in fostering the intellectual growth and exchange of ideas that characterized ancient Greek society. In summary, the classic Greek model of the Agora was a multi-purpose public space that facilitated a wide range of activities. It was the hub of political, social, economic, religious, and cultural life in ancient Greek cities and significantly influenced the development of democratic institutions and practices. The Agora's many functions and elements have left a lasting legacy not only in the field of archaeology but also in modern urban planning and design."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","output":"Based on the background information provided, freezing slows food decay and the growth of micro-organisms, making it an effective method for food preservation. Lower temperatures contribute to slower reaction rates and limit bacterial growth due to reduced water availability. In the situation presented, Robert the baker has two temperature options for freezing his cupcakes: 0° F and 10° F. Since lower temperatures slow reaction rates and bacterial growth more effectively, storing the cupcakes at 0° F will result in slower decay compared to storing them at 10° F.  Therefore, the temperature that will result in faster decay of the cupcakes is 10° F. To better preserve the cupcakes, Robert should store them at 0° F in the freezer."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

By Sarah Griffiths The Earth’s magnetic field, which protects the planet from cosmic radiation, has grown weaker over the past six months. Data collected by the European Space Agency’s Swarm satellites has indicated weak spots in the magnetic field. The first set of high-resolution images generated from the constellation reveals dramatic declines over the Western Hemisphere. The Earth's magnetic field, which protects the planet from solar radiation, has grown weaker over the past six months, according to satellite data. This map shows the filed from January to June. Shades of red represent areas of strengthening, while blues show areas of weakening over the 6-month period","output":". Scientists are currently investigating the potential causes and long-term implications of this weakening magnetic field. Despite the concerning data, experts reassure that this decline is not a definitive sign of an impending catastrophic event, such as a geomagnetic reversal. The Earth's magnetic field has displayed fluctuations throughout its history, and periods of weakening have occurred even in the absence of any known reversals.  Researchers are now focused on studying the behavior of the magnetic field in order to better understand the processes occurring within the Earth's core, which generate the magnetic field. Developing a comprehensive understanding of these processes will enable scientists to make more accurate predictions about the future evolution of the magnetic field, and to potentially mitigate any potential risks associated with its fluctuations. In the meantime, governments and organizations around the world are encouraged to monitor and prepare for any potential consequences of a weaker magnetic field. As our reliance on technology and infrastructure susceptible to space weather events continues to grow, better understanding and predicting the Earth's magnetic field will help ensure the resilience and safety of our society in the face of this natural phenomenon."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

REUTERS/Rafael Marchante/File Photo Reuters      VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - Pope Francis will makes saints of two of the three Portuguese shepherd children believed to have seen a vision of the Madonna 100 years ago at Fatima, the Vatican said on Thursday.      The pope, who is due to visit Fatima in May for the 100th anniversary of the reported apparitions, approved decrees recognizing miracles attributed to the intercession of Francisco Marto and his sister Jacinta Marto.      They died while they were still children several years after the visions. The third visionary, Lucia Dos Santos, became a nun and died in 2005 at the age of 97.      Francisco and Jacinta Marto were beatified - the last step before sainthood - by Pope John Paul in 2000.      The Catholic Church posthumously confers sainthood on people considered so holy during their lives that they are now believed to be with God and can intercede with him to perform miracles.      Miracles are usually the medically inexplicable healing of someone.      The Church believes that the Madonna gave the children three messages, the so-called three secrets of Fatima.      The first two were revealed soon and concerned a vision of hell, the prediction of the outbreak of World War Two, a warning that Russia would \\"spread her errors\\" in the world, and the need for general conversion to God and the need for prayer.      The \\"third secret\\" intrigued the world for more than three-quarters of a century, inspiring books and cults convinced that it predicted the end of the world.      In 2000, the Vatican said the third secret was a prediction of the 1981 assassination attempt on Pope John Paul on May 13, the same day of the first reported apparition in 1917.      The Vatican did not say when the sainthood ceremony of Jacinta and Francisco Marto would take place but Church sources said it was likely to be held during the pope's visit in May.      (Reporting by Philip Pullella; Editing by Alison Williams) ||||| ROME — Pope Francis on Thursday officially recognized a miracle attributed to the intercession of a young brother and sister who said, 100 years ago, that the Virgin Mary had appeared to them in the Portuguese village of Fátima.      The approval of the miracle was the final step needed before the siblings, Jacinta and Francisco Marto, could be made saints. By signing the decree, the pope increased the likelihood that he could canonize the two when he visits the Fátima shrine in May, 100 years to the day that the children said that a vision of Mary had appeared to them for the first time. Officially, no date has been set for the canonization ceremony.      The Marto children and their cousin Lucia de Jesus dos Santos said they had seen the apparitions six times between May 13, 1917, and Oct. 13, 1917, when Jacinta was 7, Francisco was 9 and Lucia was 10.      By the time of the last apparition — in 1917 — 50,000 to 70,000 people had gathered to pray with the children, according to the website of the Shrine of Fátima. ||||| Write a summary.","output":"Pope Francis is set to make saints of two of the three Portuguese shepherd children who claimed to have seen a vision of the Madonna 100 years ago in Fatima.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"If more phase changes were to occur in the process of cell division, it could potentially affect the process of replication. The perturbation could lead to disruptions or alterations in the proper progression of the cell cycle phases, which might result in errors in DNA replication, chromosome segregation, or cytokinesis. The supposed perturbation could have both direct and indirect effects on the process. Direct effects might include changes in the behavior of specific proteins or enzymatic activities involved in DNA replication or chromosome segregation. These changes, in turn, could lead to misaligned or improperly separated chromosomes, which might eventually result in cell death or the development of abnormal cells. Indirect effects could arise from changes in the regulatory mechanisms that control the progression of the cell cycle. Perturbations in the fine balance of activators and inhibitors that control the cell cycle could result in uncontrolled cell division, leading to the formation of cancerous or abnormally functioning cells. Alternatively, disruptions in the proper timing of cell cycle events might result in delays or premature completion of specific phases, which could negatively impact the cell's ability to replicate its DNA accurately. In any case, a perturbation affecting the multiple phases of the cell cycle would likely have consequences for the process of replication, potentially leading to errors in DNA replication, complications in chromosome segregation, or other disruptions in the proper functioning of the cell."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Despite these improvements, during the 1910s discs decisively won this early format war, although Edison continued to produce new Blue Amberol cylinders for an ever-dwindling customer base until late in 1929. By 1919 the basic patents for the manufacture of lateral-cut disc records had expired, opening the field for countless companies to produce them.

Previously, a judge had ruled that a claim made in the biography of Polish-Jewish singer Wiera Gran that Szpilman had been a member of the Jewish police in the Warsaw ghetto during WWII was protected by freedom of speech—despite testimony to the contrary by survivors, as well as biographer Agata Tuszynska being dubious about Gran's claim, the AFP reports. With this new decision, Tuszynska and her publisher have 15 days to make a public apology to Szpilman's son and widow and cut the offending material from future editions of Vera Gran: The Accused. Of the decision, per the Guardian, Szpilman's son says it will \\"allow ethical standards in Poland to Improve.\\" But Tuszynska tells a local newspaper that she is \\"really sorry\\" about the ruling, adding, \\"Once again, they have closed Wiera Gran's mouth.\\" Gran herself was accused of being a Nazi collaborator, according to reports. Although she was eventually cleared, continuing criticism prompted her to leave Poland in 1950. Szpilman, who died in 2000, was portrayed by Adrien Brody in The Pianist, notes Time. The film, directed by Roman Polanski, won three Academy Awards, including an Oscar for best actor for Brody, who remains the youngest person ever to achieve that honor.

The claim was initially made in the biography of Polish-Jewish singer Wiera Gran that Szpilman was a member of the Jewish police in the Warsaw ghetto during WWII. A judge had previously ruled that this claim was protected under freedom of speech but the testimonies of survivors and the biographer's doubts about Gran's claim were not taken into account. Now, the court has decided that the claim was indeed defamatory, and the biographer Agata Tuszynska and her publisher are required to make a public apology to Szpilman's son and widow, as well as remove the offending material from future editions of Vera Gran: The Accused.  This ruling is seen as a victory for truth and ethical standards in Poland, according to Szpilman's son. However, Tuszynska expressed disappointment about the ruling, claiming that it silenced Wiera Gran, who herself was accused of being a Nazi collaborator. Despite being cleared of the charges, she faced constant criticism and left Poland in 1950. Wladyslaw Szpilman, portrayed by Adrien Brody in the critically acclaimed film The Pianist, directed by Roman Polanski, passed away in 2000.

The band was conceived by would-be Glasgow scene-maker Alan Cairnduff, although he left the job of organising the band to his friend John Milarky. At Cairnduff's suggestion, Milarky teamed up with two musicians he had never worked with before - budding singer and lyricist Jim Kerr and guitarist Charlie Burchill. Kerr and Burchill had known each other since the age of eight. After joining Johnny & The Self-Abusers, they brought in two of their school friends, Brian McGee on drums and Tony Donald on bass (all four had previously played together in the schoolboy band Biba-Rom!).  With Milarky established as singer, guitarist and saxophonist, the line-up was completed by his friend Allan McNeill as third guitarist. Kerr and Burchill also doubled on keyboards and violin respectively. In common with the early punk bands, various members took on stage names--Milarky became \\"Johnnie Plague\\", Kerr became \\"Pripton Weird\\", MacNeil chose \\"Sid Syphilis\\" and Burchill chose \\"Charlie Argue\\".  Johnny & The Self-Abusers played their first gig on Easter Monday, 11 April 1977, at the Doune Castle pub in Glasgow. The band played support to rising punk stars Generation X in Edinburgh two weeks later. The band went on to play a summer of concerts in Glasgow. The band soon split into two factions, with Milarky and McNeil on one side and Kerr, Donald, Burchill and McGee on the other: at the same time, Milarky's compositions were being edged out in favour of those of Kerr and Burchill.  In November 1977, Johnny & The Self-Abusers released its only single, \\"Saints and Sinners\\", on Chiswick Records (which was dismissed as being \\"rank and file\\" in a Melody Maker review). The band split on the same day that the single was released, with Milarky and McNeil going on to form The Cuban Heels. Ditching the stage names and the overt punkiness, the remaining members continued together as Simple Minds (naming themselves after a David Bowie lyric from his song \\"Jean Genie\\").  The next record, Sparkle in the Rain, was produced by Steve Lillywhite and released in February 1984. It gave rise to successful singles like \\"Waterfront\\" (which hit No. 1 in a few European countries) and \\"Speed Your Love to Me\\" and \\"Up on the Catwalk\\". Sparkle in the Rain topped the charts in the UK and hit the Top 20 in several other countries (including Canada, where it reached No. 13).  In 1984, Jim Kerr married Chrissie Hynde from the Pretenders (who renamed herself Christine Kerr). Simple Minds did a North American tour where they played as headliners supported by China Crisis during the Canadian leg and in support of the Pretenders in the US while Hynde was pregnant with Kerr's daughter. The marriage lasted until 1990.  Despite the band's new-found popularity in the UK, Europe, Canada and Australia, Simple Minds remained essentially unknown in the US. The band's UK releases on Arista were not picked up by Arista USA who had 'right of first refusal' for their releases. The 1985 film The Breakfast Club broke Simple Minds into the US market, when the band achieved their only No. 1 U.S. pop hit in April 1985 with the film's closing track, \\"Don't You (Forget About Me)\\". The song was written by Keith Forsey and Steve Schiff; Forsey offered the song to Billy Idol and Bryan Ferry before Simple Minds agreed to record it. The song soon became a chart-topper in many other countries around the world.  At around this point, the camaraderie that had fuelled Simple Minds began to unravel, and over the next ten years the band's line-up underwent frequent changes. Jim Kerr subsequently recalled \\"We were knackered. We were desensitized. The band started to fracture. We were lads who had grown up together, we were meant to grow together, politically, spiritually and artistically. But we were getting tired with each other. There was an element of the chore creeping in. We were coasting and this whole other thing was a challenge.\\"  The first casualty was bassist Derek Forbes, who was beginning to squabble with Kerr. Forbes began failing to turn up for rehearsals, and was dismissed. Forbes remained in touch with the band (and soon reunited with another former Simple Minds bandmate, drummer Brian McGee, in Propaganda). Forbes was replaced by former Brand X bass player John Giblin (who owned the band's rehearsal space and was a session musician who had worked with Peter Gabriel and Kate Bush). Giblin made his debut with Simple Minds at Live Aid in Philadelphia, where the band performed \\"Don't You (Forget About Me)\\", a new track called \\"Ghost Dancing\\" and \\"Promised You a Miracle\\". Simple Minds were the first band to be approached to play the Philadelphia leg of Live Aid.  Simple Minds returned to activity later in 1994. By now the band was officially a duo of Kerr and Burchill (with the latter taking on keyboards in the studio, as well as guitar). Hiring Keith Forsey (the writer of \\"Don't You (Forget About Me)\\") as producer, they began to put together an album which returned to the uplifting arena rock feel of their Once Upon a Time days. With Gaynor now out of the picture, the remaining instrumentation was covered by session musicians (although Malcolm Foster was included among the bass players used for recording).  Good News from the Next World was released in 1995. The album reached No. 2 in the UK and produced the two Top 20 hits \\"She's a River\\" and \\"Hypnotised\\". The band toured to promote Good News from the Next World, with Malcolm Foster and Mark Taylor as touring bass and keyboard players and Mark Schulman (who had played on the album) on drums. This was Foster's last work with the band, and Schulman returned to session work at the end of the tour.  After being released from their contract with Virgin Records, Simple Minds made use of the skills of their original rhythm section, Derek Forbes and Brian McGee (returning after respective eleven- and fourteen-year absences). Although McGee was not involved beyond the rehearsal stage, Forbes formally rejoined Simple Minds in July 1996. The band then reunited with Mel Gaynor for a studio session in early 1997. Gaynor was reinstated as a full-time member for the European tour (which once again featured Mark Taylor on keyboards).  After the tour, album recording sessions were interrupted by Kerr and Burchill's decision to play live (without Forbes, Taylor or Gaynor) as part of the Proms tour (a series of orchestral concerts featuring a mixture of light classical and pop music). The duo played versions of \\"Alive And Kicking\\", \\"Belfast Child\\" and \\"Don't You (Forget About Me)\\" backed by a full orchestra and were billed as Simple Minds.

The necklaces were given to Samantha and not Rachel because","output":"they held magnificently and unusually large Amethysts with intricate designs etched into them. These were no ordinary pieces of jewelry, but magical amulets passed down through generations in Samantha's bloodline. The legacy was that they would only reflect their true power and splendor in the hands of the women born into the family.  Rachel, though close as a sister to Samantha, was not the rightful recipient of the necklaces. For Rachel was Samantha's best friend, close as kin, but not by blood. She was orphaned as a child and taken in by Samantha's family. Samantha's parents treated her and loved her as if she was their own. But despite the love they bore for both girls, the unwavering tradition dictated that the necklaces could only be given to the direct descendants in the family.  And now, on Samantha's 20th birthday, the day marked by tradition for the transfer of the amulets took place. Samantha's mother handed them over with a warming embrace, her eyes glossy with unshed tears. \\"These were your grandmother's, and her mother's before her, and now they are yours,\\" she said, a tremor in her voice. Through generations, the amulets had been symbols of womanhood and wisdom – an emblem of their family's legacy. However, the decision wasn't without its consequences. An air of melancholy surrounded Rachel; an emotion rising from being left out of a momentous family ritual, rather than materialistic envy. It wasn't the amulets' material value that stirred Rachel's sadness, but the symbolic bond it reinforced between Samantha and her bloodline, highlighting her own lack of connection to her unknown ancestry. To ease Rachel's discomfort, Samantha suggested that they share this tradition together, promising that although Rachel wouldn't be its actual bearer, they could discover its mysteries together. After all, they had tackled every other aspect of their lives together, why should this be different? Samantha's eyes danced to the rhythm of excitement. \\"I bet there is a lot we can explore, there are legends of these amulets containing secrets, powers, adventurous tales,\\" Samantha pondered, a dreamy look in her eyes. Rachel's perennial spirit sparked at the thought of an adventure. It was always her spirit that fought the restlessness of reality – the thirst of the unknown. The necklaces were perhaps given to Samantha to help her with her bloodline's tradition, but Samantha and Rachel would take this tradition further, making it their own. They would uncover the mysteries of the amulets together, and in doing so, they would continue to reinforce their bond – a bond that was stronger than any blood relationship could ever be. Time would show these necklaces were not meant to create a divide, but instead act as a force to bring the girls even closer, embarking on a journey steeped in history, magic, and shared sisterhood."},{"instruction":"Q: Read the following article and answer the question.

A: Subsequent Spanish or other European parties are believed to have released pigs there, which had become feral and abundant on the island by the time European settlement began.  Does the answer correctly answer the question Possible answers: (A). yes. (B). no.","output":"A: European parties, particularly Spanish explorers, are responsible for releasing pigs in Bermuda. These pigs eventually became feral and widespread on the island before the European settlement began. Spanish explorers, who first discovered Bermuda in the early 16th century, likely released pigs as a source of future food and sustenance for any travelers in the area, though the exact details of their introduction may be lost to history. Feral pigs, also known as wild boars or razorbacks, descend from domesticated pigs that were either intentionally or accidentally released into the wild. Over time, these pigs have adapted to their environment, becoming more resilient and resourceful. In the case of Bermuda, the feral pig population grew rapidly in the absence of natural predators and with ample food available from the island's natural resources. In addition to the Spanish, other European explorers and settlers also contributed to the introduction of pigs to various regions across the globe. For example, in the United States, Hernando de Soto is known to have brought pigs with him on his 16th-century explorations, which would eventually lead to the establishment of feral pig populations in parts of the U.S. Feral pigs have had a significant impact on the environments they inhabit. In Bermuda, their foraging activities altered the island's ecosystem, affecting the distribution and abundance of native plant species. With the European settlement in Bermuda and the introduction of other domestic animals, the population of feral pigs was eventually brought under control, although their descendants can still be found in certain areas. In conclusion, European parties, initially led by Spanish explorers, are responsible for releasing pigs in Bermuda. These animals, which have become feral and abundant, have had significant ecological impacts on the island and remain a part of its natural history."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The rest of the film then occurs in flashback. In 1941, LaMotta is in a major boxing match against Jimmy Reeves, where he received his first loss. Jake's brother Joey LaMotta (Joe Pesci) discusses a potential shot for the middleweight title with one of his Mafia connections, Salvy Batts (Frank Vincent). Some time thereafter, Jake spots a 15-year-old girl named Vikki (Cathy Moriarty) at an open-air swimming pool in his Bronx neighborhood. He eventually pursues a relationship with her, even though he is already married. In 1943, Jake defeats Sugar Ray Robinson, and has a rematch three weeks later. Despite the fact that Jake dominates Robinson during the bout, the judges surprisingly rule in favor of Robinson and Joey feels Robinson won only because he was enlisting into the US Army the following week. By 1947, Jake marries Vikki. Jake constantly worries about Vikki having feelings for other men, particularly when she makes an off-hand comment about Tony Janiro, Jake's opponent in his next fight. His jealousy is evident when he brutally defeats Janiro in front of the local Mob boss, Tommy Como (Nicholas Colasanto), and Vikki. As Joey discusses the victory with journalists at the Copacabana, he is distracted by seeing Vikki approach a table with Salvy and his crew.

Step 1: Start with the Movie Title and Overview Title: \\"Falling Echoes\\" \\"Falling Echoes\\" was anticipated to be a groundbreaking mystery thriller, but sadly, the film is a far cry from expectations.  Step 2: Comment on the Movie's Plot. The plot, rather than being the mind-bending experience we were promised, came off as a chaotic, and poorly strung along attempt at suspense. It was filled with illogical twists and turns that instead of enhancing the storytelling, did quite the opposite, creating a forest of confusion and unbelievable scenarios.  Step 3: Criticize Characters and Their Development The characters are as flat as they come, with no development or growth throughout the film. The protagonist is mysteriously unrelatable and distant, making it almost impossible for the audience to resonate or connect with him. Step 4: Discuss the Technical Aspects Despite having some visually appealing shots, the cinematography fails to compensate for the movie's narrative shortcomings. The editing was erratic, propelling the audience from one disjointed scene to another with no fluidity whatsoever. Step 5: Critique the Acting The acting, unfortunately, did nothing to salvage \\"Falling Echoes\\". The cast's performances felt forced and robotic, lacking in depth and emotive prowess, thereby further undermining the thin plot. Step 6: Provide an Overall Summary and Rating  As much as I wanted to find a silver lining, \\"Falling Echoes\\" proved to be a massive letdown. The film's pitiful attempt at a convoluted plot combined with lackluster performances and forgettable characters make for a regrettable viewing experience.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question: Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: What 1993 science fiction horror-themed first person shooter video game surpassed Corridor 7: Alien Invasion? Answer:","output":"The 1993 science fiction horror-themed first-person shooter video game that surpassed Corridor 7: Alien Invasion in terms of popularity, influence, and impact in the gaming industry is Doom, developed and published by id Software. Doom was released on December 10, 1993, for the MS-DOS platform, and it quickly transformed the gaming landscape with its groundbreaking and innovative features. Doom's success can be attributed to a variety of factors that set it apart from its competitors, including Corridor 7: Alien Invasion. Some of the most important aspects that contributed to Doom's supremacy are: 1. Graphics and Technologies: Doom introduced revolutionary graphics and a pseudo-3D game engine called the id Tech 1 engine, also known as the Doom engine. This was a massive leap forward in video game graphics technologies, allowing for complex levels with varying heights, dynamic lighting, and the ability to use textures on all surfaces, which contributed to a more immersive and visually-appealing experience than Corridor 7: Alien Invasion. 2. Gameplay and Level Design: The gameplay in Doom was fast-paced, intense, and action-packed, offering a more engaging experience for players. With diverse and non-linear level design, players were encouraged to explore and locate secret areas, items, and weapons, ushering in a new era of replayability and discovery. On the other hand, Corridor 7: Alien Invasion featured a slower-paced gameplay style and more linear level design, which did not resonate with players as much as Doom's dynamic approach. 3. Weapons and Enemies: Doom provided players with a plethora of iconic and powerful weapons, like the shotgun, chaingun, and BFG 9000. This arsenal allowed players to respond to various enemy types and situations effectively. The game was also famous for its diverse and menacing roster of enemies, featuring various demons and monsters, each with unique attacks and behaviors. In comparison, although Corridor 7: Alien Invasion had a decent selection of weapons and enemies, it failed to match Doom's depth and variety in this regard. 4. Atmosphere and Sound Design: Doom's dark and oppressive atmosphere was created through the combination of its visuals, level design, and intense music and sound effects. The game effectively used lighting and texture work to immerse players in an unsettling and atmospheric experience. The effective use of sound, including memorable music scores by composer Bobby Prince, contributed to the game's dark, adrenaline-pumping aura. Corridor 7: Alien Invasion, while similarly dark in theme, did not manage to create the same level of immersion and atmospheric impact as Doom. 5. Modding and Customization: Doom had a profound impact on the modding community, as id Software released the game's source code and encouraged players to create custom content. This led to the birth of the WAD file format, which allowed users to create new levels and modifications. The result was an endless stream of additional content and creative ideas that extended Doom's life beyond its initial release and cemented its status as an iconic title. Corridor 7: Alien Invasion lacked such an extensive modding community, which negatively impacted its longevity in comparison to Doom. In conclusion, Doom surpassed Corridor 7: Alien Invasion in 1993 due to its groundbreaking technology, engaging gameplay, diverse weapon and enemy selection, immersive atmosphere, and its impact on the modding community. It is considered one of the most influential and essential video games in history for these reasons, while Corridor 7: Alien Invasion, although ambitious, failed to achieve a similar level of significance in the gaming world."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: At what lake in the area that has been covered by sea water at least seven times do nutrients quickly deteriorate? from the following article ?  A vast marshland could only have been formed due to the underlying rock formations in southern Florida. The floor of the Everglades formed between 25 million and 2 million years ago when the Florida peninsula was a shallow sea floor. The peninsula has been covered by sea water at least seven times since the earliest bedrock formation. The rock that makes up the Everglades floor was created as layers of calcium carbonate were compressed by ocean water, making limestone. Fossilized bryozoans and tiny shells, or ooids, make the limestone porous. Water is stored in the rock, sometimes from one year to the next. The length of time that a region in the Everglades remains flooded, called a hydroperiod, determines what particular soils and vegetation are present. Shorter hydroperiods of three or four months promote the growth of periphyton: algae and other microscopic organisms covered with calcium carbonate crystals. Periphyton is the basic building block of marl, a calcitic mud. In areas with hydroperiods of longer than nine months, peat builds up over hundreds or thousands of years due to many generations of decaying plant matter. Peat and marl are considered nutrient-poor soils that foster the growth of specialized vegetation depending on the length of the regional hydroperiod. Five types of peat appear in the Everglades system; each type supports a specific type of vegetation, such as sawgrass, tree islands, or custard apple trees. Peat buildup is possible because water prevents oxygen from quickly decomposing plant matter. Once peat buildup reaches the surface, oxygen reacts with the microorganisms to decay the peat rapidly in a process called subsidence. Initial attempts at developing agriculture near Lake Okeechobee were successful, but the nutrients in the peat quickly deteriorated by drying, and were broken down by bacteria in the soil.

Answer the following question: Read the article and select the best answer. Article: When you consider what subject to study in college, chances are that you and your parents will think about what you can make out of _ after graduation. You will likely ask the question: \\"Can I find a well-paid job or simply a job with a degree in this in the future?\\" This consideration also influences students when they come to choose between studying science or humanities   at college. People generally believe that the humanities, which include literature ,  history, cultural studies and philosophy,  do not prepare students for a specific vocation  . Science subjects, however, are considered vocational courses that produce scientists, engineers and economists  . \\"I've decided to take finance as my college major. My parents and I think this subject will help me get a good job or start a business,\\" said Huachen Yueru, 17, a science student at Wuxi No. 1 High School. Even those who choose a liberal arts   education often pick the humanities subject which they think will best help them later find a job. \\"I'm going to study Spanish in college, which I believe will open doors to a high-paying job for me,\\" said Liu Chao, 18, a Senior 2 student at Dalian No 20 High School. He said few of his classmates show interest in subjects like philosophy and history, which are seen as \\"less promising\\" in job markets. The popularity of liberal arts subjects among college students has also been decreasing in the United States. American scholars   and universities are concerned that in the ongoing economic crisis   liberal arts subjects will be hit hardest. As money tightens  , they worry that the humanities may become \\"a great luxury   that many cannot afford\\", according to the New York Times. Question: What can we infer from the passage ? Options: A: Humanities are becoming less and less popular with the students. B: Studying science subjects is sure to find a well-paid job. C: The humanities in college should be cancelled. D: The writer thinks those who choose the liberal arts education will choose their favorite subjects.

Given the following context:  As Harvey's interests shifted to the Pyramid, Monte Ne's resort days effectively ended and the number of visitors slowly dwindled. Activities and events at Monte Ne continued, supported by locals who still visited in large numbers. Harvey sold the Hotel Monte Ne. The hotel went through several name changes and owners, becoming the White Hotel circa 1912, the Randola Inn in 1918, the Hotel Frances in 1925, and in 1930 the Sleepy Valley Hotel. Monte Ne's larger hotels continued to be active after they, along with the dance pavilion and Elixir Spring, were foreclosed and sold at public auction. From 1927 to 1932, Missouri Row and Oklahoma Row (often called the Club House Hotels at this point) were home to the Ozark Industrial College and School of Theology, a nonsectarian school run by Dan W. Evans. The hotels housed pupils—Missouri Row for boys, Oklahoma Row for girls—and Oklahoma Row also provided classroom and dining spaces. Evans and his family lived in the tower. The dance pavilion was enclosed and served as the school chapel. In May 1932, following a mortgage foreclosure against the school, school officials were evicted and the property was sold.After he announced the building of the Pyramid, at age 69, Harvey began suffering a series of serious health problems, but continued to work tirelessly. In 1926, blood poisoning in his foot put him in a coma that lasted several days resulting in surgery, and three months of recuperation. In 1929 he and Anna were finally divorced. Three days later Harvey married his long-time personal secretary May Leake. In 1930, he came down with double pneumonia. He was also going blind and needed younger people to read his letters and the newspaper to him.  answer the following question:  What is the name of the person in whose foot was blood poisoning?","output":"The name of the person in whose foot was blood poisoning is Harvey."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

He'd take the liberty to hide my backpack, borrow my books without consent, doodle scandalous stuff on my notebooks with a pen and yada yada. So one day, I was showing this cool trick I learned on an anatomy program on the TV to a couple of classmates who used to sit around me. The thing was that you can't flex your ring finger upwards if you put your middle finger under the palm (try that) We were all kids, and soon everyone in the class started staring at us weirdos looking laughing at out hands. The bully noticed it too, and came near to inquire about this hand stuff. I described the trick and he was impressed. And then, I saw our teacher walking up the corridor, just a couple paces behind the class door. So, I asked him (the bully) if he wanted to see another trick and to that he nodded a big yes. Cool, What I did was, that I grabbed his right arm by the thumb and put it on my throat right above the larynx. Then I quickly shifted my grip to his wrist. He without batting an eye, asked what I was doing, but then I started beating the desk with my other hand and made squeaking noises while pushing his hand against my throat harder with every turning head. And voilà! Every one in the class (including the teacher) thought he was smothering me. After a few ifs and buts between him and the teacher, he was summoned at the principal’s chambers, from where, later he was sent home, where presumably judging from the look on his face for the next few days, he was beat to crap by his folks. And after that, never was I ever bothered by anyone in the school.(^^) How did the bully behave after learning the cool trick?  A. Upset  B. Impressed  C.

Scotland's Finance Minister John Swinney is meeting his Treasury counterpart Greg Hands in the hope of meeting the 23 February deadline. Both sides will be called to give evidence to Holyrood's devolution committee on that date. Mr Swinney and Mr Hands hope a deal can be struck this week. However, both men have said the onus is on the other to give some ground. Ahead of the meeting, Mr Swinney said he remained \\"committed to reaching an agreement that is in line with the principles of the Smith Commission\\". He said: \\"For both parliaments to have adequate time to scrutinise an agreement, it is important that we make progress.\\" No deal. No further devolution. Holyrood can't take on extra tax and welfare powers unless there's a fiscal framework to underpin them. Any framework will include a system to reduce the grant Holyrood gets from the Treasury, to reflect its growing ability to raise its own revenue. The two sides are struggling to agree the fairest way to achieve that. The Scottish government says the Treasury's current offer would leave it out of pocket. The Treasury disputes that and says SNP ministers can't expect taxpayers in the rest of the UK to underwrite all the risks that come with extra responsibilities. The Scotland Office minister, Lord Dunlop, says the UK government is \\"committed to go the extra mile to get a deal\\". But First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says she \\"will not sign up to a deal that's unfair to Scotland\\". First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has written to Prime Minister David Cameron calling for him to step in over the matter. He has said that \\"no one is keener\\" than he is to reach an agreement, but also warned the Scottish government would have to be ready to \\"move towards\\" his position. Despite months of talks, the deadline for agreement was pushed back earlier this month. On Wednesday, Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson proposed a compromise that would see both sides give some ground to agree a shorter-term deal that would be reviewed in five years. Earlier this week, Mr Hands was criticised for being on holiday with his family while negotiations were taking place. A Treasury spokeswoman has said the UK government had shown it was willing to compromise and \\"go the extra mile\\" to secure an agreement. The two sides differ on key parts of the deal, in particular their interpretation of the \\"no detriment\\" principle called for by the Smith Commission on further powers for Scotland. This means neither the Scottish or UK budgets should be left worse off in future by the finalised agreement. The Scottish government claims the Treasury's latest offer would amount to an \\"almost Â£3bn cut\\", while Mr Hands insists an offer tabled by Mr Swinney is \\"not logical\\" and \\"not fair\\" to taxpayers across the rest of the UK. The deal proposed by Ms Davidson would see both parties give some ground. She wants the Scottish government to agree to the UK government's new method of calculating the amount of money it receives each year from the Treasury. In return, she wants the UK government to guarantee the devolved administration would not receive \\"a penny less\\" than it would under its preferred mechanism, effectively insuring Holyrood against any budget shortfall. This deal would then be reviewed in full after a five-year trial period. What is a summary of this text?","output":"Scotland's Finance Minister, John Swinney, is meeting with his counterpart Greg Hands in hopes of meeting a deadline regarding Holyrood's devolution committee.

That's right, it's time for those of us who live in open primary and caucus states—andin the next three weeks—to head out and cast a vote for Rick Santorum.      Why would we do such a crazy thing? Lots of great reasons!      Republican turnout has sucked, and appears to be getting worse by the contest. Unlike the 2008 Democratic primaries, which helped President Barack Obama and the Democrats to build a national organization, the GOP is an organizational disaster, with waning voter interest. That means that it takes fewer votes to have an impact than if Republican turnout was maxed out.      Several of the contests have produced razor-thin margins of victory. Rick Santorum won Iowa by 34 votes, Mitt Romney \\"won\\" Maine by 194 votes. It won't take many of us to swing contests the way we want them to swing.      The longer this GOP primary drags on, the better the numbers for Team Blue. Not only is President Barack Obama rising in comparison to the clowns in the GOP field, but GOP intensity is down—which would have repercussions all the way down the ballot.      The longer this thing drags out, the more unpopular the Republican presidential pretenders become. Just look at Mitt Romney's trajectory, which followed Herman Cain's trajectory, and Newt Gingrich's trajectory, and Michelle Bachmann's trajectory, and so on.      Rick Santorum will inevitably follow the same path once he gets properly vetted. Mitt Romney has been unable to stem the bleeding despite his tens of millions. Just imagine Santorum, with the far more radical record and a continued inability to raise real money.      It's a no-brainer!

After young squire Sir Johan wins in a jousting tournament in his kingdom, his friend Peewit, the kingdom's court jester dwarf, celebrates by singing a victory song, with only one problem; he is so terrible a singer he drives the whole kingdom into hiding (not to mention attracting a powerful thunderstorm), and only Johan was kind enough to escort Peewit back to the castle in the rain.The next morning, a musical instrument merchant arrives in front of the castle to sell instruments to Peewit, but only the nameless King and Johann are present to meet him. After being offered some obnoxious instruments, Johan and the King angrily send off the merchant, who accidentally leaves behind one of the instruments offered - a peculiar flute with only 6 holes! When Peewit almost takes notice, Johann and the King sneak the flute off into the castle to destroy it before he can find it. They throw it in the King's fireplace, but the fire emanates green smoke that permeates the King's room! Peewit is among those who try to put the fire out, and much to the dismay of Johan and the King, he finds the flute in the ashes. But once Peewit cleans the flute and goes around the kingdom playing it, he is delighted to make a surprising discovery; once played, the flute causes anyone who hears it to dance uncontrollably and subsequently pass out from exhaustion. Just as Peewit is enjoying tormenting everyone with this newfound gift, the same merchant as before is offering instruments to the owner of a bar in town. When he is worried to notice (and mentions) that the odd 6-holed flute he had was missing, he is overheard by a shady bearded fat man named Matthew Oilycreep (AKA: Matthew McCreep), who makes inquiries about the flute to the merchant, who recalls that he dropped it at the front of the kingdom while offering it to Peewit.

She was launched on 27 August 1887 and Vizeadmiral (Vice Admiral) Alexander von Monts, the chief of the Marinestation der Nordsee (North Sea Naval Station) christened the ship. In early 1888, she was transferred to Wilhelmshaven, where her armament was installed, and she was commissioned on 9 August to begin sea trials. These concluded on 13 December in Wilhelmshaven. She was temporarily assigned to the newly-created Reserve Division of the North Sea over the winter of 1888–1889 before being transferred to Kiel on 1 May to begin engine trials, after which she was assigned to the Maneuver Squadron. During training exercises with the squadron, Wacht suffered a burst boiler tube on 20 June that forced her to return to port for repairs. In early August, she joined the squadron for a visit to Britain, arriving back in Wilhelmshaven on 31 August. The fleet then conducted its annual large-scale maneuvers.

ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- On a plot of soil, nestled against the backdrop of skyscrapers in downtown Atlanta, Georgia, a group of residents are turning a lack of access to fresh produce into a revival of old traditions and self-empowerment. Urban farming is a way for African-Americans to connect with the earth, says Cashawn Myers of HABESHA. HABESHA Gardens is one of many urban gardens sprouting up around the country. Fruits and vegetables are thriving in this community garden located in an economically depressed area of the city known as Mechanicsville. But the garden serves an even greater purpose. The harvest helps feed some of the neediest members of the neighborhood. \\"It's a reawakening going on. It's almost like it's a renaissance,\\" says Cashawn Myers, director of HABESHA Inc. \\"There's a Ghanaian proverb that says Sankofa. Sankofa means return to your past so you can move forward.

Going on a vacation is typically a time for relaxation, leisure, and enjoyment, allowing individuals to take a break from their daily routine, work, and other responsibilities. People embark on vacations to explore new places, experience different cultures, create unforgettable memories, and indulge in a variety of activities. One of the primary goals of a vacation is to have fun and create an enjoyable experience for everyone involved. Travelers often choose destinations that cater to their interests and preferences, whether it be lounging on beautiful beaches, engaging in adrenaline-inducing adventures, or exploring the culinary delights of a foreign country. While some people might experience brief moments of panic or debate during the planning process or due to unexpected circumstances, these feelings are not the primary focus of a vacation. Similarly, although vacations can sometimes lead to debt if not managed responsibly, it's not the primary intent for most people when they embark on a trip. In addition, people may also seek a sense of peace during their vacations, hoping to escape the stressors of daily life and find tranquility in their chosen destination. But, it is important to note that seeking peace in itself is often a part of the pursuit for having fun, as feeling serene and relaxed can undoubtedly make the experience more enjoyable.

Given these facts, what can cause sinkholes among the following options: - Solid bedrock  - rivers  - mines  - Drought  - Rain  - Evaporation  - coal  - storms The answer is:","output":"Sinkholes are formed by the dissolution of soluble rocks, like limestone, dolomite, and gypsum, due to the circulation of water through the underground bedrock. Among the options provided, the factors that can contribute to the formation of sinkholes are: 1. Rivers: Rivers can carry and move water through underground channels in soluble bedrock, causing the dissolution of rocks and leading to the formation of sinkholes over time. 2. Mines: Mining activity can cause the removal of support in the underground rock layers. As the support is lost, the overlying rock and soil can collapse, leading to the formation of sinkholes. 3. Rain: Rain, also known as precipitation, plays a significant role in the formation of sinkholes. Rainwater is slightly acidic due to the presence of carbon dioxide in the air. When it seeps into the ground, it dissolves soluble rocks, forming cavities and voids. Over time, these spaces can collapse, causing sinkholes to form on the surface. 4. Storms: Intense storms can lead to heavy rainfall, increasing the rate of dissolution of soluble bedrock. Additionally, stormwater runoff can cause erosion, which can contribute to the formation of sinkholes. Drought, evaporation, coal, and solid bedrock are not direct causes of sinkholes. Drought and evaporation can indirectly influence the process by affecting the availability of water needed to dissolve soluble rocks, but they do not cause sinkholes by themselves. Coal and solid bedrock do not contribute to the formation of sinkholes, as they are not soluble rock types that can be easily dissolved by water."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

CONTEXT: 11 de enero de 2006 Irán reinició su programa de investigación nuclear este martes (10), según anunció el Organismo Internacional de Energía Atómica (OIEA), añadiendo que \\"la investigación incluirá enriquecimiento de uranio a pequeña escala, utilizable en plantas de energía o en armas\\". \\"Hay una diferencia entre la investigación y la producción de combustible nuclear... la producción de combustible nuclear sigue suspendida\\", afirmó Mohammad Saeedi, de la Organización de Energía Atómica de Irán. Estados Unidos ha dicho que cualquier enriquecimiento de uranio es una \\"seria intensificación [del conflicto]\\". Un vocero de la Casa Blanca afirmó también que Irán se arriesga a una remisión al Consejo de Seguridad de las Naciones Unidas, organismo que puede imponer sanciones si continúa con su actual senda nuclear. Por su parte, el ministro británico de Asuntos Exteriores Jack Straw dijo que el conflicto con Irán debe resolverse por vías diplomáticas y que la \\"acción militar no está en nuestros planes\\". Mohamed ElBaradei, director del OIEA, les dijo a los 35 países que encabezan el organismo que \\"Irán tenía la intención de realizar un enriquecimiento de uranio limitado en sus instalaciones de Natanz, donde rompió los sellos de la ONU ante los inspectores del OIEA\\". \\"Irán planea instalar una cascada ultracentrífuga de gas a pequeña escala en su planta piloto de enriquecimiento de combustible en Natanz\\", dijo un diplomático occidental mientras leía el informe de ElBaradei. Los diplomáticos europeos habían dicho que convocarán una reunión de emergencia del OIEA para considerar la remisión de Teherán a la ONU para mayores acciones o sanciones. Los EUA dijeron que \\"esto ahora parece inevitable\\". Teherán niega querer la tecnología nuclear más que para programas civiles de energía a fin de satisfacer la \\"creciente\\" demanda de electricidad del país. Las potencias occidentales parecen hacer caso omiso de las afirmaciones iraníes y dicen que ese país \\"debe abstenerse de cualquier trabajo que pueda ayudar al desarrollo de armas atómicas\\". La Unión Europea dijo que la más reciente acción iraní \\"hace perder la confianza internacional en la naturaleza pacífica de su programa nuclear\\". En Berlín, el ministro de Exteriores alemán Frank-Walter Steinmeier advirtió que Irán había \\"cruzado un límite\\" al remover los sellos de sus plantas nucleares. El alto funcionario dijo que esperaba \\"que los iraníes sepan que pueden enfrentar consecuencias como resultado de su acción\\" y añadió que espera que Teherán vuelva al \\"camino de la razón\\". China también le pidió a Irán que prosiga el diálogo con el Reino Unido, Francia y Alemania. El vocero del ministro de exteriores chino Kong Quan declaró que \\"todas las partes deben mostrar moderación y hacer esfuerzos para construir la confianza mutua\\". La cadena iraní de noticias Khabar informó que el parlamento de ese país apoyó la decisión del presidente Mahmud Ahmadineyad de reiniciar el trabajo de investigación, calificándolo de \\"fuente de orgullo nacional\\".

Read the following context and answer the question. Context: When I had trouble bending over to tie my shoes and I wasn’t pregnant. When I hit about 35 I started having trouble with weight. The strange thing was to me, it wasn’t that I was eating more then I used to, as a matter of fact I started eating less. When that didn’t help I barely ate at all. Still I couldn’t lose weight. What I didn’t know was we start to lose muscle mass every decade beginning in our thirties, and I was a ripe 35. Muscles use up more calories than fat, so less muscle means a slower metabolism and the need for fewer calories, and the pounds stack on easier. My second problem was my narcolepsy. When you wake up after a nights sleep there is a release of adrenaline which prompts body and mind into action and helps burn off calories. Narcolepsy causes me to sleep on and off during the day, and as explained by my doctor (so if I have this wrong about adrenaline it is my doctors fault lol) I am not getting that adrenaline release because my bodies clock doesn’t know if I am asleep or awake. He suggested in the morning to start exercising about 20 minutes to get that adrenaline rush, in the afternoon exercise about twenty minutes more for the same reason… Dieting and exercising brought those pounds back down. I will say it is much harder in the winter for me then in the summer. Summer time I am naturally active. I ride bikes with my husband, swim, garden, mow about an acre of lawn. In the winter I can’t ride, swim, garden, or mow, and I hate exercise I don’t enjoy. Anyway the long answer to the defining moment but there it is just the same.

The context mentions that Saints John's church dome, which was decorated by Palonino, contains some of the best frescoes in Spain, which implies a considerable degree of artistic skill and recognition. Palonino's artistic contributions to this church have made it an important focal point in the region, and have immortalized his work as being among Spain's finest in the realm of frescoes. The information supplied illustrates the significance of various prominent architectural sites in the area: Parish churches, including Saints John (Baptist and Evangelist), the Knights Templar's El Templo, the former convent of the Dominicans, the Colegio del Corpus Christi, the Jesuit college, and the Colegio de San Juan. These religious and educational institutions signify the rich historical background and artwork that the region boasts. It is important to note that the art created by Palonino in Saints John's Church holds a particular prominence within the context mentioned. Frescoes, as a form of mural painting, involve applying pigments on wet plaster, allowing the art to become an integral part of the wall or ceiling. This technique, which requires exceptional skill and precision, suggests that Palonino was a master in his field. Consequently, his contributions to the church's dome substantially impacted the recognition and allure of the entire site. Although the context focuses primarily on the architectural settings, Palonino's fundamental role in shaping the artistic reputation of Saints John's Church should not be understated. His remarkable frescoes continue to draw people from around the world, contributing to Spain's unique blend of cultural heritage and artistic tradition and placing him at the forefront of those responsible for the art of the one best known for art in the specified context."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: So, I worked with a friend of mine who was a playwright to put together a play to take to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival. It was a three person show, and one of the roles was written specifically for me. Many of the lines were written after we improvised the scenes in my living room as she wrote the piece. Took it to Scotland, where it was quite well received. A year or so later, it was being produced in New York in a much more prestigious setting. I auditioned, was called back a couple times, and got to the play the role again. Fantastic! THEN, it was produced by an even larger theatre. Different producer, different casting director, etc. I went to the open call for it, and the casting director treated me really poorly. It was odd. She looked at my resume and said, “It says you have already played this role.” I said, “Yes, I was fortunate enough to workshop it and originate the role.” She looked at me like I was lying. I mean, shuttled me out the door like I was a crazy woman. Needless to say, I was not called back. And that was okay—(I mean, of course I wanted to do the show with this group of people, but hey, we can’t always get what we want). Fast forward to opening night: my playwright friend invites me to see the show. The actress playing “my” role was fantastic, but they had to change lines in the script that indicated what she looked like, because she was of Hawaiian descent. Again, no big deal…and she was great! What was strange was meeting the director that evening. My friend introduced me as the originator of the role, and the director asked me why I hadn’t auditioned…Overall, it wasn’t a harsh rejection or a terrible story, it was just weird to have been treated like a liar when I was not lying… Question: How does the actress feel about the playwright?

Title: Golden Age of TV and Jazz Product review: From the first note, you know you're watching history in the making. Then, you realize that this is not a recorded theme song. It's actually the Cannonball Adderley Sextet playing behind the opening credits. Jazz Scene USA was a short-lived TV showcase of jazz. Filmed in black & white, the cameras work in sympathy with the players. Every nuance of the performance is captured down to the vibrations of the bass strings. Having been born in 1969 and having seen too much TV, it is my opinion that television's golden age has come and gone. For me the best shows (Twilight Zone, The Honeymooners, Star Trek, etc.) were made between 1952 and 1969. DVD is the perfect medium to revive these old shows. Now they need to reissue other, more recent music programs from TV like David Sandborn's \\"Night Music\\" (early 1990's) series and PBS' \\"Sessions On West 54th\\".

For that, he conducted two tests. In the first test, he used warmer reactants. He called it reactant A. In the second test, he used cooler reactants. He called it reactant B.  and a hint : When the temperature of reactants is higher, the rate of the reaction is faster. At higher temperatures, particles of reactants have more energy, so they move faster. As a result, they are more likely to bump into one another and to collide with greater force. For example, food spoils because of chemical reactions, and these reactions occur faster at higher temperatures (see the bread on the left in the Figure below ).

She wanted to eat some icecream but ate candy instead, because her teeth can stand warm food like the","output":"candy she picked up from her last visit to the confectionery shop. The shop, called Delights Galore, was known for its wide assortment of candy and sweets that made children and adults alike giddy with excitement. The shopkeepers claimed that they sourced these treats from every corner of the world, so there was always something new and delightful to discover. Candy, in all its various forms and flavors, was the perfect compromise for her sensitive teeth. Warm food was gentle on her teeth, whereas cold food would send a shiver down her spine due to the sharp pain that would radiate from her mouth. While the doctor's advice had been to take things slowly and to avoid cold food for awhile, she couldn't resist her desires. As she unwrapped the candy and popped it into her mouth, she closed her eyes and began to savor the taste. The candy started with a sweet crunch on the outside, quickly dissolving to reveal a gooey, fruity center. The flavors danced on her tongue, reminiscent of a tropical paradise she visited on her best vacation ever. That vacation was a dream come true; a month spent traveling the world and exploring every bit of it she could. From historic landmarks to exotic cuisine, she'd done it all. The memory of those sun-soaked days filled her with nostalgia, and the candy was a modest token of that trip. It allowed her a moment of escape from the humdrum life she led now. Though the candy was a delectable reminder of the adventure that stretched beneath the glittering sun, it was still no substitute for the ice cream she longed for. She remembered the subtle flavor varieties of ice cream churned out by the seaside ice cream parlors that filled the air with an intoxicating aroma. How she wished she could experience that again without fear of the cold-induced pain. Perhaps she could; she had an idea. Her friend Lucy once mentioned a recipe for homemade ice cream. But being the problem-solver that she was, she thought to herself, \\"what if I take that recipe and create something warm? Would that not bring a semblance of that beautiful moment back to life?” She spent hours researching, experimenting, and perfecting her recipe. In the end, she'd done it! Her creation – warm, velvety, and custard-like – was a testament to her creativity and passion. One spoonful was all it took to transport her back to the seaside, basking in the sun, with waves crashing on the shore. Her innovation did not go unnoticed. Friends, neighbors, and family members clamored to try the unique dessert that captured the essence of ice cream but met the approval of her sensitive teeth. Soon enough, word of her creation began to spread around town. Enthralled by her newfound culinary discovery, she decided to open a small cafe, offering her delicious warm ice cream alongside other traditional desserts. Although some skeptics were hesitant to try it at first, they soon realized that it was an experience to remember. This new creation garnered the attention of food enthusiasts and critics alike, bringing her a level of fame she had never imagined. The cafe, dubbed “Warm Whispers,” soon became a local favorite, and the young woman's once ordinary life blossomed into something extraordinary. She continued to innovate and try new things, never forgetting the roots of her inspiration, the teeth sensitivity that led her to this incredible journey. She helped revolutionize the dessert scene, proving that even with limitations, one can find creative ways to enjoy the things they love. In a way, she got to live her vacation over and over again, as she crafted desserts that were reminiscent of her travels. Now, children and adults alike can walk into her cafe, bask in the cozy atmosphere, and take a bite of that warm, inviting, and nostalgic taste that she had lovingly crafted. One woman's desire for ice cream turned into a creative alternative that was enjoyed by many. Through hard work, determination, and an unwavering passion, she turned her limitations into sweet opportunities that changed not only her life but also the lives of those who savored her creations."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer:","output":"The newspaper you are referring to, of which David Dinsmore is a former editor, is The Sun. The Sun, a British tabloid newspaper, was originally launched as a broadsheet on September 15, 1964, by the International Publishing Corporation (IPC). It replaced the defunct Daily Herald. However, its circulation began to decline, and in 1969, Rupert Murdoch's News Corp acquired the newspaper. On November 17, 1969, Rupert Murdoch relaunched The Sun as a tabloid newspaper. He wanted to turn the struggling newspaper into a more dynamic and sensationalist daily publication that would appeal to a wider audience. It was at this time that The Sun transformed into the tabloid that it is known as today. The move to a tabloid format significantly impacted the overall style and content of the paper, focusing more on human-interest stories, sports, and sensational news items. Today, The Sun remains one of the largest daily newspapers in the United Kingdom. David Dinsmore served as the editor of The Sun from June 2013 to September 2015. He played a significant role in overseeing the paper's direction during his tenure. In 2015, he was succeeded by Tony Gallagher, who is the current editor of the newspaper."},{"instruction":"Given the following context:  Candaules, King of Lydia, Shews his Wife by Stealth to Gyges, One of his Ministers, as She Goes to Bed, occasionally formerly known as The Imprudence of Candaules, is a 45.1 by 55.9 cm (17.8 by 22.0 in) oil painting on canvas by English artist William Etty, first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1830. It shows a scene from the Histories by Herodotus, in which Candaules, king of Lydia, invites his bodyguard Gyges to hide in the couple's bedroom and watch his wife Nyssia undress, to prove to him her beauty. Nyssia notices Gyges spying and challenges him to either accept his own execution or to kill Candaules as a punishment. Gyges chooses to kill Candaules and take his place as king. The painting shows the moment at which Nyssia, still unaware that she is being watched by anyone other than her husband, removes the last of her clothes. Etty hoped that his audience would take from the painting the moral lesson that women are not chattels and that men infringing on their rights should justly be punished, but he made little effort to explain this to audiences. The painting was immediately controversial and perceived as a cynical combination of a pornographic image and a violent and unpleasant narrative, and it was condemned as an immoral piece of the type one would expect from a foreign, not a British, artist. It was bought by Robert Vernon on its exhibition, and in 1847 was one of a number of paintings given by Vernon to the nation. The work retained its controversial reputation in later years, and when The Art Journal bought the reproduction rights to Vernon's former collection in 1849 they did not distribute reproductions of Candaules. In 1929 it was among several paintings transferred to the newly expanded Tate Gallery, where as of 2018 it remains.  answer the following question:  Where does the painting that not get distribution of reproductions reside today?","output":"The painting resides at the Tate Gallery."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Greg and Paul were two neighbors. They were both into mycology. Greg researched AM fungi, while Paul studied other types of mycorrhizal fungi.  Which researcher learned more about AM fungi reallocating their resources to intraradical hyphae?  Hint: Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi vary across many environmental gradients. Their tolerance to freezing and drying is known to shift between AM fungal taxa. AM fungi become less prevalent and diverse at higher soil nutrient and moisture concentrations, presumably because both plants allocate less carbon to AM fungi and AM fungi reallocate their resources to intraradical hyphae in these environmental conditions. Over the long term, these environmental conditions can even create local adaptation between plant hosts, AM fungi and the local soil nutrient concentrations. A:","output":"To answer this question, I will first analyze the given information and then compare the knowledge of the two researchers. Step 1: Analyze the information provided - Arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi vary across environmental gradients. - Their tolerance to freezing and drying shifts between AM fungal taxa. - AM fungi become less prevalent and diverse in higher soil nutrient and moisture concentrations. - In these conditions, plants allocate less carbon to AM fungi, and AM fungi reallocate their resources to intraradical hyphae. - Long-term environmental conditions can create local adaptation between plant hosts, AM fungi, and local soil nutrient concentrations. Step 2: Compare the knowledge of Greg and Paul - Greg researched AM fungi. - Paul studied other types of mycorrhizal fungi (not specifically AM fungi). Step 3: Determine which researcher learned more about AM fungi reallocating their resources to intraradical hyphae Since Greg specifically researched AM fungi, it is likely that he learned more about their characteristics, including their resource allocation to intraradical hyphae. Paul, on the other hand, studied other types of mycorrhizal fungi and may not have focused as much on the specific traits of AM fungi. Conclusion: Greg, who researched AM fungi, likely learned more about AM fungi reallocating their resources to intraradical hyphae."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Choose option [a] for tying an overhand knot, as it provides the correct technique for forming the knot. Option [b] does not result in the desired outcome. 2. To begin, I would take a piece of string, rope, or cord to be knotted. Choosing the right material ensures the knot will hold securely and function as intended. 3.

Toshi, the protagonist of this narrative, reflects on an earlier performance which may have been evidently awkward or uncomfortable for him. During an interview, presumably with a journalist or a media personality, Toshi opens up about an acting or artistic experience that took place on stage. The use of \\"great embarrassment\\" emphasizes the level of distress or unease that Toshi associates with this past event. However, without further context, it is difficult to pinpoint the exact nature of Toshi's stage experience. It could range from a failed performance, a wardrobe malfunction, or even an emotional or mental breakdown while being on stage. It can be inferred that the incident had a significant impact on Toshi, to the point where it was still ingrained in his memory during the interview. It is likely that the intent behind sharing this story in the interview is to humanize Toshi, allowing the audience to empathize with him and see that even successful individuals face difficult situations in their professional journeys. Additionally, discussing it might have been a cathartic move for Toshi, providing him a chance to be open and honest about an unpleasant memory that, in hindsight, shaped his career or personal growth. In conclusion, Toshi's disclosure of his embarrassing stage experience serves as a window into the vulnerability and struggles faced by artists and performers, allowing us to see that they are not immune to mishaps.

Q: SEOUL — Despite recent tensions over North Korea’s nuclear and missile tests, life is actually quite normal for American military families living at Camp Humphreys in South Korea, which is the largest overseas Army installation in the world. Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Puskas tries to come to most of his daughters’ high school soccer games at Camp Humphreys. In fact, his family’s lifestyle at this sprawling U.S. military base is similar to one they would lead back home. “We go to church on Sundays. We see all our friends there. We’re on the soccer field most of the afternoons, or just going for bike ride, the same things we would do if we were back in the States,” said Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Puskas, with the U.S. Eight Army. This is Puskas’ fourth tour in Korea. He met and married his Korean wife Mi-jung, during an earlier tour. His children have spent much of their lives at military bases in Korea. “I think it has given me a wider world view and has helped me understand other people a lot more,” said Elizabeth Puskas, the eldest daughter of the family who will attend college next year in the United States. The U.S. military in Korea is consolidating its forces in Camp Humphreys, including its military headquarters, as it moves to close older bases in congested Seoul and other regions of the country. Camp Humphreys is now the size of a small city, encompassing over 140 square kilometers of land, with construction underway to expand its capacity to accommodate over 40,000 people. There are modern apartments for soldiers and their families, schools, movie theaters, shopping centers and fast food restaurants to help bring some of the comforts of home to military life in Korea. The base even has its own golf course. “I have been around the army for part of the last 40 years as a soldier and now as a civilian, and this is as normal as any army post I’ve ever been on.

Write an article based on this \\"Aberdeen MP Kirsty Blackman is to step down from Westminster's Scottish Affairs Committee to spend more time in her constituency.\\"","output":"Title: Kirsty Blackman Leaves Scottish Affairs Committee to Focus on Constituency Aberdeen MP Kirsty Blackman has recently announced her decision to step down from her role on Westminster's Scottish Affairs Committee to spend more time tending to the needs and demands of her constituency. This move marks a significant shift in her political focus and will enable her to better serve the people of Aberdeen North, whom she has represented since 2015. The Scottish Affairs Committee, comprised of a cross-party group of MPs, is responsible for scrutinizing the actions and decisions of the UK government as well as other organizations that have an impact on Scotland. The Committee plays a vital role in ensuring that the needs of the Scottish population are taken into account when making decisions at the national level. Kirsty Blackman, a member of the Scottish National Party (SNP), has served on this Committee for several years, actively participating in debates, inquiries, and research to better understand the implications of various policies for Scotland. Her decision to step down comes as she realizes the importance of truly understanding the challenges faced by her constituents, particularly in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Blackman's departure from the Scottish Affairs Committee will enable her to focus on the unique challenges faced by Aberdeen North, a diverse constituency with a population of over 80,000, consisting of urban centers, smaller towns, and vast rural areas. By being more present in her constituency, Blackman aims to identify and tackle these issues more effectively and to give a stronger voice to her constituents in the Scottish and UK parliaments. The importance of spending time in one's constituency cannot be overstated for a Member of Parliament. This allows them to build and maintain strong relationships with their constituents and keep their finger on the pulse of local concerns and aspirations. In turn, this enables MPs to better represent the broader context of the community and to inform their decision-making and voting records in Parliament. Aberdeen North has faced various challenges over recent years, ranging from the city's dwindling oil industry, high unemployment rates, affordable housing, and ongoing issues related to poverty and homelessness. Another key issue requiring attention in the area is the continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, including its effects on the local economy, essential services such as healthcare, and education. By more actively engaging with the locals, community leaders, and various stakeholders, Kirsty Blackman will be better equipped to address these pressing concerns and work on viable solutions. This approach requires liaising with a mix of institutions, businesses, and individuals to identify the best possible outcomes for all parties involved. In addition to working on local issues, Blackman's departure from the Scottish Affairs Committee does not signify that she will disengage from matters of national and international importance. She will continue to make her voice heard on key issues such as Scotland's independence, climate change, and social justice, using her increased understanding of her constituent's needs to inform her positions on these topics. In conclusion, Kirsty Blackman's decision to step down from Westminster's Scottish Affairs Committee to dedicate more time to her Aberdeen North constituency demonstrates her commitment to her constituents and a willingness to listen, learn, and address their challenges and aspirations. As she takes on this new, locally-focused challenge, her constituents can expect a more accessible, accountable, and informed representative, ready to fight for their interests both at home and on the national stage."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Chief Executive Evan Spiegel and Chief Technology Officer Robert Murphy acknowledged that their former fraternity brother, Frank Reginald Brown IV, was integral to the birth of their popular app, where 700 million disappearing messages are sent every day. The settlement comes just a fortnight after Snapchat was valued at £6 billion (10 billion). Snapchat's Chief Executive Evan Spiegel (pictured left)  and Chief Technology Officer Robert Murphy (right) acknowledged that their former classmate, Frank Reginald Brown IV, was integral to the birth of their popular app, from which 700 million disappearing messages are sent every day 'From spring of 2011 and into the summer,' reads Brown's filing, '[Brown] and","output":"Spiegel and Murphy conceived, worked on, and built the prototype for, the product that would eventually become the wildly successful Snapchat application and which the Appellees ultimately launched in September of 2011.' Brown claimed that he was a co-founder and that his contributions to the original concept and design of the app warranted recognition and monetary compensation. Following a legal back-and-forth between the parties, the case was scheduled for trial. In the midst of preparing for the potentially damaging and high-profile lawsuit, Snapchat faced external challenges as well. While the company continued to grow at an astonishing pace, bolstering partnerships with major brands and expanding their user base, competitors like Instagram and Facebook introduced similar features, aiming to capture a slice of the ephemeral messaging market. Amidst these mounting challenges, it became apparent to Spiegel, Murphy, and Brown that resolving the lawsuit would prove beneficial to everyone involved. In September 2014, the three sat down for negotiations, hoping to reach an amicable agreement that acknowledged Brown's contributions. After several days of discussion, they finally settled on an undisclosed sum. Brown's lawyer announced that the settlement amount was 'mutually satisfactory,' and the lawsuit was dismissed, allowing for all parties to move on from the conflict. Once the case was resolved, the now-acknowledged co-founder Frank Reginald Brown IV released a public statement expressing his relief at the settlement. 'I am gratified that the dispute has now been resolved and my contributions to the initial creation of Snapchat have been recognized,' he said. 'I am now looking forward to pursuing new opportunities and continuing to innovate.' With the lawsuit behind them, Spiegel, Murphy, and Brown were able to focus on their individual pursuits, as they had all learned valuable lessons from the experience. Snapchat continued to thrive as an essential digital communication platform, maintaining its strong user base and devising new ways to generate revenue. Brown, with his considerable financial settlement, pursued personal projects and continued to innovate, venturing into the technology industry by investing in various start-ups. In the years following the settlement, Snapchat continued to evolve while facing increased competition. Spiegel and Murphy remained committed to driving the company forward as they implemented new features, advertising strategies, and partnerships. Meanwhile, Brown took the knowledge and experience he had gained from the creation of Snapchat and channeled it into new endeavors. Ultimately, the story ended with each of the three parties acknowledging their respective roles in the creation and success of Snapchat. They were able to settle their differences and close this particular chapter in their lives, moving forward wiser and with a greater understanding of the value of collaboration, communication, and innovation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:I read this background article the other day: Farsightedness, or hyperopia, is the condition in which distant objects are seen clearly, but nearby objects appear blurry. It occurs when the eyeball is shorter than normal (see Figure below ). This causes images to be focused in a spot that would fall behind the retina (if light could pass through the retina). Hyperopia can be corrected with convex lenses. The lenses focus images farther forward in the eye, so they fall on the retina instead of behind it.

Summarize this article: For Americans across the nation, housing expenses are typically the largest costs of living. Not only is a house the biggest purchase in most Americans’ lives, but also monthly rent or mortgage payments often exceed what is spent on food, luxury, savings, and transportation combined. Similarly, property taxes make up the bulk of taxes paid each year by most people in the United States.      Property taxation is almost always done at the state and local level. A range of government bodies, including cities, counties, school boards, safety departments, and utility commissions, levy property taxes in a variety of ways.      Of the 3.1 trillion in taxes the federal government collected in fiscal 2014, more than two-thirds came from income and payroll taxes. Only 1% came from estate and trust taxes — levied on the exchange of property after death and perhaps the only federal tax that could be considered a property tax.      Click here to see the states with the highest (and lowest) property taxes.      Using data from the Tax Foundation, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed property taxes paid in each state as a percentage of home values. The effective property tax rate is as high as 2.38% in New Jersey, and as low as 0.28% in Hawaii.      Compared to sales, income, corporate, and other forms of taxation, property taxes make up the largest share of state and local tax collections in 26 states. In most cases this was due to the high effective tax rate. In a few states the absence of other major tax types could explain the disproportionate reliance on property taxation. Of the 25 states with the highest property tax rates, Delaware, Wyoming, Virginia, Montana, and Nevada residents do not pay at least one major tax whatsoever. Six of the 25 states levying the lowest property tax rates also do not have at least one major tax.      In 16 of the top 25 states, property taxes make up at least a third of state and local tax collections. In New Hampshire, more than two-thirds of state and local taxes come from property taxes. Of the 25 states collecting the lowest property tax rates, property taxes accounted for one-third or more of collections in only four states. General sales or other taxes tended to comprise the bulk of taxes collected by these states.      Home values are taken into consideration by state and local governments when determining property tax rates. Values can also often dictate how much revenue state and local governments collect in the form of property taxes. However, the states with the highest property tax rates do not necessarily have the most expensive housing markets, nor do low-tax states necessarily have relatively low home values.      New Jersey, New Hampshire, Vermont, Connecticut, and New York are each home to some of the highest property tax rates nationwide as well as some of the highest home values. Other states such as Wisconsin, Texas, and Nebraska, however, also have relatively high property tax rates but also below average home values.      Hawaii, where the typical owner-occupied housing unit is valued at 528,000 — the highest in the country — also has the lowest effective property tax rate of any state.      To identify the states with the highest and lowest property taxes, 24/7 Wall St. reviewed 2013 average effective property tax rates on owner-occupied housing in each state from the Tax Foundation. Taxes paid by businesses, renters, and others were excluded from the Tax Foundation’s calculation. Total property tax collections per capita from 2006 through 2013, the sources of tax collections by tax type for 2012, and state and local tax burdens as a percentage of state income for each state in 2013 also came from the Tax Foundation. Property tax collections are based on the average property tax deduction taken on the Schedule A, per tax return, from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). While this is not equivalent to the average property collections at the state level, this estimate is often used as an estimate. Cost of living figures in 2013 for each state came from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). Household median income, median home value, and poverty rates came from the U.S. Census Bureau’s 2014 American Community Survey (ACS).      These are the states with the highest and lowest property tax rates. ||||| 5.

He was voted the \\"10th Greatest Guitarist\\" by Guitar World magazine, and has sold over 15 million records. A three-time Grammy Award winner and fifteen-time nominee, Vai started his music career in 1978 at the age of 18 as a transcriptionist for Frank Zappa, and joined his band from 1980 to 1983. He embarked on a solo career in 1983 and has released eight solo albums to date. Steve Vai, a descendant of Italian immigrants, was born in Carle Place, New York on June 6, 1960. He is the fourth son of John and Theresa Vai. He described his first experiences with music as, \\"at the age of five I walked up to [a] piano, hit a note, and noticed that to the right the notes go higher and to the left the notes go lower. In that very moment, I had a full-on epiphany. I was flooded with the instinctual realization of how music was created and how it worked from a theoretical standpoint--the whole language of music was very obvious. I also understood immediately, instinctually, and unequivocally something that has only deepened through the years that the creation of music is an infinite personal expression. I realized that I could do this, I could make music, and it could be whatever I want.\\"  It was a year later, at the age of six, that Vai experienced his first introduction to the guitar, remembering that, \\"I saw this nine-year-old boy playing the guitar in my grade school auditorium, and that was another epiphany that I had. It was my first recognition of the instrument. When I saw that guitar and I saw this kid playing it, I knew instinctually that I was going to play the guitar someday, and that it would be my instrument. Don't ask me how I knew, I just knew. It was the coolest thing I had ever seen.\\"  As a young child, Vai was influenced by the music his parents had listened to. One album in particular that he cites as his \\"musical awakening\\" was the original motion picture soundtrack to the 1961 film West Side Story. At age eleven, Vai was introduced to the contemporary rock and progressive music of the era, and after hearing the guitar solo to Led Zeppelin's \\"Heartbreaker\\" at age twelve, decided to begin playing the guitar.  In 1973, Vai began to take guitar lessons from fellow New York native Joe Satriani, and played in local bands (The Ohio Express, Circus, and Rayge) throughout his high school years. Vai cites artists such as Jimmy Page, Brian May, Ritchie Blackmore, Jeff Beck, Jimi Hendrix, as well as jazz fusion guitarists Allan Holdsworth and Al Di Meola as some of his major influences in that time period. In 1978, to further pursue his interest in music composition and theory, Vai attended Berklee College of Music in Boston, Massachusetts. While at Berklee, Vai began working for Frank Zappa as a transcriptionist, and in the middle of his fourth semester, moved to California to start his career as a session and touring artist for Zappa. Also while at Berklee, Vai met his future spouse Pia Maiocco, with whom he has been together since; they have two children. In 2000, Vai was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Music from Berklee.

What evidence supports this claim?","output":"The claim that the sports world is unfairly dominated by a male-orientated world-view is supported by several pieces of evidence. This evidence can be seen through various aspects, including media coverage, pay disparity, representation in leadership, and cultural perception. Here, we will outline a detailed analysis of each area. 1. Media coverage: One of the most apparent examples of male dominance in the sports world is the disproportionate amount of media coverage for male and female athletes. Various studies have shown that women's sports only receive a small fraction of sports media coverage. For instance, a 25-year longitudinal study conducted by the University of Southern California's Center for Feminist Research indicates that despite the growing popularity of women's sports, media coverage has remained relatively stagnant, with women receiving only 4.9% of all media coverage globally. 2. Pay disparity: The gender pay gap is another significant issue in the world of sports. The salaries of male athletes, particularly in popular sports like soccer, basketball, and tennis, are considerably higher than their female counterparts. For example, Forbes' 2021 list of highest-paid athletes did not include a single woman among the top 50. This clear pay disparity is also evident in prize money for various sports competitions around the world. Despite some sports having equal prize money, like in tennis majors, others continue to have substantial pay differences. 3. Representation in leadership and coaching roles: Another crucial aspect that supports the claim of male dominance in sports is the underrepresentation of women in leadership roles within sports organizations. This extends to both coaching and administrative roles. Data from the Tucker Center for Research on Girls & Women in Sport reveals that only 42.9% of head coaches in collegiate women's sports are women. Additionally, looking at the larger sports organizations, such as the International Olympic Committee (IOC), only 33.3% of the members are women, while in the executive board, it's just 30.8% (data as of January 2021). 4. Cultural perception and sexism: In some societies, there is still a prevalent cultural perception that women are unsuitable for sports or cannot perform at the same level as men. This perception is further reinforced by the presence of stereotypes and media portrayals that often objectify female athletes, evaluating them based on their appearance rather than their athletic abilities. Similarly, female athletes often face sexism, prejudice, and underestimation of their achievements. This can contribute to female athletes receiving less sponsorship and marketing opportunities compared to their male counterparts. 5. Lack of resources and investment: The unequal distribution of resources and investment in women's sports is another factor that supports the claim of male dominance in the sports world. Many female athletes struggle with inadequate training facilities, lack of funding, and minimal support, resulting in a disparity in performance and development between male and female athletes in certain sports. Schools and colleges may also prioritize male sports programs which further perpetuates this disparity. In conclusion, the prevalence of male dominance in the sports world is evident through the disparities in media coverage, pay, representation in leadership roles, cultural perception, and the unequal distribution of resources and investment. The deeply entrenched presence of these factors reflects the male-orientated world-view dominating the sports industry, highlighting the need for social and institutional changes to ensure equal opportunities and recognition for all athletes, regardless of their gender."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What industry was hit by a global depression?, using the article: The Kingdom of Mysore reached a peak in economic power under Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan, in the post-Mughal era of the mid-late 18th century. They embarked on an ambitious program of economic development, aiming to increase the wealth and revenue of Mysore. Under their reign, Mysore overtook the Bengal Subah as India's dominant economic power, with productive agriculture and textile manufacturing.Tipu Sultan is credited with founding state trading depots in various locations of his kingdom. In addition, he founded depots in foreign locations such as Karachi, Jeddah and Muscat, where Mysore products were sold. During Tipu's rule French technology was used for the first time in carpentry and smithing, Chinese technology was used for sugar production, and technology from Bengal helped improve the sericulture industry. State factories were established in Kanakapura and Taramandelpeth for producing cannons and gunpowder respectively. The state held the monopoly in the production of essentials such as sugar, salt, iron, pepper, cardamom, betel nut, tobacco and sandalwood, as well as the extraction of incense oil from sandalwood and the mining of silver, gold and precious stones. Sandalwood was exported to China and the Persian Gulf countries and sericulture was developed in twenty-one centers within the kingdom.The Mysore silk industry was initiated during the rule of Tipu Sultan. Later the industry was hit by a global depression and competition from imported silk and rayon. In the second half of the 20th century, it however revived and the Mysore State became the top multivoltine silk producer in India.Under Tipu Sultan, Mysore enjoyed one of the world's highest real wages and living standards in the late 18th century, higher than Britain, which in turn had the highest living standards in Europe.

Question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What was the name of the person who supported himself in England? ?  In 1870, concerned at the dominance of German music and the lack of opportunity for young French composers to have their works played, Saint-Saëns and Romain Bussine, professor of singing at the Conservatoire, discussed the founding of a society to promote new French music. Before they could take the proposal further, the Franco-Prussian War broke out. Saint-Saëns served in the National Guard during the war. During the brief but bloody Paris Commune that followed, his superior at the Madeleine, the Abbé Deguerry, was murdered by rebels; Saint-Saëns was fortunate to escape to temporary exile in England where he arrived in May 1871. With the help of George Grove and others he supported himself while there, giving recitals. Returning to Paris in the same year, he found that anti-German sentiments had considerably enhanced support for the idea of a pro-French musical society. The Société Nationale de Musique, with its motto, \\"Ars Gallica\\", had been established in February 1871, with Bussine as president, Saint-Saëns as vice-president and Henri Duparc, Fauré, Franck and Jules Massenet among its founder-members. As an admirer of Liszt's innovative symphonic poems, Saint-Saëns enthusiastically adopted the form; his first \\"poème symphonique\\" was Le Rouet d'Omphale (1871), premiered at a concert of the Sociéte Nationale in January 1872. In the same year, after more than a decade of intermittent work on operatic scores, Saint-Saëns finally had one of his operas staged. La princesse jaune (\\"The Yellow Princess\\"), a one-act, light romantic piece, was given at the Opéra-Comique, Paris in June. It ran for five performances.Throughout the 1860s and early 1870s, Saint-Saëns had continued to live a bachelor existence, sharing a large fourth-floor flat in the Rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré with his mother. In 1875, he surprised many by marrying. The groom was approaching forty and his bride was nineteen; she was Marie-Laure Truffot, the sister of one of the composer's pupils. The marriage was not a success. In the words of the... Answer:","output":"The name of the person who supported himself in England is Camille Saint-Saëns.

Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","output":"Answer 1: Geography Day Celebrated on January 14 Geography Day is celebrated on January 14 to honor the birthday of Alexander von Humboldt, a Prussian geographer, naturalist, and explorer who significantly contributed to the field of geography. Born on September 14, 1769, Humboldt is best known for his exploration of Latin America, during which he collected a vast amount of data on the region's physical geography, climate, flora, and fauna. His work had a profound impact on geography as a discipline, as well as on the scientific community in general, as it stimulated further exploration and research in numerous fields. Among his most significant contributions are the concept of \\"isotherms\\" – the lines on a map that connect areas of equal temperatures – and his extensive research on climate zones. To honor his immense contributions, January 14 is celebrated as Geography Day to raise awareness about the importance of geography and its critical role in understanding our planet and its various natural phenomena. Answer 2: The Celebration of November 14 November 14 is celebrated for various reasons across the world, depending on the specific country or culture. In India, for example, November 14 is observed as Children's Day in remembrance of the birthday of Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister of India. Nehru had a special affection for children and was often affectionately referred to as \\"Chacha Nehru\\" (Uncle Nehru). The day emphasizes the importance of nurturing and educating children, who are the future of the nation. In another instance, World Diabetes Day is also observed on November 14. This global event was introduced in 1991 by the International Diabetes Federation (IDF) and the World Health Organization (WHO) to address the escalating health risks associated with diabetes. November 14 was chosen to honor the birthday of Sir Frederick Banting, who co-discovered insulin along with Charles Best in 1921. The day is aimed at raising awareness about diabetes, its prevention, and the importance of proper healthcare for people with diabetes. Conclusion:  Though they share a common purpose of raising awareness and honoring important personalities, the reasons for celebrating Geography Day on January 14 and November 14 events are not the same. Geography Day is specifically dedicated to celebrating the achievements of Alexander von Humboldt, while November 14 covers a variety of occasions such as Children's Day in India and World Diabetes Day. Each of these celebrations is unique and has its distinct significance."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

Still, he did not agree to align with the West, which was a common consequence of accepting American aid at the time. After Stalin's death in 1953, relations with the USSR were relaxed and he began to receive aid as well from the COMECON. In this way, Tito played East-West antagonism to his advantage.

Title: Balls of Fury Movie plot: Eleven year old Randy Daytona becomes anxious when he learns that his father Peter has bet on his performance in the 1988 Summer Olympics table tennis finals. During his first game between his opponent Karl Wolfschtagg from the German Democratic Republic, Daytona has an accident and suffers an injury. Unable to continue, he loses the match. Loan sharks in the employ of criminal mastermind Feng murder his father, and Daytona leaves competitive ping-pong. Nineteen years later, Daytona is dismissed from the Peppermill casino and meets FBI agent Ernie Rodriguez, who requests his assistance in arresting Feng for running guns. Feng's hidden jungle hideout hosts a black-market Ping-Pong tournament, and Daytona's invitation is a way for the FBI to infiltrate Feng's organization. When Daytona agrees, Rodriguez tells him to win enough championships that Feng's scouts notice him. After losing a local tournament, Daytona is apprenticed to a blind man in Chinatown named Wong, who was Feng's former mentor. Daytona also meets Wong's niece, Maggie. When locals vandalize Master Wong's house for violating their edict against teaching white people ping pong, Daytona is forced to play against \\"The Dragon\\", a young girl, in exchange for Wong's right to stay. After Daytona beats the Dragon, Feng's men take notice of his win and bring Daytona, Rodriguez, and Wong to Feng's facility.

After Daytona attempts unsuccessfully to escape, Feng invites him to join his side and reveals that he only finished half of Wong's training. He says it would be the ultimate satisfaction to win Daytona away from Wong. Feng also shows Daytona his specially modified ping-pong table.

From the 17th through 19th centuries, the merging of folk beliefs about group differences with scientific explanations of those differences produced what one scholar has called an \\"ideology of race\\". According to this ideology, races are primordial, natural, enduring and distinct.

Blot the liquid until there is very little left on the surface of the mattress. Do not rub the mattress to remove the liquid, as this will just make the liquid absorb more into the mattress. Take a few teaspoons of baking soda and sprinkle it on the mattress. Let it sit on the mattress for a few minutes. The baking soda will help to absorb any remaining liquid on the mattress and remove odor. After the baking soda has been on the mattress for a few minutes, vacuum it up. Use an all-purpose cleaner for fabric on the mattress. You can also make your own cleaner by combining one part warm water and one part white vinegar. Spray the cleaner on the mattress and let it sit for three to five minutes. Make sure you cover all of the wet areas on the mattress with the cleaner. You can apply several layers of the cleaner to the mattress if the smell is strong. Use a dry towel or cloth to blot the mattress once the cleaner has been absorbed. Blot the entire mattress well. This will prevent mold in the mattress and ensure the mattress is as dry as possible. Sprinkle the mattress one more time with the baking soda. Then, let the mattress air dry for at least 18 hours. This will ensure the mattress has time to completely dry. You may need to sleep somewhere else for the night if you were planning on sleeping on the mattress. Do not try to sleep on the mattress until it is completely dry. Once the mattress has time to dry, use a vacuum to clean up the baking soda. You can then put the mattress outside or in an area with good ventilation in your home. This will allow any remaining smell to fade away.  Touch the mattress to confirm it is dry before you use it again.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Gunmen Kill 68 in Kenya Mall Attack Gunmen opened fire at an upscale Nairobi mall Saturday, killing at least 68 and wounding 175. The city’s police chief Benson Kibue told the Associated Press that it was likely an act of terrorism, with no more than 10 attackers involved. After the gunmen burst into the Westgate mall, which is situated in an affluent neighborhood and popular among expatriates, they began to shoot indiscriminately and take hostages. The attackers did, however, assert that non-Muslims were being targeted. Witness Elijah Kamau told the AP that the gunmen, who were toting AK-47s and hand grenades, announced that Muslims were safe and should stand up and leave. Around 5 p.m. local time, the Kenyan Red Cross began reporting on Twitter that some hostages were being evacuated: #WestGateShooting more people being escorted out of the mall by @Abbas_Gullet. ^PE http://t.co/JqkvMXlQgB— Kenya Red Cross (@KenyaRedCross) September 21, 2013 Early Sunday morning, about 12 hours after the attack began, several gunmen remained inside the mall with an unknown number of hostages.

Berg city used only gas powered vehicles while Hill city used electrical vehicles. The two cities had a similar population and vehicle numbers.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which city had fewer problems with carbon monoxide?  Hint: Gasoline-powered vehicles emit a lot of harmful materials. Nitrogen oxides are formed when atmospheric nitrogen reacts with oxygen at the high temperatures found in a car engine. Carbon monoxide is a by-product of incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons. Evaporated and unused fuel releases volatile hydrocarbons into the atmosphere to help form smog. The presence of a catalytic converter in the exhaust system of the car causes these materials to react and be changed into less harmful products. A:","output":"Hill city had fewer problems with carbon monoxide. Justification: From the provided information, gasoline-powered vehicles, like those in Berg city, emit a lot of harmful substances including carbon monoxide, a byproduct of incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons. With the city fully dependent on such vehicles, it's logical to infer that the levels of carbon monoxide would be relatively high. On the contrary, Hill city uses electrical vehicles, which do not burn fossil fuels like gasoline, so they won't produce carbon monoxide emissions directly.

Answer the following question given this paragraph:   The diagrams above can serve as a pathway to understanding evolutionary history. The pathway can be traced from the origin of life to any individual species by navigating through the evolutionary branches between the two points. Also, by starting with a single species and tracing back towards the \\"trunk\\" of the tree, one can discover that species' ancestors, as well as where lineages share a common ancestry. In addition, the tree can be used to study entire groups of organisms. Another point to mention on phylogenetic tree structure is that rotation at branch points does not change the information. For example, if a branch point was rotated and the taxon order changed, this would not alter the information because the evolution of each taxon from the branch point was independent of the other. Many disciplines within the study of biology contribute to understanding how past and present life evolved over time; these disciplines together contribute to building, updating, and maintaining the “tree of life. ” Information is used to organize and classify organisms based on evolutionary relationships in a scientific field called systematics. Data may be collected from fossils, from studying the structure of body parts or molecules used by an organism, and by DNA analysis. By combining data from many sources, scientists can put together the phylogeny of an organism; since phylogenetic trees are hypotheses, they will continue to change as new types of life are discovered and new information is learned.   Q: Many disciplines within the study of biology contribute to understanding how past and present life evolved over time; these disciplines together contribute to building, updating, and maintaining this?

You can put it under your pillow and look forward to finding some money there in the morning. And then you can watch your new permanent  tooth grow in its place. But if a permanent tooth falls out, that's a problem. There isn't another one under the gum that can replace it. Unfortunately, this happens to some older people. And if permanent teeth fall out-or need to be pulled-an older person might need dentures. Dentures, known as false teeth, are a set of replacement teeth for any teeth that are missing. There are partial dentures, which take the place of only a few teeth and prevent the others from changing position. If all the teeth are gone, the person would need complete dentures, which replace every tooth in the mouth. Dentures can cause pains at first and take little time to get adjusted to. They also need special care. They should be brushed daily with a special denture brush and cleanser and soaked in denture solution when not in the mouth. Dentures are important for older folks because, without teeth, it's hard to smile, talk, and eat properly. But it can be a little  _ if you see someone take out his or her dentures. It can also be strange to see someone, like a grandparent, without dentures in because he or she won't have any teeth. Try not to make fun of the person because this could cause hurt feelings. People usually lose their permanent teeth due to periodontal disease, or gum disease, which is caused by bacteria that attacks the gums. Diseased gums aren't strong and healthy, so teeth can get loose and fall out. Older people often have many cavities that have been filled over the years, and these fillings can weaken over time, leading to more tooth decay. Question: A person wearing dentures_.

He said he nearly threw the bottle back into the water after pulling it out of a fishing net. Then he noticed something inside. The bottle in good condition contained a Danish postcard with two German stamps,dated May 17,1913.

While he was hiking on the Baltic coast with a nature appreciation group,he threw the bottle into the sea. Then the researchers began a search for any living relatives of his.

Speaking with reporters in the Oval Office, Trump said that he congratulated Putin -- a figure who has loomed over his administration because of Russia's meddling in the 2016 election -- on winning another term. The result of the election, however, was never in doubt, given Putin's autocratic stranglehold on power.

On February 5, 1994 at ECW's event, The Night the Line was Crossed, Awesome nearly injured wrestler, J.T. Smith when he performed a high-risk dive to the outside of the ring. Smith's back was folded backwards against the guard rail during the impact. This spot appeared in many ECW highlight reels including the intro to a variety of their television programs for years to come.

At Eynsford, with Moeran as his co-tenant, Heseltine presided over a bohemian household with a flexible population of artists, musicians and friends. Moeran had studied at the Royal College of Music before and after the First World War; he avidly collected folk music and had admired Delius during his youth. Although they had much in common, he and Heseltine rarely worked together, though they did co-write a song, \\"Maltworms\\". The other permanent Eynsford residents were Barbara Peache, Heseltine's long-term girlfriend whom he had known since the early 1920s, and Hal Collins, a New Zealand Māori who acted as a general factotum. Peache was described by Delius's assistant Eric Fenby as \\"a very quiet, attractive girl, quite different from Phil's usual types\\". Although not formally trained, Collins was a gifted graphic designer and occasional composer, who sometimes assisted Heseltine. The household was augmented at various times by the composers William Walton and Constant Lambert, the artist Nina Hamnett, and sundry acquaintances of both sexes.The ambience at Eynsford was one of alcohol (the \\"Five Bells\\" public house was conveniently across the road) and uninhibited sexual activity. These years are the primary basis for the Warlock legends of wild living and debauchery. Visitors to the house left accounts of orgies, all-night drunken parties, and rough horseplay that at least once brought police intervention. However, such activities were mainly confined to weekends; within this unconventional setting Heseltine accomplished much work, including settings from the Jacobean dramatist John Webster and the modern poet Hilaire Belloc, and the Capriol Suite in versions for string and full orchestra. Heseltine continued to transcribe early music, wrote articles and criticism, and finished the book on Gesualdo.

Her father made a great deal of money in trade. During school,her parents took her to Italy to explore the country's many cultural treasures. One of the private art collections Isabella visited in Milan had a deep influence on her. She wrote to her friends about her dream of owning a house one day with an art collection like the one she had seen in Italy. In Paris, Isabella became a close friend of one of her classmates, Julia Gardner, whose family was from Boston. Julia would later introduce Isabella to her brother, Jack. In 1860, Isabella Stewart married Jack Gardner. The couple had too much art to fit inside their home. So they decided to start planning a museum. Mrs. Gardner didn't like the cold and empty spaces of many museums during her time. She wanted a warm museum filled with light. She once said that she decided years ago that _ . America was a young country developing quickly in other areas. But the country needed more chances for people to see beautiful examples of art. After her husband's death in 1898, Isabella knew she had no time to lose in building her museum. She bought land, hired a building designer, and supervised  every detail of her museum's construction. Mrs. Gardner opened her museum on January 1,1903. The museum was then called Fenway Court. She invited her friends that night for a special musical performance. The next month, she opened the museum to the public. At first, visits were limited to twenty days out of the year. Visitors paid one dollar to enter. Isabella Stewart Gardner died in 1924 in Boston.

Context: The White House says China's proposal to abolish presidential term limits — a move that could make Xi Jinping president for life — is an internal matter for Beijing. \\"I believe that's a decision for China to make about what's best for their country,\\" press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said at a Monday press briefing. Term limits, Sanders said, are something Trump \\"supports here in the United States, but that's a decision that would be up to China.\\" The Chinese Communist Party proposed removing the presidential two-term limit from China's constitution, state media reported Sunday. The move would be a further consolidation of power for Xi, who is already seen as one of China's most powerful leaders in decades.  On Monday, U.S. President Donald Trump praised Xi, saying he has a \\"very good relationship\\" and \\"great respect\\" for the Chinese leader. \\"I think that President Xi is unique. He's helping us with North Korea,\\" Trump said during a White House meeting with U.S. governors. Trump has not specifically addressed the issue of China removing term limits. To some, Sanders' comments are the latest evidence of a break in the long-standing U.S. tradition of encouraging democracy in China, and reflect an unwillingness to criticize undemocratic regimes. \\"In effect, she is saying that the U.S. is OK with Xi Jinping simply asserting that he will remain in power indefinitely,\\" said Sophie Richardson, China director at Human Rights Watch. \\"Does she realize China isn't a democracy?\\" During the presidential campaign, Trump regularly slammed China and its trade policies. But since becoming president, Trump has toned down the criticism. Instead, Trump has prioritized working with China to address North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programs. However, several reports suggest the White House could soon announce trade decisions, such as tariffs on Chinese imports, that could strain the U.S.-China relationship.

At least once during the year, likely toward the beginning, I would center a lesson around self portraits. In younger classes, there would be more than one. Creating a self portrait teaches students to be aware of themselves. Where is her head in relation to her body? Where are her feet in relation to her legs? It also teaches children spatial awareness. Where should he begin…with his feet or with his head? Where on the paper should his head be placed? How far down should his arms go? How can his whole body fit on a single piece of paper? A Lesson on Creating Self Portraits Whether you are in a classroom, or teaching a child at home, here is a simple lesson on creating self portraits geared toward young children, anywhere from age 2 through age 6. Keep in mind that their final product will show various levels of writing development, depending on what stage of writing they are in. (Basically, a two-year-old’s drawing should look very different than that of a five-year-old.) The teacher will need to model how to draw a self portrait. Gather the children around an easel or board and clip a paper to it. Narrate the process as you walk through the steps. “I am going to draw a picture of myself. I am going to start with my head.” Use your hands to show your actual head on yourself so students are aware of what you talking about.

Here's why: In sentence 1, the speaker is addressing someone named Natalia, and they note, 'You haven't shot me yet, Natalia.' This is the speaker's way of pointing out that they have not been shot by Natalia. The phrase 'You haven't shot me yet' directly implies that the speaker has not been shot, and Natalia is the person who has not shot the speaker. In sentence 2, 'I pointed out that I had not been shot,' the speaker recounts the same information from the first sentence. This sentence, however, lacks the explicit mention of Natalia and the temporal marker 'yet.' Regardless, the underlying message stays the same: the speaker has not been shot.  Therefore, if the first sentence is true (the speaker has not been shot by Natalia), then the second sentence is also true (the speaker has not been shot). However, it's crucial to note that while the second sentence can confirm that the speaker was not shot, it does not provide information about who has not shot the speaker and does not include the potential future implication carried by 'yet.' Nonetheless, if the speaker has truly not been shot, as stated in sentence 1, then sentence 2 is unquestionably valid because it states the same central event — the speaker has not been shot."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Born on October 29, 1948, in Birmingham, Alabama, Catherine Elise Jackson, professionally known as Kate Jackson, began her acting career with roles in various television series such as 'Dark Shadows,' 'The Rookies,' and 'The Six Million Dollar Man.' However, it was her portrayal of 'Sabrina Duncan' in 'Charlie's Angels' that catapulted her to stardom. The show, created by Ivan Goff and Ben Roberts, premiered on September 22, 1976, and was an instant hit. Kate Jackson starred alongside Farrah Fawcett and Jaclyn Smith, who played Jill Munroe and Kelly Garrett, respectively. The trio portrayed detectives working for an unseen and elusive millionaire named Charles Townsend, voiced by John Forsythe. The show's premise revolved around the crime-solving adventures of these three private detectives, who were referred to as \\"Angels\\" by their boss, Charlie. As Sabrina Duncan, Kate Jackson was the smart and resourceful member of the team, often taking the lead in investigating cases. Her character, considered the most level-headed among the Angels, played a crucial role in the strategies and planning needed to crack the case. Jackson starred in the first three seasons of 'Charlie's Angels' before leaving the show in 1979. Actress Shelley Hack replaced her in the fourth season, playing a new character, Tiffany Welles. Although Kate Jackson's time on 'Charlie's Angels' was limited to just three seasons, her portrayal of Sabrina Duncan had a lasting impact. The character remains an integral part of the show's history and a symbol of female empowerment in the male-dominated television landscape. Following 'Charlie's Angels,' Jackson continued her acting career with roles in television shows like 'Scarecrow and Mrs. King,' 'Baby Boom,' and 'The Silence of the Hams.' She also directed episodes of TV series and acted in numerous TV movies, cementing her legacy as a versatile and talented actress in the entertainment industry."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

March 11, 2004, attacks killed 191 people and wounded 1,800. Explosives were left on the Spanish trains in sports bags and backpacks.","output":"Title: Remembering the Madrid Train Bombings: A Look Back at Spain's Deadliest Terrorist Attack Five Years On On March 11, 2021, Spain commemorated the fifth anniversary of the Madrid train bombings, an event that shook the nation and the world. The March 11, 2004 attacks, popularly known as 11-M, claimed the lives of 191 innocent people and left more than 1,800 others wounded. It remains one of the deadliest terrorist attacks in European history, deeply changing the course of Spanish society, politics, and security measures. The Madrid train bombings were a series of coordinated attacks, targeting commuter trains during the morning rush hour. The attackers left explosives hidden in sports bags and backpacks on four separate trains, ultimately causing devastation to three train stations: Atocha, El Pozo del Tío Raimundo, and Santa Eugenia. The attackers, believed to be an Al-Qaeda-inspired jihadist cell, chose the date of March 11 as a symbolic gesture. It marked 911 days after the September 11, 2001 attacks in the United States, signaling their ambition to inflict horror on a scale comparable to that experienced in New York City and Washington DC. As the news of the bombings spread, people across the globe were struck by the gruesome nature of the attack. It brought back memories of the 9/11 attacks, leading people to question the safety of public transportation systems and the reality that no place, no matter how ordinary or mundane, could be completely safe from terrorist threats. The aftermath of the bombings saw an outpouring of global support for Spain, as the bereaved struggled to come to terms with the loss of their loved ones. Spanish citizens, as well as those living in other countries, were united in grief and a determination to stand against terrorism. In Spain, a controversial decision by then-Prime Minister José María Aznar to attribute the attack to the Basque separatist group ETA, rather than radical Islamists, triggered mass protests and contributed to the electoral defeat of the ruling Partido Popular (PP) government. The truth eventually emerged about the attackers' jihadist motives, leading to sweeping changes in political and security policies both within Spain and throughout Europe. Over the past five years, Spain has taken significant steps to strengthen its counter-terrorism measures. Increased surveillance, intelligence-gathering efforts, and cooperation with other European countries have helped thwart numerous terrorist plots, making public transport and other potential targets more secure. However, as with any nation, the duty to protect citizens from terrorism remains an ongoing challenge. The Madrid train bombings of March 11, 2004, serve as a harrowing reminder of the indiscriminate nature of terrorism and the lengths to which extremist groups will go to further their twisted ideologies. As Spain marks the fifth anniversary of this horrific tragedy, it is important for us to remember the victims and honor their memories, while continuing to stand together against the forces of hatred and violence that aim to divide us. In commemorating the fifth anniversary of the Madrid train bombings, we not only remember the victims and their families but also recommit ourselves to the continued fight against terrorism. It has been a collaborative effort, not only within Spain but throughout Europe and the world. The sacrifices of those who lost their lives on March 11, 2004, will not be forgotten and serve as a reminder of the need for vigilance and unity in the face of hatred and violence."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Process:  - Place the water in a pot - Cover the pot with a slightly too large cover - Place a larger pot under the first - Heat water to evaporation - Water vapor will collect on the lid - Drip into the second pot as fresh water - Salt is left behind in the original pot.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the heat is lowered happens, how will it affect MORE salt being removed from the water.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"The proposed perturbation of lowering the heat source during the described evaporation process would not directly contribute to more salt being removed from the water. In fact, it could slow down the overall distillation process. The removal of salt from the water in this process is due to the principle of distillation, where water is converted into water vapor by heating and then recondensed as it cools, leaving behind the salt. The rate of this process is largely dependent on the amount of heat applied -- the higher the heat, the faster water will turn to vapor, and the faster the distillation process. If the heat is lowered, it will take longer for the water to reach its boiling point, slow down the evaporation process, and thus prolong the distillation process. It doesn't necessarily help in removing more salt. The salt left behind is simply because it doesn't evaporate with the water, not because of the heat level. Therefore, the perturbation of lowering the heat would have an indirect effect, mainly on the time efficiency of the process, but not on the quantity of salt being removed. To remove more salt, you would have to distill more of the saltwater rather than lowering the heat."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Write a summary based on this article: Donald Trump is going all out to persuade seven-term Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch to seek reelection — a push aimed in no small part at keeping the president’s longtime nemesis, Mitt Romney, out of the Senate.      Romney has been preparing to run for Hatch’s seat on the long-held assumption that the 83-year-old would retire. Yet Hatch, the longest-serving Republican senator in history, is now refusing to rule out another campaign — a circumstance Romney’s infuriated inner circle blames squarely on the president. Their suspicions are warranted: Trump has sounded off to friends about how he doesn't like the idea of a Sen. Romney.      Story Continued Below      The president’s mostly behind-the-scenes campaign to sway Hatch will burst into public view on Monday, when he arrives in Salt Lake City to hold a well-choreographed event designed to showcase his affection for the powerful Senate Finance Committee chairman.      Trump’s appearance is ostensibly official in purpose: He will announce his decision to reduce the size of Utah’s Bears Ears and Grand-Staircase Escalante national monuments, a cause that Hatch has championed. But it's also undeniably political: to use the trappings of presidential power to get a veteran lawmaker to rethink his long anticipated plans to leave the Senate.      Hatch is slated to ride with Trump both ways on Air Force One — a total of roughly nine hours round trip. After descending from the plane together, the two will meet with Mormon leaders and then head to the state Capitol for the signing of the executive order, according to three White House officials. Hatch will introduce Trump, who in turn is expected to lavish praise on the senator. After the order is signed, Hatch is expected to receive the president’s pen.      The public display of affection isn’t just about blocking Romney, senior administration officials say. Trump has felt loyal to Hatch since the senator defended him in the wake of the “Access Hollywood” tape episode late in the 2016 campaign. Hatch stuck by Trump even as other members of Utah’s Republican delegation withdrew their support.      Sign up here for POLITICO Huddle A daily play-by-play of congressional news in your inbox.

More recently, Hatch has played a key role in moving Trump's prized tax reform bill through the Senate.      Trump aides say the president's bond with Hatch began long before Romney emerged as a potential successor. Hatch visited Trump in the Oval Office during the first week of his presidency for a lengthy discussion about the then-vacant Supreme Court seat and Utah’s national monuments.      Yet people close to Romney are convinced that Trump’s main motivation is to keep the 2012 GOP presidential nominee out of the Senate. Romney himself has expressed frustration with the ongoing uncertainty about Hatch’s plans, said three Republicans who’ve spoken with him recently. The former Massachusetts governor has pointed out that it was Hatch who urged him to consider running in the first place, but now appears to be wavering on whether to step aside.      \\"Hatch is a known entity for Trump and has been really good for the president for the most part,\\" said Kirk Jowers, a friend of Romney who formerly served as the chairman and general counsel of his political action committee. \\"He knows for a fact he's not going to get that with Romney. I don't know that he knows what he's going to get with Romney, but it's not going to be what he's got with Hatch.\\"      Indeed, there’s widespread concern within the White House that Romney in the Senate could make Trump’s life difficult. During the 2016 campaign, the former Massachusetts governor emerged as the de-facto leader of the GOP establishment’s “Never Trump” campaign, delivering a nationally watched speech in which he blasted candidate Trump as a “phony, a fraud” and implored the party to stop him.      Hatch, by contrast, went all-in for Trump in Utah, where Trump received just 46 percent of the vote but still carried the state because of a third-party candidate. Before the election, the senator also campaigned for Trump in four states, hitting the trail with the candidate’s son Donald Trump Jr. While many Republicans air their issues with Trump publicly, Hatch has usually chosen to telegraph his concerns in private discussions with the president.      “I’ll just put it this way. Sen. Hatch was one of the leading voices for the president during the entire campaign,” said Don Peay, a Trump family friend who led his Utah campaign. “Hatch clearly was a strong supporter of Trump from the beginning,” said Peay, who helped to organize Monday’s event.      Trump’s push to get Hatch to run for an eighth term has taken place in furtive phone calls and West Wing visits. In early October, the senator called the president to invite him to Utah to announce his monument plan, said one person briefed on the discussion.      Near the end of the call, the president conveyed a request. “Orrin,” he said, “I really hope you will consider running again.”      Hatch told Trump he hadn't made up his mind.      Their mutual endearment has at times been public. When Hatch was asked last week by reporters about Trump’s decision to retweet several anti-Muslim videos, the senator said he wasn’t “aware” of the firestorm — and then praised Trump.      “I’ll say this for ya.’ He’s been one of the best presidents I’ve served under, and the reason is he’s not afraid to make decisions. He’s not afraid to take on the big boss around here,” Hatch said.      Trump responded by tweeting out a video of the remark. “Thank you @SenOrrinHatch,” he added. “Let’s continue MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!”      Romney’s post-election relationship with Trump has been far more ... complicated.      During the transition, Trump considered appointing Romney secretary of state. Trump was expecting not to like Romney but was surprised by how well they jelled during the interview process, something he told aides repeatedly at the time. Trump ultimately decided against Romney.      As the year wore on, the former governor praised the new president for some of his personnel choices. But he also made his differences known.      During an appearance in Park City, Utah, in June, Romney told a group of prominent Republican donors that Trump’s White House was too consumed by palace intrigue. He also offered an implicit critique of the president’s “America First” approach to foreign policy, growing emotional as he outlined the country’s humanitarian responsibilities overseas.      Then, in August, Romney struck again — this time to implore the president to apologize for equating white supremacists who sowed violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, with their counterprotesters.      “Mr. President,” Romney wrote in a Facebook message, “act now for the good of the country.”      Romney has been making the rounds in Utah amid speculation that Hatch is nearing retirement, huddling with an array of Republican figures including state House Speaker Greg Hughes. Romney has told people that while he wouldn’t be reflexively anti-Trump as a senator, he would be more than willing to let his criticisms be known.      Some Trump allies contend that Utah would be better served by having a presidential loyalist in the seat.      \\"I think he could be a great ally of the president but, as you well know, they're very different people and have very different personalities,\\" said Hughes, who recently met with Romney in his office in the state Capitol. \\"Sen. Hatch,” he added, “understands the president very well.\\"      Asked who the president would rather have in the seat, Hughes, who was once mentioned as a candidate for a position in the Trump administration, said he had little doubt: \\"I think the president enjoys having a strong ally.\\"      Romney, for his part, won’t be at Monday event. He was invited but, several people close to him said, will be out of town.      Over the weekend, Romney wrote a tweet that underscored his respect for Hatch but also, perhaps, hinted at a belief that the senator had now accomplished what he needed to before moving on.      “A very big week for Utah’s own Senator @OrrinHatch,” he wrote, “with tax reform, Bears Ears reversion, and a presidential visit.”       |||||       Washington • When Air Force One descends into Salt Lake City on Monday morning, planes departing and arriving will be held, causing momentary delays for travelers.      And President Donald Trump’s motorcade — mixed with pending snow showers — will likely cause some headaches for drivers in Utah’s capital city as he zips around to meet with Mormon church leaders and speak at the state Capitol.      Trump, visiting Utah to announce he’ll shrink Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante national monuments, will be brief — he’s spending less than three hours on the ground — but will consume the state’s focus for the day.      Monday marks Trump’s first visit to the state as president, though no public events are scheduled for residents to see him.      Trump arrives just before 11 a.m. Monday at the Utah Air National Guard Base attached to Salt Lake City International Airport. From there, he heads to Welfare Square to meet with officials from The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and where he’s expected to take a quick tour of the faith’s humanitarian efforts for the needy.      After that, Trump will appear at the Capitol to sign an executive order reportedly removing some 2 million acres from the national monuments created by his Democratic predecessors in southern Utah. Sen. Orrin Hatch and Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, who are traveling with the president from Washington, are expected to speak as well.      Trump departs Salt Lake City at 1:35 p.m.      The Capitol event is open only to invited guests, guaranteeing a friendly crowd excited about the reductions in the monument, as well as pre-credentialed m edia. A protest also is planned in the area.      The Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance told supporters in an email and Facebook post that it is planning a protest starting at 10:45 a.m. just across from the Capitol grounds along 300 North, calling Trump’s actions an “egregious assault on America’s public lands” that amounts to “the largest rollback of protected areas in U.S. history. It is also an appalling affront to Native American tribes who sought healing and cross-cultural understanding through protection of their sacred sites and ancestral homelands.”      The group cautioned, “This is a peaceful protest. We do not condone violence or destruction of property.”      Article continues below      Sportsmen for Fish and Wildlife, founded by Don Peay, one of Trump’s biggest Utah backers, took out a full-page ad in Utah’s metro newspapers Sunday to thank Trump for “hearing the voice of the Utah people, and for protecting our lands, wildlife and heritage of our public lands.”      As with any presidential visit, police are likely to shut down freeways and some roads as Trump and his motorcade move about Salt Lake City. The area around Welfare Square, just west of downtown, and the Capitol are likely to be secured as well. ||||| Summary:","output":"President Trump is actively trying to persuade seven-term Utah Senator Orrin Hatch to seek re-election, a move aimed at blocking Mitt Romney, a vocal critic of Trump, from attempting to gain a Senate seat.

Movie plot title: Dracula Movie plot: In May 1885, Jonathan Harker arrives at the castle of Count Dracula near Klausenburg (Cluj), to take up his post as librarian. Inside, he is startled by a young woman who claims she is a prisoner and begs for his help. Dracula then appears to greet Harker and guide him to his room, where he locks him in. Jonathan starts to write in his diary, and his true intentions are revealed: he is a vampire hunter and has come to kill Dracula.     John Van Eyssen as Jonathan Harker. Freed sometime later, Harker again is confronted by the desperate woman. She begs him for help but then bites his neck. Just as she does, Dracula â fangs bared and lips bloody â arrives and pulls her away. When he awakens in daylight, Harker finds the bite mark. He hides his journal in a shrine to the Virgin Mary outside the castle and descends into the crypt, where he finds Dracula and the vampire woman resting in their coffins. Armed with a stake, he impales the woman, who, as he looks on, immediately ages from young to old. Whilst he does this, the sun sets, and when he turns to Dracula's coffin with the intention of killing the vampire, he finds it empty. Looking up, Harker is in time to see the Count shut the door and they are both plunged into darkness... A few days have passed Dr. Van Helsing then arrives in Klausenburg, looking for Harker. An inn keeper's daughter gives him Harker's journal. When he arrives at the castle, it is deserted; a hearse carriage speeds by with a coffin in it. In the crypt, Van Helsing is horrified to discover Harker lying in a coffin as a vampire. Staking Harker, he leaves to deliver the veiled news of Harker's death in person to a wary Arthur Holmwood and his wife Mina, brother and sister-in-law of Harker's fiancÃ©e Lucy Holmwood. Lucy is ill, so the news is kept from her and Lucy's little niece, Tania.

Process:  - You inhale - The air enters the mouth and nose - The diaphragm contracts - Air fills all the sacks in the lungs - Oxygen passes through the sacks into capillaries - The blood is passed to the blood in the capillaries - The blood carries the oxygen to the heart - The heart pumps the oxygenated blood to the body.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose Every breath I exhale carbon dioxide happens, how will it affect greater lung capacity.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer to this question is:","output":"Yes, the perturbation hypothesis that suggests \\"every breath I exhale, carbon dioxide happens\\" does have an effect, both directly and indirectly, on the process of respiration and lung capacity. To understand the effects, let's first examine the normal process of respiration in more detail. Inhaling and exhaling are essential components of the respiratory system for exchanging oxygen (O2) and carbon dioxide (CO2) between the body and the environment. As you breathe in, air is drawn into the lungs, which causes the expansion of the chest cavity. The diaphragm, a muscular sheet located below the lungs, contracts and flattens to create a vacuum, and air is drawn into the lungs. This process allows oxygen-rich air to enter the alveoli, tiny air sacs found in the lungs. The oxygen diffuses through the alveoli walls and into the surrounding capillaries, where it binds to hemoglobin in red blood cells. At the same time, carbon dioxide, a waste product produced by cells during cellular respiration, is transported from cells to the alveoli via the bloodstream. The carbon dioxide then diffuses back into the alveoli and is finally exhaled as a waste product. The perturbation hypothesis suggests that a higher amount of carbon dioxide is exhaled with every breath. This could arise from factors such as increased metabolic activity, physical exertion, or underlying medical conditions. This increase in carbon dioxide exhalation would have direct and indirect effects on the respiratory process and lung capacity. Direct effects: 1. Increase in the breathing rate: The body maintains an optimal balance of oxygen and carbon dioxide levels in the blood. An increase in carbon dioxide production would trigger the body to adjust its breathing rate, resulting in more rapid and deeper breaths, so as to remove the excess waste product effectively. This increased breathing rate could enhance the lung capacity, as the lungs need to work more efficiently to expel the carbon dioxide. 2. Increased demand on the alveoli: With an increase in carbon dioxide production, the alveoli will need to work harder to maintain proper gas exchange, which could encourage the expansion of lung tissue and greater lung capacity over time. Indirect effects: 1. Response to aerobic exercise: Aerobic exercises like running, cycling, or swimming require the body to produce more energy, which results in the production of higher amounts of carbon dioxide. As a result, the respiratory system needs to adjust its efficiency to accommodate these changes. Regular aerobic exercise can lead to an increase in lung capacity, as they train the respiratory muscles, like the diaphragm, to be stronger and more efficient. 2. Impact on the cardiovascular system: An increased production of carbon dioxide can cause the heart to pump harder, as it needs to ensure that the oxygen-rich blood is delivered to all parts of the body while also removing the carbon dioxide from the bloodstream. Over time, this increased demand on the heart could contribute to an improvement in cardiovascular fitness and lung capacity. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis of increased carbon dioxide exhalation does have both direct and indirect effects on the respiratory process and lung capacity. Increased carbon dioxide production could lead to an enhancement in lung capacity by demanding higher efficiency from the respiratory and cardiovascular systems. Regular aerobic exercise and maintaining optimal lung health contribute significantly to improving overall lung capacity and function."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Perhaps the UNO could set up a body of devoted men and women in every country who can speedily distribute aid to victims of floods and earthquakes. More than the help that one nation can give to another during a disaster; it would be more effective to give other forms of help during normal times.

[Other reviews of Payton Curry's chef-in-residence at Welcome Diner: http://www.yelp.com/biz/payton-curry-at-welcome-diner-phoenix]  THE VEGETARIAN ANGLE  When you can date a review to the exact day (and with good reason), you know that you're in a special place.  We ate at Payton Curry's pop-up restaurant at the Welcome Diner last night, April 19, 2011, and the following is what we ate, but you may have a different menu on Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday evenings from 5pm-close through July 4.  Chef, I hear, tries to keep it real and keep it local and fresh when sourcing his menu, so it changes each week.  McClendon's Select was mentioned more than once.  (PRICE NOTE:  On Tuesdays from 10pm-close, the menu is 1/2 price to be sure Curry exhausts his fresh produce and meats.)  Welcome Diner was serving about 12 people when we arrived, 6 at the inside counter and three couples outside dotting the front yard, set up with a picnic table, a sawhorse, some two tops, and glass tabletop lanterns.  The food came out quickly, and our gracious and knowledgeable server asked if we'd like our dishes as they were prepared or in courses. We opted for the former.  My darling dining partner and I shared all four dishes.  THOSE DAMN GREEN BEANS We started with green beans, as crisp as they were picked, with just one tip snapped off, just like my grandmother taught me.  These were served with a citrus creme fraiche and some recently picked tarragon.  I always love dairy with tarragon, and this dish, served cool (not cold) if I remember, was dusted with local bee pollen, granular bits that taste of honey and something else and melt on your tongue.  MOZZARELLA The menu insists there's basil in this tangential rendition of caprese -- and there probably is -- but the takeaway message from this panko-encrusted slab of mozzarella with the sweetest tomatoes I've eaten is a sweet-n-sour burst with every olive oily bite.  A standout appetizer.  GNOCCHI If you're like me, when you've eaten or prepared gnocchi before, you assume they get plopped into the boiling salted water before the plump up and rise to the surface.  Not so fast, Barilla Boy.  Payton Curry's gnocchi, I believe, are (dry?) pan-seared on both sides,   keeping all the doughy, gummy deliciousness often lost in the water.  The madeira wine and cream reduction here smothers the pillowy gnocchi and tooth-tender walnuts and squiggly good morel mushrooms in a way that makes you close your eyes, shut off your hearing, and attempt to pour all of your sensory energy into taste and smell.  When eating this dish, I more than once covered my face with my hand to shield what may have been unflattering facial pangs of ecstasy.    LEMON CURD We struggled to choose this dessert over the Strawberry Olive Oil Cake and Strawberry Malt, but we got our strawberry fix as the second layer in this delectable parfait, topped with the airiest foamy meringue, and served in a mason jar.  The macerated strawberries made you want to relive childhood and replace mom's jelly with Payton's strawberries to accompany Laura Scudder in your PB&J sandwich.  We clanged spoons at the bottom of the jar for the last bit of bee pollen.  62 with tax and tip.  We didn't bring a BYOB wine but would next time.  (The 13 corkage fee seems high, but there ought to be an explanation for that.)  Everyone working in the tiny dinette and serving the tables outside had huge smiles and loads of enthusiasm for what they were contributing to the Garfield neighborhood and to the downtown culinary scene.  Others are taking notice, too. Michelle Laudig (former restaurant critic at Phoenix New Times) and Aaron Chamberlin of St. Francis both dropped in during our dinner.  I worry about the AZ heat baking the charm out of patio dining in May,  June, and July for Chef Curry, but I hope to return in April...maybe on a Tuesday at 10pm for half-price eats.

Most of the information about Pythagoras was written down centuries after he lived, so very little reliable information is known about him. He was born on the island of Samos, and travelled, visiting Egypt and Greece, and maybe India. Around 530 BC, he moved to Croton, in Magna Graecia, and there established some kind of school or guild. In 520 BC, he returned to Samos.  - It is a major competitor of the St college in Tokyo known as Komazawa University. Despite the university's sectarian affiliation, the school accepts Soto students.

Late Middle Japanese (11851600) saw changes in features that brought it closer to the modern language, as well as the first appearance of European loanwords. The standard dialect moved from the Kansai region to the Edo (modern Tokyo) region in the Early Modern Japanese period (early 17th centurymid-19th century). Following the end in 1853 of Japan's self-imposed isolation, the flow of loanwords from European languages increased significantly.

Answer choices: - Solar energy  - sunlight  - Heat energy  - rain or sun shine  - flow of electrons  - rays or beams  - Energy.  - seasons change A:","output":"A stronger sun can be experienced as the season changes due to the position of the Earth relative to the sun as well as changes in sunlight intensity during different times of the year. Based on the given answer choices: - Solar energy: Solar energy itself doesn't bring a stronger sun, but a stronger sun can generate increased solar energy. - Sunlight: The intensity of sunlight can vary during the seasons, which could bring a stronger sun in terms of brightness and warmth. - Heat energy: A stronger sun can produce more heat energy, making the environment warmer. - Rain or sun shine: These are weather conditions and do not directly bring a stronger sun, but sunlight can be more intense during clear days as compared to cloudy or rainy ones. - Flow of electrons: This is unrelated to a stronger sun, as the flow of electrons is a component of electrical processes. - Rays or beams: This refers to the sun's rays, which transmit heat and light energy. More intense rays or beams can contribute to a stronger sun. - Energy: A stronger sun emits more energy in the form of light and heat, but energy itself doesn't bring a stronger sun. - Seasons change: As the seasons change, Earth's tilt and position relative to the sun can cause variations in sunlight intensity, which in turn can result in a stronger sun during some seasons. In summary, the most direct answer to what can bring a stronger sun is the change in seasons, which can lead to increased sunlight and heat energy as the Earth's position relative to the sun varies.

Question: Title: The Never Ending Story ...Pt XXXVII Review: Written partly through the eyes of Helen herself (I assume ?), this story takes the reader on a ride through life, living in Melbourne Australia during the 1970's. It presents the life of a girl and her infatuation with a drug induced loser. Throughout the entire book, I found myself just waiting for her to come to her senses, and get her life back on track. Unfortunately .. as is life I guess, she never does and the book just ends, like it began with no real conclusions. It left me personally with a feeling of utter frustration. Is the review positive or negative? Answer:","output":"The review appears to be more negative than positive. The reviewer seems disenchanted with the main character's lack of growth or development, her poor life choices, and the lack of closure or resolution at the end of the book. Though the reviewer engages with the narrative - being drawn into the life of the protagonist and waiting for her to change - the overall dissatisfaction with the character's life decisions and the narrative structure suggests a negative response. The reviewer's feeling of 'utter frustration' at the end further supports this interpretation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Step 2: Determine if the 'no' is a valid option: In this context, using 'no' doesn't provide meaningful information since the sentence is talking about an age range. Step 3: Find a suitable number between zero and ten: To determine the correct number, we must consider that mares give birth to their first foal when they are between a lower age limit and six years old. Step 4: Analyzing the context: Since the lower age limit can't be equal to or greater than six (the upper limit), the missing number must be lower than six. Step 5: Choose a reasonable lower limit: Given that the mare is a female horse, and considering its gestation period (approximately 11 months), and the time it takes for a mare to reach sexual maturity (typically around 18 to 24 months), the earliest age for giving birth to their first foal would be around the age of two.

Apple iPad: excited British fans embrace new gadget after launch Long queues had formed outside the store for patient fans eager to lay claim to one of the first touch-screen table-style computers in Britain. Stores across the country opened an hour earlier to help cope with demand for the product which allows users to send emails, read novels, draw pictures and play games. The 9.7-inch touch-screen, which retails in Britain for between £429 and £699, has been hailed by the publishing industry as a potential life-saver. The iPad’s first wave of reviews praised its ability to deliver digital books and video quickly, saying it measured up well against other devices, including Amazon.com Inc.’s Kindle e-book reader. The first customer through the door at 8am was Jake Lee, 17, from Epping, Essex, who had camped outside the store for more than 20 hours with best friends Joe Woodcock, 17, and John Mansdorp, also from Essex. While braving the cold, the trio were given food and drinks by sympathetic Apple staff with several other customers offering them hundreds of pounds to replace them in line. As Jake ran into the store, after a countdown, he was greeted by screams and cheers from dozens of excited staff members who hugged and high-fived him before posing for the world’s media. The exhausted but “elated” performing arts student was then led up to the second floor under arch of hands, while quipping “let’s hope my card works”. “This is just amazing,” he told The Daily Telegraph just moments after he had bought the 64GB iPad with the help of some extra money from his father. “It is exactly what I thought it would be. This is just fantastic. It is unreal. I can't explain it, it is just ridiculously amazing. I just want to have a go on it now. “I have not slept for ages but I still have to go to college.\\" To applause from staff and clutching his new possession, which was later disclosed was bought with cash, he added: \\"I just want to play with this. It is so cool. It was so worth lining up.” He was still going to synchronise hundreds of his iPad music apps on his new purchase. Others in the line could not contain their excitement at their new purchase. Ian Harper, 41, from Northampton, queued for 16 hours and was the first customer to leave the store with the new iPad. \\"I feel fantastic,” the bank clerk said. “I'm looking forward to playing games now. I was one of the first people and that feels great. But I'm tired now.” Andy Parkinson, a communications engineer, 51, who bought his iPad in London said: \\"I’m going to use it for the Internet, e-mail, video, and controlling the other Macs at home. I think it is a big hit here. It already looks very good.” East London school student Mitchell Marks, 14, was able to get his new iPad after his mother, Tracy Rahilly, 42, lined up outside the store overnight. “This is just amazing. It is just the best,” he said. His mother said she had never seen her son so happy. “This is just fantastic,” she said. “I have not slept all night but this has been definitely worth it.” Edward Cook, 25, from Greenwich, south east London, said he was \\"thrilled\\" to have purchased his gadgets after a 10-hour wait. \\"I'm very excited but also quite tired. I've been here since 2am,” he said. \\"For me it (the iPad) is a novelty toy. The novelty may wear off but for now it is quite exciting.\\" Stephen Fry, the comedian, had his new iPad delivered but he attended the launch. “I just like the sensuality of the product, it is just such a nice thing to use,” he told reporters. “This is quite something isn’t it?” While not a “paid spokesman” he said he was a huge fan of the company and likened Steve Jobs, the chief executive, to Jack Warner, the famed boss of Warner Bros. In Birmingham, around 200 people lined up outside the Bull Ring's Apple Store for their doors to open at 8am. \\"I cannot wait to get my hands on it,\\" said first in the queue Adam Bullas, 24. Gadget fans who queued all night outside Belfast's Apple store said it was a great experience. Lisa McCormick, 27, from Lisburn on the outskirts of Belfast, said: \\"A black curtain was put up in front of the store so we could not see in, but at around 7am we got free coffee sent round from Starbucks, before the curtain fell. \\"Everyone cheered and we were all 'high-fived' as we walked in. It was great craic.\\" Apple was forced to push back its original late April UK launch date because of \\"overwhelming demand\\" for the iPad in the US. The company's website is already warning that iPad pre-orders made now will not ship until June 7. Apple sold more than one million iPads in the US since it was launched in April, making it a faster seller than the iPhone. The iPad was first announced in the United States in January. British sales figures for Friday's launch were unavailable, an Apple spokeswoman said. The British launch also came as the iPad went on sale in eight other countries on Friday — Australia, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Spain, Switzerland - with tens of thousands lining up from the early hours, with some waiting up to 40 hours to purchase. Alejandro Barras, manager of the Apple store in downtown Madrid, said the iPad sold out one hour after opening. Earlier this week, The California-based company’s market value hit more than 222bn (£152.5bn), edging it ahead of Microsoft, which has a market capitalisation of 219bn (£150.5 bn). Apple is now the second most valued company, behind the world’s largest, ExxonMobil. The oil giant is worth 282bn (£193.8bn). A string of suicides at a Chinese factory that churns out iPads and other high-tech items did not dampen the British launch after concerns were raised about conditions for workers who faced tremendous time pressures and harsh discipline for mistakes. In response, Apple issued a statement expressing commitment to ensuring that conditions \\"throughout our supply chain are safe and workers are treated with respect and dignity\\".

The neighbouring countries are Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and East Timor to the north; the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu to the north-east; and New Zealand to the south-east. Australia's capital is Canberra, and its largest urban area is Sydney.  - Wellington is the capital city and second most populous urban area of New Zealand, with residents. It is at the south-western tip of the North Island, between Cook Strait and the Rimutaka Range. Wellington is the major population centre of the southern North Island and is the administrative centre of the Wellington Region, which also includes the Kapiti Coast and Wairarapa. As the nation's capital city, the New Zealand Government and Parliament, Supreme Court and most of the civil service are based in the city.  - Fiji ((), officially the Republic of Fiji, is an island country in Melanesia in the South Pacific Ocean about northeast of New Zealand's North Island. Its closest neighbours are Vanuatu to the west, New Caledonia to the southwest, New Zealand's Kermadec Islands to the southeast, Tonga to the east, the Samoas and France's Wallis and Futuna to the northeast, and Tuvalu to the north.  - Cook Strait lies between the North and South Islands of New Zealand. It connects the Tasman Sea on the northwest with the South Pacific Ocean on the southeast, and runs next to the capital city, Wellington. It is wide at its narrowest point, and is considered one of the most dangerous and unpredictable waters in the world.  - Auckland is a city in the North Island of New Zealand. It is the most populous urban area in the country. Auckland has a population of , which constitutes percent of New Zealand's population. It is part of the wider Auckland Regionthe area governed by the Auckland Councilwhich also includes outlying rural areas and the islands of the Hauraki Gulf, resulting in a total population of . Auckland also has the largest Polynesian population of any city in the world. The Mori language name for Auckland is or , meaning \\"Tmaki with a hundred lovers\\", in reference to the desirability of its fertile land at the hub of waterways in all directions. It has also been called karana, the Mori enunciation of \\"Auckland\\".  - The Kaweka Range ( also known as the Kaweka Ranges ) of mountains is located in inland Hawke 's Bay in the eastern North Island of New Zealand . It forms part of the mountainous spine of the North Island which runs from Wellington to East Cape , including the Tararua and Ruahine ranges . The range lies between the city of Napier , 55 kilometres ( 34 mi ) to the southeast , and Lake Taupo , 50 kilometres ( 31 mi ) to the northwest . It is the source of many rivers which flow into Hawke Bay , including among them the Tutaekuri , Mohaka , and Ngaruroro Rivers . The highest point in the range is Kaweka J ( 1,724 metres ( 5,656 ft ) ) . The bush line varies from 1000 m to 1300 m. A tramping track follows the ridge line of the entire range . The Kaweka challenge is a running race held annually in the range since 1990 .  - Tectonic uplift is the portion of the total geologic uplift of the mean Earth surface that is not attributable to an isostatic response to unloading. While isostatic response is important, an increase in the mean elevation of a region can only occur in response to tectonic processes of crustal thickening (such as mountain building events), changes in the density distribution of the crust and underlying mantle, and flexural support due to the bending of rigid lithosphere.  - New Zealand is an island nation in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. The country geographically comprises two main landmassesthat of the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Mui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamuand numerous smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland.  - The Pacific Ocean is the largest of the Earth's oceanic divisions. It extends from the Arctic Ocean in the north to the Southern Ocean (or, depending on definition, to Antarctica) in the south and is bounded by Asia and Australia in the west and the Americas in the east.  - The South Island or Te Waipounamu (\\"Mori\\") is the larger of the two major islands of New Zealand, the other being the smaller but more populous North Island. It is bordered to the north by Cook Strait, to the west by the Tasman Sea, and to the south and east by the Pacific Ocean. The South Island covers and is influenced by a temperate climate.  - New Caledonia is a special collectivity of France located in the southwest Pacific Ocean, east of Australia and east of Metropolitan France. The archipelago, part of the Melanesia subregion, includes the main island of Grande Terre, the Loyalty Islands, the Chesterfield Islands, the Belep archipelago, the Isle of Pines, and a few remote islets. The Chesterfield Islands are in the Coral Sea. Locals refer to Grande Terre as \\"\\" (\\"the pebble\\").  - The North Island or Te Ika-a-Mui (\\"Mori\\") is one of the two main islands of New Zealand, separated from the slightly larger but much less populous South Island by Cook Strait.

Tanya was more blunt.","output":"Ending a relationship was easy for Jessica but not Tanya because Jessica was more blunt. There seem to be significant emotional variances and personality differences between Jessica and Tanya, particularly when it comes to dealing with relationships and their terminations.  Jessica, being the more blunt one, tends to be straightforward, candid, and usually unreserved about expressing her feelings and thoughts. This disposition enables her to maintain easier communication in all aspects of her life, including her relationships. When she deems that a relationship is no longer sustainable or healthy for her, she can directly address the issue and voice out her feelings. She doesn’t shy away from potentially uncomfortable conversations and can be upfront about her need to end the relationship. Her lack of fear regarding conflict or confrontation empowers her to make difficult but necessary decisions with relative ease. She tends not to prolong situations that make her unhappy, and this straightforwardness makes it easier for her to sever ties when she feels it's necessary.  On the other hand, Tanya, who lacks Jessica’s blunt approach, might encounter heightened difficulties when confronting a similar situation. Her nature might prevent her from expressing her dissatisfaction candidly or from being straightforward about her desire to leave the relationship. It can be challenging for Tanya to end relationships due to fear of confrontation, hurting the other person's feelings, or dealing with potential backlash. Tanya might also struggle with the guilt of disappointment and hurt she might cause the other person. She might linger in unhealthy or unhappy relationships longer, because of her difficulty in expressing her authentic emotions.  Tanya's approach to relationships may be considered more sensitive or empathetic by some, as it considers deeply the feelings of the other person. However, it is worth remembering that while being mindful of others' feelings is generally positive, it can become detrimental if it inhibits a person from doing what's best for their own well-being. In this contrast, we can understand why ending a relationship is easier for Jessica, with her blunt nature, and not so for Tanya. Nonetheless, it is crucial to remember that whether a person is direct like Jessica or more considerate like Tanya, no approach is inherently superior. It highly depends on the specific circumstances and how each approach is employed. Both can learn and grow from their respective traits. Jessica can benefit from exercising more empathy in her interactions, while Tanya can focus on becoming more assertive and prioritizing her personal needs when necessary."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The comments made at a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing reflected growing frustration in Congress about the U.S.-led war, which is entering its 17th year. ​As recently as November, General John Nicholson, the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan, acknowledged that the conflict remained a stalemate. Since then, a wave of high-profile insurgent attacks have rocked the capital, Kabul. The Taliban now controls or contests almost half the country, according to latest U.S. estimates. Despite the setbacks, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan, who is helping oversee the new White House strategy, gave a positive assessment of the conflict. \\"The president's South Asia strategy is showing some signs of progress,\\" Sullivan said. \\"On the battlefield, we are seeing the Taliban's momentum begin to slow.\\" But lawmakers from both parties expressed skepticism. \\"Something is clearly not working,\\" said Senator Ben Cardin, a Maryland Democrat and longtime Afghan war critic. \\"By any standard, the current security situation is grim.\\" Some lawmakers took aim at President Donald Trump, who last week said he didn't want to talk with the Taliban — a statement that seemingly contradicted his own strategy.

Now some countries use 50 kilograms of paper for each person in a year. But countries like America, England and Sweden certainly use more paper than other countries. Paper was first made in China about 2000 years ago. It was made from the hair-like parts of certain plants. Paper was not made in southern Europe until about the year 1100. In 1500, a German named Schaeffer found out that one could make the best paper from trees. After that the forest countries of Canada, Sweden, America, Finland became the most important ones in paper making. When we think of paper, we think of newspapers, books and writing paper.

In addition to a spoken standard and a closely related written standard, Czech has several regional dialects primarily used in rural areas by speakers less proficient in other dialects or standard Czech.

Formed from land donated by the states of Maryland and Virginia, the initial shape of the federal district was a square measuring 10 miles (16 km) on each side, totaling 100 square miles (259 km2).Two pre-existing settlements were included in the territory: the port of Georgetown, Maryland, founded in 1751, and the city of Alexandria, Virginia, founded in 1749. During 1791–92, Andrew Ellicott and several assistants, including a free African American astronomer named Benjamin Banneker, surveyed the borders of the federal district and placed boundary stones at every mile point. Many of the stones are still standing.A new federal city was then constructed on the north bank of the Potomac, to the east of Georgetown. On September 9, 1791, the three commissioners overseeing the capital's construction named the city in honor of President Washington. The federal district was named Columbia (a feminine form of \\"Columbus\\"), which was a poetic name for the United States commonly in use at that time. Congress held its first session in Washington on November 17, 1800.Congress passed the District of Columbia Organic Act of 1801 that officially organized the District and placed the entire territory under the exclusive control of the federal government. Further, the unincorporated area within the District was organized into two counties: the County of Washington to the east of the Potomac and the County of Alexandria to the west. After the passage of this Act, citizens living in the District were no longer considered residents of Maryland or Virginia, which therefore ended their representation in Congress.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. I have a new situation: Bob is a biologist. Today, he has four samples of organisms to test, sample A, sample B, sample C, and sample D. He induced higher respiration rate in sample A. Then he induced no respiration rate in sample B. Next, he classified sample C as heterotrophic and sample D as autotrophic.  But I can use this background: There must be more to this story than just gas exchange with the environment. To begin to appreciate the role of oxygen inside your body, think about when your breathing rate increases: climbing a steep slope, running a race, or skating a shift in a hockey game. Respiration rate correlates with energy use, and that correlation reflects the link between oxygen and energy metabolism. For this reason, the chemical process inside your cells that consume oxygen to produce usable energy is known as cellular respiration . During this process, energy is converted from glucose , in the presence of oxygen, into numerous ATP molecules. The glucose, of course, comes from the food you eat. In biological terms, you do not eat because you are hungry, you eat to get energy. Other heterotrophic organisms also acquire glucose from other organisms, whereas autotrophic organisms make their own glucose, mostly through photosynthesis.  What is an answer for this question: Would sample D make their own glucose or acquire it from other organisms?","output":"Based on the given information, sample D is classified as autotrophic. Autotrophic organisms are capable of synthesizing their own glucose, primarily through the process of photosynthesis. In photosynthesis, autotrophs convert light energy into chemical energy, which is stored in the form of glucose, using carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O) as raw materials. Therefore, sample D, as an autotrophic organism, would make its own glucose rather than acquire it from other organisms. This is in contrast to heterotrophic organisms, like sample C, which obtain glucose from consuming other organisms, as they lack the ability to produce their own glucose. Autotrophic organisms, such as plants, algae, and certain bacteria, act as primary producers in ecosystems, converting sunlight into energy and providing a source of glucose and nutrients for heterotrophic organisms, which include animals, fungi, and certain bacteria. It is important to note that oxygen plays a crucial role in the process of cellular respiration for both autotrophs and heterotrophs. In cellular respiration, organisms consume oxygen and glucose to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP), water, and carbon dioxide. ATP serves as the primary energy currency for cells, powering various cellular processes. In summary, sample D, as an autotrophic organism, would make its own glucose through processes such as photosynthesis; it would not obtain glucose from other organisms. This distinguishes it from heterotrophic organisms, like sample C, which rely on consuming other organisms for their glucose and energy needs."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Why didn't they meet that evening?   - They were both busy doing their own work.  - They waited for each other at different places.  - They went to the street corner at different times.","output":"To complete this task, I will first analyze the dialogue between W and M and find the crucial information related to the question. 1. W asks George where he was yesterday evening, as they were supposed to meet at the concert. 2. M (George) responds that he waited for W at the corner of W's street and then looked for W at their flat, but the housekeeper said W was out. Now I will consider the given answer options and justify which one matches the situation based on the dialogue: A) They were both busy doing their own work. - This doesn't seem to be the explanation since they both expressed their intention to meet each other. B) They waited for each other at different places. - This seems to be the correct answer because, according to the dialogue, W was at the concert and expected to see George there, while M (George) was waiting at the corner of W's street. C) They went to the street corner at different times. - This could be a possible but incomplete explanation because there is no clear information about the time they were at the street corner.

Movie plot title: School Ties Movie plot: David Greene (Fraser) is a working-class Jewish teenager from Scranton, Pennsylvania during the 1950s, who is given an unusual football scholarship to become the school's starting quarterback at an exclusive Massachusetts protestant prep school, St. Matthew's, or St. Matt's.In this film about coming of age and prejudice, Greene's Jewish heritage is first insulted in a hometown bar and it is after this that his father tells him that he \\"can't fight his way through life like this\\" even if his Jewish background is insulted; this is his big chance to go to Harvard.Greene is exposed to prejudice from his first day at his new school. His new football coach, Coach McDevitt, drives him onto the campus. His coach, awkwardly asks about any special \\"dietary\\" needs David might have, presumably because of his Jewish background and stresses to not to tell the other boys any more about himself than he has to. When he meets the \\"other big men on campus\\" --Dillon, Connors, Van Kelt, Reece-- he becomes aware of their feelings towards Jews in a conversation about team follower McGivern's new hi-fi he \\"Jewed down\\" from forty to thirty dollars.Greene finds his faith tested when he attends Protestant chapel and when he must choose between going to temple for Rosh Hashanah as his father wishes and playing football. He copes with this second challenge by playing the game where he establishes himself as the team's leader and throws a long touchdown pass late in the 4th quarter to give St. Matt's a 13-7 win in the game, and later that night reciting Jewish prayers in the chapel in honor of Rosh Hashanah.Beyond dealing with religious prejudice this film deals with social prejudices, abuse of power, and the concept of honor. Fairly early on in the film, it becomes clear that although they are gifted by the circumstances of birth, not all of Greene's classmates are gifted academically.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. I have a new situation: Jennifer is currently looking for a new city to move to since she is looking to change her life and just do something different. Jennifer is a strong environmentalist and doesn't want to move to a city that contributes a lot to climate change since she feels it's every person's duty to take care of the Earth. She looks online and finds out about two cities in Minnesota that are several hundred miles apart. Jamestown has a very famous water park and uses coal to generate the city's electricity. Dapperton, the other city she is considering, has a neat hobby shop that Jennifer likes and the city uses nuclear power for its electricity needs.  But I can use this background: In the U.S., the majority of electricity is produced by burning coal or other fossil fuels. This causes air pollution, acid rain, and global warming. Fossil fuels are also limited and may eventually run out. Like fossil fuels, radioactive elements are limited. In fact, they are relatively rare, so they could run out sooner rather than later. On the other hand, nuclear fission does not release air pollution or cause the other environmental problems associated with burning fossil fuels. This is the major advantage of using nuclear fission as a source of energy.  What is an answer for this question: Given Jennifer's stance on the environment, which city shouldn't she move to?","output":"Given Jennifer's strong commitment to environmentalism and her desire to live in a city that does not contribute significantly to climate change, it would be more appropriate for her to avoid moving to Jamestown. There are several reasons why Jennifer should consider Dapperton instead. Firstly, as mentioned in the background information, the majority of electricity in the U.S. is produced by burning coal or other fossil fuels, which leads to air pollution, acid rain, and global warming. Jamestown, having a coal-fired power plant, would contribute to these environmental issues, thereby conflicting with Jennifer's values. As a strong environmentalist, she should avoid supporting a city that relies heavily on such unsustainable and polluting energy sources. On the other hand, Dapperton uses nuclear power as its primary source of electricity. Although nuclear fission produces nuclear waste, it does not release air pollution or cause the environmental problems associated with burning fossil fuels. It can be considered a cleaner energy source when compared to coal, making it a more suitable option for someone with Jennifer's concerns. Furthermore, the fact that nuclear fission generates a significant amount of power using relatively small amounts of fuel makes it an efficient energy choice, despite the finite supply of radioactive elements. In addition to the environmental aspects, Dapperton also has an appealing local attraction that Jennifer likes: a hobby shop. This can contribute to her overall happiness and satisfaction with the city, providing her with an additional incentive to move there. Lastly, it is worth noting that both Jamestown and Dapperton are located in Minnesota and are several hundred miles apart, meaning that Jennifer will still be able to enjoy the state's natural beauty and quality of life in either city. However, her environmentalist values and preferences for cleaner energy sources make Dapperton the more appropriate choice. In conclusion, considering Jennifer's stance on the environment and her commitment to preserving the Earth, she should avoid moving to Jamestown due to its reliance on coal-generated electricity and its associated environmental impacts. Instead, she should consider Dapperton, which utilizes a cleaner, albeit finite, energy source in the form of nuclear power and offers local attractions that align with her interests and contribute to her well-being."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

The structure resembles a cross section of a swimming pool, essentially two concave ramps (or quarter-pipes), topped by copings and decks, facing each other across a flat transition, also known as a \\"tranny\\". Originally half-pipes were half sections of a large diameter pipe. Since the 1980s, half-pipes contain an extended \\"flat bottom\\" between the quarter-pipes; the original style half-pipes are no longer built. Flat ground provides time to regain balance after landing and more time to prepare for the next trick.  - Italy, officially the Italian Republic, is a unitary parliamentary republic in Europe.

Given the question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person whose art also bears some stylistic resemblance to the work of European post-impressionists such as Vincent van Gogh? , can you please find it?   Thomson was largely self-taught. His experiences as a graphic designer with Toronto's Grip Ltd. honed his draughtsmanship. Although he began painting and drawing at an early age, it was only in 1912, when he was well into his thirties, that he began to paint seriously. His first trips to Algonquin Park inspired him to follow the lead of fellow artists in producing oil sketches of natural scenes on small, rectangular panels for easy portability while travelling. Between 1912 and his death in 1917, Thomson produced hundreds of these small sketches, many of which are now considered works in their own right, and are mostly found in the Art Gallery of Ontario in Toronto, the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg and the Tom Thomson Art Gallery in Owen Sound.Thomson produced nearly all of his works between 1912 and 1917. Most of his large canvases were completed in his most productive period, from late 1916 to early 1917. The patronage of James MacCallum enabled Thomson's transition from graphic designer to professional painter. Although the Group of Seven was not founded until after his death, his work was sympathetic to that of group members A. Y. Jackson, Frederick Varley, and Arthur Lismer. These artists shared an appreciation for rugged, unkempt natural scenery, and all used broad brush strokes and a liberal application of paint to capture the beauty and colour of the Ontario landscape. Thomson's art also bears some stylistic resemblance to the work of European post-impressionists such as Vincent van Gogh. Other key influences were the Art Nouveau and Arts and Crafts movements of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, styles with which he became familiar while working in the graphic arts. The answer is:","output":"Tom"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. (Click to read the question--but in brief, it had to do with why one guy named Bill had managed to discourage unwanted pursuit by a gal named Janet, when another guy named Bill had not.) Does it follow that \\"Click to read the question, which is about a guy named Bill, said the website.\\"?","output":"It does not directly follow that \\"Click to read the question, which is about a guy named Bill, said the website,\\" because there is not enough context to fully understand the scenario. However, from the given context, we can infer that the question is related to a situation where two individuals named Bill had different outcomes in discouraging unwanted pursuit by a woman named Janet. To provide a detailed and long answer, let's dive deeper into possible reasons for the difference in outcomes. 1. Communication Style: One Bill might have been more effective in communicating his disinterest when encountering Janet's pursuit. Clear and direct communication is essential in these circumstances. This Bill may have expressed his lack of interest in a way that left no room for ambiguity, ensuring Janet would not persist with her pursuit. 2. Persistence: In contrast, the other Bill might have been less successful in discouraging Janet due to her persistence. Sometimes people do not take a hint or give up easily, leading to continued unwanted pursuit. 3. Personality Differences: People's personalities could have played a significant role in the effectiveness of each Bill's attempt to discourage Janet. One Bill's personality may have aligned more closely with Janet's, making it harder for her to let go of her pursuit, whereas the other Bill may have had a personality that clashed or did not resonate with Janet's, making it easier for her to accept his disinterest. 4. Initial Attraction Level: The level of initial attraction could have influenced the effectiveness of each Bill's attempt to discourage Janet. The Bill who was initially less attractive to Janet might have had an easier time convincing her to relinquish her pursuit, while the other Bill, who was more attractive to Janet, may have had a harder time getting her to back off. 5. Social Circle and Environment: Different social environments and the presence or absence of mutual friends can also impact the effectiveness of discouraging unwanted pursuit. One Bill may have been in a social setting where it was easier to avoid or navigate away from Janet's pursuit, while the other Bill could have found himself consistently in close proximity to Janet due to overlapping social circles or other factors. 6. Timing: Timing can play a crucial role in the success of discouraging unwanted pursuit. One Bill may have communicated his disinterest at an opportune time when Janet was more emotionally equipped to handle the rejection, while the other Bill may have expressed his disinterest when Janet was more vulnerable or emotionally invested, making it difficult for her to accept and move on. In conclusion, it does not follow directly that \\"Click to read the question, which is about a guy named Bill, said the website,\\" as the context provided is limited. However, based on the context given, we can hypothesize that there are various factors, such as communication style, personality differences, initial attraction level, social environment, and timing, that have influenced the success of each Bill's attempts to discourage unwanted pursuit by Janet."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

In this case, the sentence is: \\"The movie has generic virtues, and despite a lot of involved talent, seems done by the numbers.\\" We can break this down into a few key phrases: 1. \\"generic virtues\\" - This phrase usually means common or ordinary positive aspects. \\"Generic\\" could be interpreted as a little negative, but \\"virtues\\" is a positive term. So, the sentiment of this phrase is slightly positive. 2. \\"despite a lot of involved talent\\" - This phrase suggests that there are talented people involved with the movie, which is generally a positive notion. 3. \\"seems done by the numbers\\" - This phrase implies that the movie follows a formulaic approach and is not very original or creative. This gives a negative sentiment to the sentence. As we assess these key phrases, we can see that the sentence has a mixture of slightly positive and negative sentiments.

Other public festivals were not required by the calendar, but occasioned by events. The triumph of a Roman general was celebrated as the fulfillment of religious vows, though these tended to be overshadowed by the political and social significance of the event. During the late Republic, the political elite competed to outdo each other in public display, and the ludi attendant on a triumph were expanded to include gladiator contests. Under the Principate, all such spectacular displays came under Imperial control: the most lavish were subsidised by emperors, and lesser events were provided by magistrates as a sacred duty and privilege of office. Additional festivals and games celebrated Imperial accessions and anniversaries. Others, such as the traditional Republican Secular Games to mark a new era (saeculum), became imperially funded to maintain traditional values and a common Roman identity. That the spectacles retained something of their sacral aura even in late antiquity is indicated by the admonitions of the Church Fathers that Christians should not take part. If it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): Under what auspices did public displays  come during the Principate?","output":"Under the Principate, which is a title that was held by the first Roman Emperor, Augustus, and the ones that came after him, all the big, showy public displays came under their control.

They are the descendants of free blacks and of escaped slaves (called maroons) who allied with Seminole groups in Spanish Florida. Historically, the Black Seminoles lived mostly in distinct bands near the Native American Seminole. Some were held as slaves of particular Seminole leaders; but they had more freedom than did slaves held by whites in the South and by other Native American tribes, including the right to bear arms. The Black Seminole culture that took shape after 1800 was a dynamic mixture of African, Native American, Spanish, and slave traditions. Adopting certain practices of the Native Americans, maroons wore Seminole clothing and ate the same foodstuffs prepared the same way: they gathered the roots of a native plant called coontie, grinding, soaking, and straining them to make a starchy flour similar to arrowroot, as well as mashing corn with a mortar and pestle to make sofkee, a sort of porridge often used as a beverage, with water added-- ashes from the fire wood used to cook the sofkee were occasionally added to it for extra flavor. They also introduced their Gullah staple of rice to the Seminole, and continued to use it as a basic part of their diets. Rice remained part of the diet of the Black Seminoles who moved to Oklahoma.  Initially living apart from the Native Americans, the maroons developed their own unique African-American culture, based in the Gullah culture of the Lowcountry. Black Seminoles inclined toward a syncretic form of Christianity developed during the plantation years. Certain cultural practices, such as \\"jumping the broom\\" to celebrate marriage, hailed from the plantations; other customs, such as some names used for black towns, reflected African heritage.  As time progressed, the Seminole and Blacks had limited intermarriage, but historians and anthropologists have come to believe that generally the Black Seminoles had independent communities. They allied with the Seminole at times of war. The Seminole society was based on a matrilineal kinship system, in which inheritance and descent went through the maternal line. Children were considered to belong to the mother's clan, so those born to ethnic African mothers would have been considered black by the Seminole. While the children might integrate customs from both parents' cultures, the Seminole believed they belonged to the mother's group more than the father's.  African Americans adopted some elements of the European-American patriarchal system. But, under the South's adoption of the principle of partus sequitur ventrem in the 17th century and incorporated into slavery law in slave states, children of slave mothers were considered legally slaves. Under the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850, even if the mother escaped to a free state, she and her children were legally considered slaves and fugitives. As a result, the Black Seminoles born to slave mothers were always at risk from slave raiders.

The target of the raid is General Erwin Rommel of the German Afrika Korps, who is enjoying considerable success against British troops in North Africa. The daring raid produces plenty of casualties but misses Rommel. Rommel is gaining legendary status with his British enemies.A captured British Lieutenant Colonel, Desmond Young, soon has a chance encounter with the celebrated Rommel in the midst of a desert artillery barrage. Rommel treats Young with respect and chivalry, inspiring the British officer after the war to investigate the life and mysterious death of the great general.Rommel's story is told in retrospect, beginning with the defeat of German forces at El Alamein in late 1942. Rommel, by now a Field Marshal, had been away from the front on medical leave, but he is forced to return in an attempt to stem the British tide. Rommel fights gallantly but becomes increasingly disenchanted with Hitler's interference and maniacal insistence on victory or death.Shortly before the total defeat of German forces in North Africa in the spring of 1943, Rommel is again invalided back to Germany. In the hospital, Rommel is visited by his wife Lucie (Jessica Tandy), his son Manfred, and Dr. Karl Strolin (Cedric Hardwicke), the Lord Mayor of Stuttgart and an early conspirator against Hitler. Strolin's presence arouses the suspicion of the SS and Gestapo. Rommel confides to Strolin that Hitler has accused him of cowardice and hinted at having him shot, and that Hitler had callously abandoned his beloved Afrika Korps. He further confides that Hitler no longer believes victory is possible, and that he only fights on because the Allies would never make peace with him.

It's an ackward moment at Dr. Who (Peter Cushing)'s home, as he is about to meet Ian (Ron Castle), who happens to be the boyfriend of his daughter Barbara (Jennie Linden). She tells her younger sister, Susan \\"Susy\\" (Roberta Tovey) to tend to the door up. This is no ordinary family, as Susy had been reading a huge book, by Physics for the Enquiring Mind by Eric M. Roberts, highly advanced for somebody of such a young age - alike the bigger sister, who was reading Science Is Science, and it's grandfather who's reading a science-fiction comic. Ian is clumsy and stubles on entering... again. Ian has brought a present, but Dr. Who insists in showing him his last invention. Susy thinks that Ian is so stupid, he won't understand it, but they three go out to the street to check of the red phone booth. Ian is amazed about how big it's on the inside. The machine will transport everything in time and place.Barbara appears and jumps to Ian's arms. He steps back and sets the machine onto motion with the four of them inside. The scenery immediately changes: they are on a place of jungle twigs and burnt soil called Skaro. It's another planet. Susan is excited to have the opportunity to go around and investigate. She find a kind of alien flower. Barbara screams at the small statue of a crocrodile. On the mayhem, Ian falls onto the thing and breaks it.Susan find the lights of empty buildings. Barbara starts thinking that something terrible happened in that place, and that it's dangerous. Ian tells Dr. Who that he's expected at home, so that they must return. Finally, who obliges. Susan gets lost because she finds another of those beautiful flowers. She runs away because a hand has touched her, but nobody seems to believe her.Back at the phone booth, they cannot see anyone with their surveillance cameras, but Susy insists that she was touched on the shoulder. There are knocks on the door, which startle Ian, but there isn't anybody around. They try to leave, but can't, and when they step aside, Susan courageously picks up a small blue container - it's has four small tubes with a liquid inside.They go to the city, which looks empty. Dr. Who gets tired easily. They enter an empty home with different rooms. Ian's door is the only one which doesn't open automatically, as he needs to touch something. Barbara walks a long corridor, and it looks as though she's being watched. She ends up being trapped and screams. Susan sits on the spot to open up the door. Susy, Ian and Who follow a noise to a communication room. Dr. Who looks tired. When they turn around, the three of them find themselves surrounded by Daleks. Ian is left dizzy by the Daleks, who also took the object which they found. They reunite with Barbara in a room/cell.Temmosus (Geoffrey Toone), Antodus (John Bown), Dyoni (Yvonne Antrobus) and Elyon (Mark Petersen). Some of them believe the letter offering to be their friends - supposedly written by Susan. Who devises a plan to escape using Susan's cape as an insulator. At that moment, a Dalek appears to bring them food, they put food in their periscope and attack it by blinding its eye with the disgusting food. Ian gets into the blue Dalek. There is also the image of a kind of green claw, a proof of the mutations which have taken place in the . Susan leads the way, and pretends to be the blue Dale's prisoner. They are soon found out anyway, so they have to break the lift, but the blue Dalek with Ian inside can't get into it. Now we realise that finally, Ian unstuck the head and was able to leave it in time.The four humans arrive in time to tell the Thals that they cannot hide in the forst forever. In fact, the Daleks are planning to bomb all the planet. However, the Thals have become peaceful, too peaceful. It was war which destroyed the planet and caused all the destruction and polution in Skaro. The Thals insist, and even the death of one of them was not convincing. Dr. Who tells Ian to take Dyoni to the Daleks. The leader won't allow it, so that settles the matter: they will have to fightSusan and Ian with cross a mutant-infested swamp with some Thals. On their way, they find the tubes which are polluting the water. Elyon stays behind to take some samples of the water, when he is eaten by something from the river.The Daleks are reuniting: they want to destroy the Thals forever. The other four follow the pipes to some caves. There is a fight between the two remaining Thals, because one of them wants to go back and forget the city.Who was supposed te watch some cakes, but they get burnt, to Susan's disappointment. Two female ladies are looking at themselves in the mirror, which gives Who an idea. Ian has to jump over a cliff, which he does, but then one of the Thals seems to have second thoughts over the whole ordeal. With plenty of mirrors, Who and the thals will make the detectors useless. The Daleks start to move on. Dr Who and Susan are captured again. The Daleks start the countdown for the bomb.Finally, one of the Daleks decides that they must fight. Dr. Who offers his time machine if the Daleks don't explode the bomb, but the Daleks will figure it out how it works after having exploded the bomb. Susan, Ian and the two Thals enter the Dalek's castle and run away using another lift. Finally, the rest of the Daleks fight.They reach control room. Two Daleks destroy one another. The Daleks destroy the computer when trying to kill Ian. All the Daleks are dead - three seconds left, which Ian alleges it's his lucky number.Why fills up the energy of the time machine.

Question: Question: Who is the wisest of the three mothers? If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Mother of Tears Context: The film begins with members of the Catholic Church digging up the body of a 19th-century church official, whose casket has a box-shaped urn chained to it. Inside the box they discover artifacts belonging to Mater Lachrymarum (Moran Atias), the last surviving member of the Three Mothers; an ancient trio of powerful black witches. In particular, the box contains a magic cloak that, when worn by Mater Lachrymarum, increases her powers significantly. The urn is shipped to the Museum of Ancient Art in Rome where Sarah Mandy (Asia Argento), an American studying art restoration, works. Sarah is dating the curator Michael Pierce, a single father who is away from the museum that night. With help from the assistant curator, Sarah opens the box and finds the cloak, a dagger, and three statues representing the three witches. Sending Sarah to her office to retrieve tools to help her translate the text on the artifacts, the curator is promptly attacked by the demonic agents of Mater Lachrymarum. Sarah arrives too late to save her boss (who is being disembowelled by the monsters) and starts to flee the museum. Unfortunately, she is pursued by Mater Lachrymarum's familiar (a baboon) and is only able to escape when a disembodied voice magically throws open a series of locked doors keeping her trapped inside the museum. Sarah tells the police what happened as she spends the night with Michael and his son. Michael visits the Cardinal who sent him the urn only to find out that, shortly after mailing the urn to him, he had a severe stroke and is now in a coma. An assistant of the priest gives Michael a piece of paper, which the Cardinal was writing on before collapsing. On it is scrawled the name \\"Mater Lachrymarum\\". As he leaves the hospital, a pair of witches observe Michael leaving the building. Back in Rome, chaos descends as a wave of mass suicides, murder, and violence engulfs the city.

Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","output":"In order to analyze this situation, it's important to differentiate between the premise, which is a statement that is assumed to be true, and the hypothesis, which is a proposed explanation or assumption based on limited evidence. We will then determine if the truth of the premise will make the hypothesis true. The Premise: \\"Jane shook her head.\\" In this statement, we understand that Jane made a motion with her head, typically from side to side, which often signifies disagreement or disapproval.  The Hypothesis: \\"Jane waved her head.\\" This statement suggests that Jane made another movement with her head. Waving one's head is a somewhat ambiguous term, as it could imply a few different motions; However, for the purpose of this discussion, we can assume that it means Jane moved her head in a back-and-forth motion. Now, to evaluate whether the truth of the premise guarantees the truth of the hypothesis, we need to see if there is a logical connection between the two statements. From the language used in these statements, it can be inferred that these are two distinct actions. Shaking one's head, as previously noted, is a side-to-side movement, whereas waving one's head is assumed to be a different motion (likely back and forth). Consequently, we can say that there is no direct logical connection between the premise and the hypothesis. Therefore, it is not possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis is true as well. The truth of the premise (Jane shaking her head) does not guarantee the truth of the hypothesis (Jane waving her head), since these are separate actions and don't have a clear causal relationship. It is entirely possible for Jane to shake her head (disagree or express disapproval) without waving her head.

He had the good opportunity to see various tidal conditions. First he saw the spring tide, which he noted as case A. About a week later he saw the neap tide. He noted that as case B. Rob got curious about the science behind various tidal conditions.  But I can use this background: When the Moon is at first quarter or third quarter, the Sun and Moon are separated by 90° when viewed from the Earth, and the solar tidal force partially cancels the Moon's tidal force. At these points in the lunar cycle, the tide's range is at its minimum; this is called the neap tide, or neaps.  Neap is an Anglo-Saxon word meaning \\"without the power\\", as in forðganges nip (forth-going without-the-power).Spring tides result in high waters that are higher than average, low waters that are lower than average, 'slack water' time that is shorter than average, and stronger tidal currents than average. Neaps result in less extreme tidal conditions. There is about a seven-day interval between springs and neaps.  What is an answer for this question: In which case the low waters would be higher, case A or case B? A:","output":"In case B, the low waters would be higher. This is because case B refers to the neap tide, during which the tidal range is at its minimum. Neap tides have less extreme tidal conditions, meaning the high waters are not as high and the low waters are not as low compared to the spring tide (case A). In contrast, the spring tide (case A) has high waters that are higher than average and low waters that are lower than average.

Please answer the following question: Use information from the paragraph to answer the question.  Question:   Will induces diffusion in a gas and a liquid. The gas likely diffuses much faster or slower?    Paragraph :  This is also called diffusion, and the process is much faster in gases than in liquids, because the particles in gases are further apart. A:","output":"Based on the given paragraph, the process of diffusion is much faster in gases than in liquids. The primary reason for this increased rate of diffusion in gases is attributed to the fact that particles in gases are further apart from each other compared to those in liquids. Diffusion is the process in which particles spread out evenly within a given space as a result of their inherent kinetic energy, which drives them to move randomly. In both gases and liquids, molecules are in constant motion, colliding with each other and their container walls. However, there are some key factors that cause the difference in diffusion rates between gases and liquids: 1. Particle spacing: In gases, the particles are spaced much further apart than they are in liquids. This allows them to travel greater distances without being obstructed by neighboring particles, making diffusion more efficient. In contrast, the particles in liquids are more tightly packed together, which results in more frequent collisions, thereby slowing down the rate of diffusion. 2. Kinetic energy: Since gas molecules possess higher kinetic energy than liquid molecules, they tend to move at faster speeds, resulting in quicker diffusion. The increased movement and speed of these gas particles contribute to the overall faster rate of diffusion compared to that in liquids. 3. Intermolecular forces: Lower intermolecular forces in gases allow the particles to move more freely than in liquids, where these forces are much stronger. The stronger forces in liquids keep particles relatively closer, thus slowing down the diffusion process as the particles encounter more resistance while moving. In conclusion, induced diffusion in a gas occurs at a much faster rate than in a liquid due to the greater spacing between gas particles, their higher kinetic energy, and the weaker intermolecular forces present in gases compared to liquids."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

(CNN) -- The U.S. space shuttle program retired in 2011, leaving American astronauts to hitchhike into orbit. But after three long years, NASA's successor is almost ready to make an entrance. Orion, the agency's newest manned spaceship, is being prepared for its first mission in December. In future missions, it will journey into deep space -- to Mars and beyond -- farther than humans have ever gone before. Orion comes loaded with superlatives. It boasts the largest heat shield ever built and a computer 400 times faster than the ones on the space shuttles. It will be launched into space on the most powerful rocket NASA has ever made. No astronauts will be aboard the December flight, which will test the spacecraft's systems for future manned missions. Final work on the spacecraft is under way at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Orion came one step closer to completion this month with the stacking of the crew module atop the service module. \\"Now that we're getting so close to launch, the spacecraft completion work is visible every day,\\" Orion Program Manager Mark Geyer said in a statement. A 3,600-mile journey When complete, the Orion capsule will resemble a fencing foil, with a tall spire shooting up from a rounded base. At the top will sit a launch abort system, with downward-facing thrusters that would save the crew from a jarring crash in the event of a rocket malfunction. The bottom portion, the service module, will perform various functions such as in-space propulsion and cargo storage. Nestled between the two will be the crew module, capable of supporting human life from launch until recovery. Attached to the service module will be a United Launch Alliance Delta IV Heavy rocket. For the first time since the space shuttle's debut launch in 1981, the crew compartment will ride on the tip of the rocket rather than hanging onto its side, evoking the configuration of the famous Apollo or Gemini missions.

But so, evidently, was the Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe, according to a recent study. Brahe, who was born in 1546 and died in 1601, was a keen observer of the heavens. But he also was exposed to enough gold while he was alive for it to show up in tests of his hair— in fact, researchers found about 20 to 100 times the amount of gold in hair samples from Brahe’s corpse than is normal today. The hair came from his eyebrows, beard, and scalp, and the scientists also found evidence in his bones that he’d been exposed to gold. The work was carried out by Kaare Lund Rasmussen, an associate professor at the University of Southern Denmark. Brahe’s body was exhumed in 2010. DA VINCI DISCOVERY: RARE DRAWING, VALUED AT 16 MILLION, FOUND “We found traces of gold in Tycho Brahe's hair, and we can establish that he was exposed to gold while these hairs were still on his body,” Rasmussen said, in a statement. He thinks that Brahe got the gold into his system because of his lifestyle— like the plates from which he ate. “It may have been the cutlery and plates of gold, or maybe the wine he drank contained gold leaf. It's also possible that he concocted and consumed elixirs containing gold, or that he worked with alchemy,” Rasmussen said. While gold was found in the highest amounts, the researchers also found evidence of other substances, like silver, arsenic, and iron, though not enough to poison the famed Renaissance astronomer. And while some had thought that Brahe had died from mercury poisoning, this research and past research shows that wasn’t the case. FEATHERED DINOSAUR TAIL FRAGMENT TRAPPED IN AMBER AMAZES SCIENTISTS The researchers were even able to figure out, based on Brahe’s hair and how it grew, that his exposure to the gold and other elements actually decreased in a period of about two months before he died. That means that the astronomer might have been weak before he passed away, and unable to spend time in his laboratory. “What Tycho Brahe died of is therefore still uncertain,” Rasmussen added. One theory has it that he died from an infected bladder. Brahe is also known for his nose, or lack thereof. He lost part of it in a sword fight, and wore a prosthesis— that metal piece was made of brass, previous research showed, not silver, as had been thought. The study about the golden hair was published in the journal Archaeometry.

Answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What date did Jimi Hendrix play Maple Leaf Gardens? ?  In 1969, American rock musician Jimi Hendrix, who was then at the height of his career, was arrested, tried, and acquitted in Canada for drug possession. On May 3, 1969, customs agents at Toronto International Airport detained Hendrix after finding a small amount of what they suspected to be heroin and hashish in his luggage. Four hours later, after a mobile lab confirmed what had been found, he was formally charged with drug possession. Released on 10,000 bail, Hendrix was required to return on May 5 for an arraignment hearing. During a performance at Maple Leaf Gardens later that night, he displayed a jovial attitude, joking with the audience and singing a few lines of mock opera for comedic effect. At a preliminary hearing on June 19, Judge Robert Taylor set a date for December 8, at which Hendrix would stand trial for two counts of illegal possession of narcotics, for which he faced as many as 20 years in prison. While there was no question as to whether the drugs were in Hendrix's luggage, in order for the Crown to prove possession they had to show that he knew they were there. In his cross-examination of Canadian customs officials, defense attorney John O'Driscoll raised doubts about whether the narcotics belonged to Hendrix, who had no drug paraphernalia in his luggage or needle tracks on his arms. After a trial that lasted for three days, the jury deliberated for 8 hours before returning a not guilty verdict, acquitting Hendrix of both charges. The incident proved stressful for Hendrix, and it weighed heavily on his mind during the seven months that he awaited trial. Two weeks after the arrest, he told his friend, journalist Sharon Lawrence, that his fear of needles discouraged him from using heroin and that associating with junkies had convinced him it was not a drug he wanted to use. Both of Hendrix's Experience bandmates, Mitch Mitchell and Noel Redding, later stated that they had been warned about a planned drug bust the day before flying to Toronto and they believed that drugs had been planted...

Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","output":"Yes, both of these questions seem to be inquiring about the same basic idea: how does the technology behind a metro smart card operate? So here is a detailed answer: Metro smart cards, like many other types of smart cards, are based on a technology known as radio frequency identification (RFID). RFID technology enables contactless communication between the card and the card reader. This technology is also found in a variety of other settings, such as in access control systems, inventory tracking systems, and even in some credit cards. The smart card itself contains an embedded microprocessor, which is essentially a small computer with its own memory and operating system. The microprocessor is what allows the card to store and process information. For a metro smart card, the most important piece of information is likely the cardholder's balance, or the amount of money currently available on the card for use in paying metro fares. The process works as follows: 1. When you approach the metro gate to enter, you will engage with a card reader. This reader uses radio waves to communicate with the RFID chip in your metro smart card. You don't have to insert your card into a slot or swipe it through a reader, you just have to bring it close to the reader (usually within a few centimeters). 2. The reader will send a signal to the chip in your card, \\"waking it up\\" so that it can communicate with the reader. The signal contains a request for information, specifically the information that the card's microprocessor has stored about your account balance. 3. The microprocessor will then communicate with the card reader, sending the requested information back to the reader. At the same time, the microprocessor may also update its own records, subtracting the appropriate fare from your account balance. 4. Once the reader has received the information from your card, it will open the metro gate, allowing you to enter. The process is typically extremely quick and can often be completed in less than a second. An additional benefit of using RFID technology in smart cards is its security. Because the cards use radio waves for communication, the card doesn't have to leave your hand to be read, which decreases the chance of it being lost or stolen. Furthermore, the information communicated between the card and the reader is typically encrypted, to protect against unauthorized access. In short, metro smart cards and their associated readers represent an efficient system for managing fares in a public transportation setting. Through the use of sophisticated RFID and microprocessor technologies, these cards can provide quick, secure access to the metro system while also updating and storing information about the cardholder's account balance."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Movie title: The Three Musketeers Movie plot: In 1625 France, following in his late fathers footsteps, D'Artagnan (Chris O'Donnell) sets off to Paris in hopes of becoming a member of the Musketeers, a band of men sworn to serve and protect the King of France. D'Artagnan is pursued by Gérard and his brothers, who accuse him of blemishing their sister's honor. Gérard had saw his sister kissing D'Artagnan goodbye or as D'Artagnan put it \\"she wanted to give me something to remember her by!\\". At Musketeer headquarters, Captain Rochefort (Michael Wincott) and the cardinal's guards have disbanded the musketeers as per the orders of Cardinal Richelieu (Tim Curry), the King's minister, ostensibly to help fight in an impending war with England. Rochefort confides to the Cardinal that there are three musketeers that have refused to relinquish their duties: Athos (Kiefer Sutherland), Porthos (Oliver Platt), and Aramis (Charlie Sheen).Upon reaching Paris, the headstrong D'Artagnan has a series of chance physical encounters with these same three musketeers, resulting in D'Artagnan accepting a sword duel with each one that very day. D'Artagnan arrives at the Ruins for his first duel and, much to his surprise, Athos, Porthos and Aramis reveal themselves as musketeers.

Answer: Tensions were abated by a gentleman's agreement in which Duisenberg would stand down before the end of his mandate, to be replaced by Trichet.  A single-select problem: Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion? Available options: * yes. * no.","output":"The French, German, Dutch, and Belgian governments finally came to a compromise in regards to managing the European Central Bank (ECB) after a series of negotiations. The primary issue at stake was the selection of the ECB president and the influence each country would have within the central bank. The eventual compromise centered around the appointment of the ECB's first president and his successor, as well as reaching agreements on other aspects, such as voting rights and rotating seats, to ensure a more balanced representation of the member countries. The origins of the disagreement lay in the different preferences of these countries for the ECB presidency. The German government favored Wim Duisenberg, the Dutch central bank governor, while the French government preferred Jean-Claude Trichet, the French central bank governor. To resolve this stalemate, a gentleman's agreement was made. According to this agreement, Duisenberg would become the first ECB president but would step down before the end of his eight-year term, allowing Trichet to become his successor. In addition to the gentleman's agreement, the compromise included modifications in the decision-making process within the ECB. These alterations aimed to resolve concerns about the power dynamics among the eurozone countries. One prominent change was the introduction of a rotating system for voting rights on the Governing Council, the main decision-making body of the ECB. Under the revised structure, the number votes on the Governing Council would be changed to ensure greater fairness. The six largest eurozone economies would share four votes on a rotating basis, while the remaining smaller eurozone countries would share 11 votes. This new system offered a better balance of voting power for both large and small economies within the European Union. In conclusion, the French, German, Dutch, and Belgian governments were able to compromise on the management of the ECB by addressing the conflicts surrounding the appointment of the president and decision-making dynamics. The gentleman's agreement, which allowed Duisenberg to serve an abbreviated term as the ECB's first president, followed by Trichet, resolved disagreements over the leadership issue. Additionally, modifications to the voting rights and the decision-making structure within the ECB ensured a more balanced representation of member countries, satisfying the concerns of various governments."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Venus will again cross the face of the sun... (Associated Press)      The nearly 7-hour show can be seen in its entirety from the western Pacific, eastern Asia and eastern Australia. Other parts of the globe will catch portions of the transit.      Here's a sampling of local viewing times: 12:10 p.m. Honolulu, 3:06 p.m. Los Angeles, 5:06 p.m. Mexico City, 6:04 p.m. New York _ all on Tuesday _ and 5:37 a.m. London, 6:10 a.m. Beijing, 6:38 a.m. Cairo, 7:10 a.m. Tokyo, 8:16 a.m. Sydney, 10:15 a.m. Auckland on Wednesday.

The phenomenon, which occurs when Venus's orbit brings the planet between Earth and the sun, takes place roughly twice a century—the last transit was on June 8, 2004—and won't happen again until 2117.      One of the rarest of celestial events will take place today--the next transit of Venus, when the planet will appear as a small, dark disk moving across the face of the sun. Jenny Zhou has details on Lunch Break. Photo: NASA.      Unlike in a solar eclipse, in which the moon temporarily obscures the sun, Venus will appear as a small black dot passing across the sun in the daytime sky. Spectators are advised to wear special solar eyeglasses, or dark, polarized lenses such as welder's glasses, to prevent eye damage.      Venus will slide between the Sun and Earth next week, the last such transit for 117 years. Video: Reuters      Richard Vondrak, deputy director of Solar System Exploration at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center, said studying the event is \\"important in understanding our place in space.\\" The transit of Venus was critical to the determination of Earth's distance from the sun, and thus the size of the solar system, Dr. Vondrak said. In the late 19th century, scientists finally ascertained the distance based on data from several transits, after a mathematician first proposed observing the transits back in 1663.      Enlarge Image Close Associated Press This June 8, 2004, file photo shows the transit of Venus, which occurs when the planet Venus passes between the Earth and the Sun, is pictured in Hong Kong.      Jay M. Pasachoff, an astronomy professor at Williams College in Williamstown, Mass., said such events continue to provide scientists with insight into planets in Earth's solar system and beyond. Dr. Pasachoff, who will be in Maui, Hawaii, for the transit, will be studying it for clues to Venus's atmosphere as sunlight passes through the outer rim of the planet. He said scientists hope the same method can be used to study atmospheres on exoplanets, distant planets outside the solar system.      Viewers on the East Coast of the U.S. can watch the transit of Venus with their protective glasses from 6 p.m. EDT until sunset, Dr. Vondrak said. It can be viewed from most parts of the world, but not from Portugal or from big swaths of Spain, South America and Africa.      From many parts of Europe, people will be able to view the latter part of the 6½-hour transit after sunrise. Alaska and Hawaii are the only two states from which it will be possible to view the full transit.      Dr. Vondrak said people can watch the transit without special glasses by tuning in to NASA's live webcast of the event from Mauna Kea, Hawaii, starting at 5:45 p.m. EDT.      \\"So many people are missing the fact that it's a 21st-century topic,\\" Dr. Pasachoff said. \\"It gives us a last chance in over 100 years to test ideas about distant planets.\\" ||||| The rare Transit of Venus is coming Tuesday afternoon in the United States, and it's a once-in-a-lifetime viewing chance for West Coast viewers. The next time this astronomical phenomena will happen is 2117.      At its heart, the exquisite show in the heavens is simple — Venus will cross paths between the sun and the Earth, and Earthlings will see a tiny dot floating across the surface of the sun over several hours.      How to view the Transit of Venus? You could buy a pair of solar glasses from a planetarium, like the Griffith Observatory in Los Angeles, which will sell them Tuesday after 12 p.m. for 2.99 a pair. An even better view, also at the Observatory, is seeing the transit magnified by a telescope, equipped with special solar filters.      PHOTO GALLERY: Solar eclipse      You can also try buying No. 14 welder's glass from a welder's shop or home improvement store. Or use a pair of binoculars, preferably with more than seven times magnification, to project the sun's light onto the sidewalk or a piece of paper. If you're able to find an image of the sun, look for a tiny dot showing the image of Venus.      Don't look at the sun directly. The sun's rays are so bright it will obscure Venus, and you could damage your vision. If all else fails, watch a live NASA webcast from Hawaii.      This week's viewing will be only the eighth time the Transit of Venus has happened since the telescope was invented, according to NASA's Fred Espenak. It will begin at 3:06 p.m. Pacific Daylight Time, and hit the center of its journey at 6:25 p.m. The sun sets in Los Angeles at 8:02 p.m., but in points west — such as Alaska, Hawaii, Australia, eastern Asia, and most of Europe — the show will go on for two more hours. (The transit will occur on Wednesday for points west of the International Date Line.)      As long as clouds don't interfere with the view, most of the world will be able to see at least part of the Transit of Venus, except for southeastern South America, western Africa, Portugal and Spain.      Entire lifetimes can go by with no one being able to see a Transit of Venus, but we're living in a lucky time to see what Espenak calls one of the rarest of planetary alignments. The viewings occur only twice every 120 years. Since the telescope's invention, Espenak says, it was only viewable in 1631, 1639, 1761, 1769, 1874 and 1882; the last viewable transit happened in 2004 but happened before sunrise in the western United States. ||||| A:","output":"This task asks you to summarize multiple news articles separated by the token \\"|||||\\". The articles discuss a rare astronomical event called the transit of Venus, in which Venus passes between the Earth and the Sun. The event occurs roughly twice a century, and the last one happened on June 8, 2004. The next one will not occur until 2117. To view the transit safely, you should wear special solar eyeglasses or dark, polarized lenses, such as welder's glasses. The transit is important for understanding Earth's place in space and can provide clues about the atmospheres of planets in our solar system and beyond. The transit can be viewed from most parts of the world, but not from Portugal, big parts of Spain, South America, and Africa.

Answer the following question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: When the Fabre family move into their dream house with wonderful neighbors, everything seems perfect except for one thing â the youngest child Ludovic wishes to function as a girl; while he was born a boy, he feels that he is a girl and wants to live as a female. The rest of the family humor him as best they can, rationalizing that Ludovic is only trying to find his identity and will soon be over it . Trouble begins when Ludovic befriends JÃ©rÃ´me, the son of her father's boss, and expresses a desire to marry him when Ludovic is finally a girl. When visiting JÃ©rÃ´me's house, Ludovic enters his sister's room and puts on one of her dresses, not realizing that the sister is deceased and the room was merely kept in memory of her. JÃ©rÃ´me's mother sees this and she and the rest of the neighbors are horrified. The community turns against Ludovic and, by extension, the rest of the Fabre family. After Ludovic stands in as Snow White in a school play, the parents of the other students send in a petition to have him expelled. Ludovic's father, under strain as an employee of JÃ©rÃ´me's father, is unable to cope and causes conflict within the family. After a particularly bad argument, Ludovic attempts to mend the situation by hiding in a freezer to commit suicide. He is found in time and allowed to wear a skirt to a neighborhood party. While the other neighbors greet him warmly, Ludo's father gets fired the next day and finds his house spray-painted with graffiti. Ludo runs out of the house, distraught. Hanna, Ludovic's mother, blames him for everything that has gone wrong. She wants to set Ludo straight, so she cuts his hair to make him look like his brothers. Ludo grows resentment towards his mother for doing this, ultimately deciding that he wants to live with his grandmother. When Ludo and his grandmother go visit his parents one weekend, the father announces that he has a new job, but it is out of town and they have to move.

Pronouns generally refer to the noun or noun phrase that immediately precedes them unless there is an obvious contradiction. In this case, the antecedent of the pronoun \\"he\\" is Sam. The pronoun \\"he\\" functions to avoid repeating the proper noun \\"Sam\\" in the sentence and maintains clarity and coherence. The context also supports the idea that 'he' and 'Sam' are the same. Sam's motivation to take French classes (eagerness to speak it fluently) aligns with the pronoun \\"he\\" referring to Sam. To provide additional clarity, the sentence could be rephrased: \\"Sam took French classes from Adam, because Sam was eager to speak it fluently.\\" In this instance, it appears that \\"he\\" and \\"Sam\\" refer to the same person.

Let's analyze each option in more detail: Option A: Remove the old screen and replace it with new material. In this option, you will be removing the damaged screen from the window and replacing it with a new, undamaged screen. This solution will provide you with a more consistent and satisfactory result. A new screen will have uniform mesh, which will provide better protection against bugs and debris while allowing proper air circulation. Additionally, a new screen will most likely have a longer life span than patching up the old screen with temporary solutions. Moreover, replacing the old screen will provide an aesthetically pleasing appearance, maintaining the look of the window and its surroundings. Option B: Buy a roll of duct tape and cover the hole on the inside then go outside and repeat the process. In this option, you would be using duct tape to cover the hole in the screen, both from the inside and the outside. While this may be a quick and easy fix, it is not the most reliable solution. Duct tape is a temporary fix and may not be the best choice for repairing damaged screens. The adhesive on the tape can wear off over time, causing it to peel away and expose the hole once again. This option may also affect the air circulation in an undesirable way, as the taped area will obstruct airflow in that region. Furthermore, using duct tape to cover the hole will not provide an aesthetically pleasing appearance, and it may degrade the overall look of the window and its surroundings.

Background: Thomas Cowperthwait Eakins (July 25, 1844 - June 25, 1916) was an American realist painter, photographer, sculptor, and fine arts educator. He is widely acknowledged to be one of the most important artists in American art history. For the length of his professional career, from the early 1870s until his health began to fail some 40 years later, Eakins worked exactingly from life, choosing as his subject the people of his hometown of Philadelphia. He painted several hundred portraits, usually of friends, family members, or prominent people in the arts, sciences, medicine, and clergy. Context: Eakins' first works upon his return from Europe included a large group of rowing scenes, eleven oils and watercolors in all, of which the first and most famous is Max Schmitt in a Single Scull (1871; also known as The Champion Single Sculling). Both his subject and his technique drew attention. His selection of a contemporary sport was \\"a shock to the artistic conventionalities of the city\\". Eakins placed himself in the painting, in a scull behind Schmitt, his name inscribed on the boat.  Typically, the work entailed critical observation of the painting's subject, as well as preparatory drawings of the figure and perspective plans of the scull in the water. Its preparation and composition indicates the importance of Eakins' academic training in Paris. It was a completely original conception, true to Eakins' firsthand experience, and an almost startlingly successful image for the artist, who had struggled with his first outdoor composition less than a year before. His first known sale was the watercolor The Sculler (1874). Most critics judged the rowing pictures successful and auspicious, but after the initial flourish, Eakins never revisited the subject of rowing and went on to other sports themes.  At the same time that he made these initial ventures into outdoor themes, Eakins produced a series of domestic Victorian interiors, often with his father, his sisters or friends as the subjects. Home Scene (1871), Elizabeth at the Piano (1875), The Chess Players (1876), and Elizabeth Crowell and her Dog (1874), each dark in tonality, focus on the unsentimental characterization of individuals adopting natural attitudes in their homes.  It was in this vein that in 1872 he painted his first large scale portrait, Kathrin, in which the subject, Kathrin Crowell, is seen in dim light, playing with a kitten. In 1874 Eakins and Crowell became engaged; they were still engaged five years later, when Crowell died of meningitis in 1879. Question: When did his career begin?

Q:The Madrigal Ocean and the Listy Ocean are two bodies of water currently under observation by scientists on a planet nearly identical to Earth. Although the studies have just started, the scientists have already discovered that the salinity of the Madrigal Ocean is much lower than that of the Listy Ocean. This isn't much information, but it's progress and the scientists are not going to stop their studies until they learn all that they can about these waters.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Is the Madrigal Ocean probably connected to more or less rivers than the Listy Ocean?  Hint: Located mostly in the Arctic north polar region in the middle of the Northern Hemisphere, the Arctic Ocean is almost completely surrounded by Eurasia and North America. It is partly covered by sea ice throughout the year and almost completely in winter. The Arctic Ocean's surface temperature and salinity vary seasonally as the ice cover melts and freezes; its salinity is the lowest on average of the five major oceans, due to low evaporation, heavy fresh water inflow from rivers and streams, and limited connection and outflow to surrounding oceanic waters with higher salinities. The summer shrinking of the ice has been quoted at 50%. The US National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) uses satellite data to provide a daily record of Arctic sea ice cover and the rate of melting compared to an average period and specific past years. A:","output":"The Madrigal Ocean is probably connected to more rivers than the Listy Ocean. This conclusion can be drawn based on the hint provided, which states that the Arctic Ocean has the lowest salinity among the five major oceans on Earth. The low salinity is due to factors like low evaporation, heavy freshwater inflow from rivers and streams, and limited connection to surrounding oceanic waters with higher salinities. Since the Madrigal Ocean has a lower salinity than the Listy Ocean, it would likely be linked to a greater number of rivers, similar to the Arctic Ocean. This would result in more freshwater being deposited into the Madrigal Ocean, thus reducing the overall salinity levels."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

As the can heats up, it may explode. The kinetic-molecular theory explains why. The air inside the rigid can of soup is given more kinetic energy by the heat coming from the campfire. The kinetic energy causes the air molecules to move faster and they impact the container walls more frequently and with more force. The increase in pressure inside may eventually exceed the strength of the can and it will explode. An additional factor is that the soup may begin boiling which will then aid even more gas and more pressure to the inside of the can.  and the situation: When studying the kinetic-molecular theory, two teams of students did and experiment. Team A heated a can of soup over the fire without venting it first, team B heated a can of soup, but vented it first.  Answer the following question: Which team had a higher likelihood of their can exploding? Answer:","output":"Team A had a higher likelihood of their can exploding due to the reasons explained by the kinetic-molecular theory. By heating the can of soup over the fire without venting it first, Team A created a closed system with no room for the expanding gas molecules to escape. As the heat from the campfire increased the kinetic energy of the air molecules inside the can, they moved faster and collided with the container walls more frequently and with greater force. This led to an increase in pressure inside the can. Additionally, the soup inside the can began to boil due to the increased heat, creating more gas and contributing to the pressure buildup inside the can. As the pressure continued to rise, it exceeded the strength of the can, leading to a higher likelihood of explosion. On the other hand, Team B vented their can of soup before heating it. By doing so, they allowed the expanding gas molecules and steam produced by the boiling soup to escape, thereby preventing a significant buildup of pressure inside the can. As a result, Team B's can had a lower risk of exploding compared to Team A's can. In conclusion, based on the kinetic-molecular theory and the given experimental conditions, Team A's unvented can of soup had a higher likelihood of exploding due to the accelerated molecular movement and pressure buildup within the closed container. Team B's vented can allowed for a release of pressure, which significantly reduced the chances of an explosion."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Here is an article: WASHINGTON—The Obama administration agreed to back the lifting of United Nations sanctions on two Iranian state banks blacklisted for financing Iran’s ballistic-missile program on the same day in January that Tehran released four American citizens from prison, according to U.S. officials and congressional staff briefed on the deliberations. The U.N. sanctions on the two banks weren’t initially to be lifted until 2023, under a landmark nuclear agreement between Iran and world powers that went into effect on Jan. 16. The U.N. Security Council’s delisting of the two banks, Bank Sepah and Bank Sepah International, was part of a package of tightly scripted agreements—the others were a controversial prisoner swap and transfer of 1.7 billion in cash to Iran—that were finalized between the U.S. and Iran on Jan. 17, the day the Americans were freed. The new details of the delisting have emerged after administration officials briefed lawmakers earlier this month on the U.S. decision. According to senior U.S. officials, a senior State Department official, Brett McGurk, and a representative of the Iranian government signed three documents in Geneva on the morning of Jan. 17. One document committed the U.S. to dropping criminal charges against 21 Iranian nationals, and Tehran to releasing the Americans imprisoned in Iran. Another committed the U.S. to immediately transfer 400 million in cash to the Iranian regime and arrange the delivery within weeks of two subsequent cash payments totaling 1.3 billion to settle a decades-old legal dispute over a failed arms deal. The U.S. agreed in a third document to support the immediate delisting of the two Iranian banks, according to senior U.S. officials. In the hours after the documents were signed at a Swiss hotel, the different elements of the agreement went forward: The Americans were released, Iran took possession of the 400 million in cash, and the U.N. Security Council removed sanctions on Bank Sepah and Bank Sepah International, these officials said. “Lifting the sanctions on Sepah was part of the package,” said a senior U.S. official briefed on the deliberations. “The timing of all this isn’t coincidental. Everything was linked to some degree.” A documentary published by Tasnim News Agency, an Iranian media outlet affiliated with the elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, claimed in February that Iranian government officials had demanded that Sepah be taken off the sanctions list as part of a deal to release the prisoners. The Obama administration, under the nuclear deal reached in July 2015, agreed to lift Treasury Department sanctions on Bank Sepah, but U.N. penalties were to remain in place for eight years. But after the nuclear deal was forged, U.S. officials said, there was a continued dialogue with Iran about the status of the two banks before the deal went into effect in January. Tehran argued that the banks were critical to the country’s economy and international trade. Bank Sepah is Iran’s oldest bank and one of its three largest in terms of assets. Bank Sepah International, based in London, was key to financing Iran’s international trade before sanctions were imposed. U.S. officials said there was a desire in Washington to harmonize the U.N. sanctions list with the U.S.’s. And they said Washington believed Iran had earned more sanctions relief because Tehran had been implementing the terms of the nuclear agreement, which called for a major scaling back of its infrastructure and production of nuclear fuel. “The issue of Bank Sepah has been one of many topics we discussed with Iran in our overall diplomatic discussions,” said a second senior administration official briefed on the deliberations. Another senior administration official said lifting sanctions on Bank Sepah and its London affiliate was in the spirit of the commitment by the U.S. and other world powers to provide Iran with sanctions relief. Administration critics and some congressional officials said they believed the move broke the commitments the administration made to Congress about the deal. The Obama administration had told Congress that under the deal the U.S. would lift sanctions only on companies and individuals tied to Iran’s nuclear development. Sanctions on those involved in missile development were to remain in place, these critics said. The Obama administration has repeatedly said it is committed to rolling back Iran’s ballistic missile program. “By agreeing to remove U.N. and EU sanctions eight years early on Iran’s main missile financing bank, the administration effectively greenlighted their nuclear warhead-capable ballistic missile program,” said Mark Dubowitz, a top critic of the Iran nuclear deal at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a Washington think tank. The U.S. Treasury Department sanctioned Bank Sepah, Bank Sepah International and its then-chairman in 2007 for their alleged role in backing Iran’s missile program. The designation didn’t mention what direct role the entities allegedly played in helping Iran’s nuclear program. At the time, the Treasury said that Bank Sepah and Bank Sepah International had provided financial support to Iranian-state owned companies and organizations developing Iran’s missile program. These included Iran’s Aerospace Industries Organization and the Shahid Hemmat Industries Group. “Bank Sepah is the financial linchpin of Iran’s missile procurement network and has actively assisted Iran’s pursuit of missiles capable of carrying weapons of mass destruction,” the Treasury said in a January 2007 statement. Iran has conducted up to 10 ballistic missile tests since the forging of the nuclear agreement in July 2015. The U.N. Security Council has condemned Tehran’s actions but hasn’t moved to impose any new sanctions on the country.In March, the Treasury Department imposed sanctions on two Iranian companies it said were working with Shahid Hemmat Industries. U.S. officials said the Obama administration closely vetted the activities of all individuals and entities tied to Bank Sepah before supporting the lifting of U.S. and U.N. sanctions. “We have the ability to quickly reimpose U.S. sanctions if Bank Sepah or any other entity engages in activities that remain sanctionable,” said the second senior U.S. official. The Obama administration’s decision to send such large amounts of cash to Iran has fueled charges in Congress that the White House paid ransom to Tehran to secure the release of the American prisoners. The White House has repeatedly denied the charge, saying the 1.7 billion settlement saved the U.S. as much as 8 billion that it could have owed Iran if it lost, as was expected, a court proceeding that was taking place in The Hague, Netherlands. The administration has said the cash was used as “leverage” to make sure the American prisoners were released. The dispute in Washington has only deepened in recent weeks, as senior Pentagon officials, including Secretary of Defense Ash Carter, told Congress in a hearing that they weren’t notified by the White House about the cash transfer. The chairman of the Joints Chief of Staff, Marine Gen. Joe Dunford, said at a hearing last week that he found it “troubling” that the U.S. provided Tehran with so much cash, which he argued could be used for “spreading malign influence.” Write to Jay Solomon at jay.solomon@wsj.com and Carol E.

The most widely accepted estimate for the Middle East, including Iraq, Iran and Syria, during this time, is for a death rate of about a third. The Black Death killed about 40% of Egypts population. Half of Pariss population of 100,000 people died. In Italy, the population of Florence was reduced from 110,000–120,000 inhabitants in 1338 down to 50,000 in 1351. At least 60% of the population of Hamburg and Bremen perished, and a similar percentage of Londoners may have died from the disease as well. In London approximately 62,000 people died between the years between 1346 and 1353.   While contemporary reports account of mass burial pits being created in response to the large numbers of dead, recent scientific investigations of a burial pit in Central London found well-preserved individuals to be buried in isolated, evenly spaced graves, suggesting at least some pre-planning and Christian burials at this time. Before 1350, there were about 170,000 settlements in Germany, and this was reduced by nearly 40,000 by 1450. In 1348, the plague spread so rapidly that before any physicians or government authorities had time to reflect upon its origins, about a third of the European population had already perished. In crowded cities, it was not uncommon for as much as 50% of the population to die. The disease bypassed some areas, and the most isolated areas were less vulnerable to contagion.

Answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What was the debut album of the band that took its name from a fictional Phoenician city?  Opeth was formed as a death metal band in 1989 in Stockholm, Sweden, by lead vocalist David Isberg. Isberg asked former Eruption band member Mikael Åkerfeldt, who was just 16 years old at the time, to join Opeth as a bassist. When Åkerfeldt showed up to practice on the day after Isberg invited him, it became clear that Isberg had not told the band members, including the band's current bassist, that Åkerfeldt would be joining the band. An ensuing argument led to all members but Isberg and Åkerfeldt leaving to form a new project. The band name was derived from the word \\"Opet\\", taken from the Wilbur Smith novel The Sunbird. In this novel, Opet is the name of a fictional Phoenician city in South Africa translated as \\"City of the Moon\\". Isberg and Åkerfeldt recruited drummer Anders Nordin, bassist Nick Döring, and guitarist Andreas Dimeo. Unsatisfied with Opeth's slow progress, Döring and Dimeo left the band after their first performance, and were replaced by guitarist Kim Pettersson and bassist Johan De Farfalla. After the next show, De Farfalla left Opeth to spend time with his girlfriend in Germany, and was initially replaced by Mattias Ander, before Åkerfeldt's friend Peter Lindgren took on the role of bassist. Rhythm guitarist Kim Pettersson left following the band's next performance, and Lindgren switched to guitar, with the role of bassist falling to Stefan Guteklint. The following year, David Isberg left the band citing \\"creative differences\\".Following Isberg's departure, Åkerfeldt took over vocal duties and he, Lindgren, and Nordin spent the next year writing and rehearsing new material. The group began to rely less on the blast beats and aggression typical of death metal, and incorporated acoustic guitars and guitar harmonies into their music; developing the core sound of Opeth. Bassist Guteklint was dismissed by the band after they signed their first record deal with Candlelight Records in 1994. Opeth initially employed former member De Farfalla as a session bassist for their demo recordings, and he...

So far, the campaign has raised almost 4,000 for the 'Shining' actress.      Stanley Kubrick's daughter is spearheading an effort to raise funds for ailing actress Shelley Duvall, who starred in her father's iconic film The Shining.      Vivian Kubrick began raising funds on Friday for Duvall after it was announced the 67-year-old, who now lives in Texas, was going to appear on a Friday episode of Dr. Phil.      \\"I just think she deserves a great deal more respect,\\" Kubrick told The Hollywood Reporter. \\"I am just trying to collect as much money as I can.\\"      Kubrick, who noted she did not know whether Duvall was receiving government benefits, told THR she would first seek professional financial advice before distributing the funds to Duvall in order to protect any current benefits she may depend on. A simple trust fund may be a good solution, she added.      \\"I think more and more people now realize how brutal the Hollywood system is and how people aren't really taken care of even though the studio system has benefited greatly from their talent,\\" Kubrick told THR. \\"And I know many of them make a lot of money, but like with any artist, the money is not something that just keeps pouring in. And if you aren't blessed with business sense, you might not have held onto the money.\\"      Kubrick also noted that she hopes to secure Duvall health insurance through the Screen Actors Guild, if it is possible.      Duvall, who has been out of the public eye for more than a decade, seems to be suffering from mental health issues. For instance, she told the show's host, Phil McGraw, that she believes her Popeye co-star, the late Robin Williams, is still alive, just a shape-shifter.      Duvall was also worried that any doctors she might visit at the behest of McGraw might try to kill her.      On Thursday, Kubrick, who has not seen Duvall since her father wrapped production on The Shining, blasted McGraw for, in her opinion, exploiting the former actress and called for a boycott of the episode. On Friday, she launched a GoFundMe page for Duvall.      \\"[My father] was absolutely thrilled with her performance, I know that much,\\" Kubrick laments about Duvall. \\"He said she was a fantastic Wendy Torrance, and she was. She was beautifully vulnerable and kooky and someone you might believe would stay with a Jack Torrance character.\\"      So far, Kubrick's campaign for Duvall has raised more than 4,000.      And Kubrick was not alone in her disgust at McGraw's segment.      Mia Farrow and her son, journalist Ronan, also criticized the show for taking advantage of someone ill for ratings.

When you're talking to the girl you like, you want to make her feel special. People like it when others take an interest in them and the girl you like is no different. Showing that you care about her thoughts will make her more interested in you, as a result.  Ask her opinion on things, even if it's something silly. For example: say you're wearing a shirt that your friend doesn't like, ask for her opinion on whether the shirt is silly or not. Tell her she's the final judge. It'll make her laugh and feel important. Pay attention to the things that she does and says, so you can ask questions about it. For example, if she mentions going rock climbing, ask her how she got started rock climbing and what she enjoys about it. People like talking about themselves, so before you jump in with stories of your own, ask her another question about what she thinks. In this day and age people have really lost the skill of listening (Really listening) to one another. Real listening is when you take the time to absorb what someone is saying rather than thinking about the next thing you're going to say or what you're going to have for dinner.  For example: even if you're at a loud party, when you're having a conversation with her, maintain eye contact, ask questions and if your mind strays, ask for clarification (you can use the loud party as an excuse: \\"Sorry, it's really loud in here.

This doesn't mean that you need to be the class clown (Actually, it will probably work best if you aren't). All this means is that you make her laugh and say a few entertaining things. Now, everyone has a different sense of humor and you know her best, but if you're not sure there are a few things to do that rarely fail.  Gently poke fun at yourself. You don't have to do a big self-deprecating speech (in fact that will make you seem not confident), but a few jabs at yourself will get her laughing and show that you don't take yourself too seriously. For example: talk about how you got hit in the head with a soccer ball that day when you weren't paying attention, or that time you went to the wrong class because you forgot what day it was. Bring up something funny that you saw that day (or within the previous week). It should be something a little out of the ordinary and funny. For example: ask her if she's ever ended up entangled with a bunch of zombies and then tell her about the zombie walk you accidentally ended up in the middle of. Flirting can be very hit or miss and is to be used with caution. Since everyone is different, there is no one-size-fits-all approach to flirting with someone. Humor and eye contact are the two big ones, but you can subtly flirt in other ways.  Unless she's made it explicitly clear, flirting really obviously can be off-putting to some girls. Keep that in mind when you're hanging out with her. If you aren't a good flirt, eye contact and humor will probably be your best bets. Flirting over text, however, can be a great, non-threatening type of flirting. Of course, you want this to be only supplementary to your interactions in person. Keep texts short, sometimes a picture is worth more than a hundred words (especially a funny picture; do NOT send explicit pictures unless she has actually asked for them!). It's good to have a reason to text. You could say something like \\"saw this and thought of you\\" (and then send a picture). Giving her the right compliment can be a great way of expressing interest and flirting. Don't do something basic like \\"you're the most beautiful girl I've ever met\\" (it comes across as insincere). Instead, say something like \\"Did you realize your sweater matches your eyes? it's a beautiful color,\\" or \\"of course you aced that test, you're super smart!\\" In the end, the best way to act around the girl you like is to tell her how you feel. She might otherwise never know. It can seem super intimidating or scary to bare your feelings like that (and it is a very brave act!). But, otherwise you both will be in this uncomfortable holding pattern.  Don't do it in front of everyone. Choose a time and place where you're both sober and in your right mind. Simply say \\"Hey, I really like you and I was wondering if you'd like to go on a date sometime.\\" Don't do this over the phone or text or social media, because you will come across as a coward and most girl's don't find that a particularly attractive quality. Respect her decision, even if she says \\"no.\\" It can hurt when someone says no, but remember that it isn't about you as a person, it's simply that your proposal didn't work for her (because she isn't interested, or because she already has a boyfriend, or she's into girls, etc.). You can ask why if you must, but if she simply says \\"Because I'm not interested\\" that's your answer and leave it at that. If she says \\"yes,\\" then yay! Now you two can get to planning a super fun first date. The relationship might not work out, but you proved your bravery by asking her out and your worth by treating her with respect. Summary:","output":"To create a connection with the girl you like, show genuine interest in her thoughts and opinions, listen attentively, make her laugh, use humor and subtle flirting, and be brave enough to express your feelings while respecting her decision."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It has a strong focus on the mutual development of intellect and character. Stated core values are learning, service and leadership. Eureka offers a classical liberal arts education with an array of requirements that are designed to create well-rounded, critical thinking leaders. Popular majors include education, business, history, political science, communication, and the fine and performing arts. Enrollment in 201011 was about 785 students. Dr. David J. Arnold resigned in 2016. Dr. Jamal Santa Cruz Wright is currently serving as Interim President of Eureka College.  - A liberal arts college is a college with an emphasis on undergraduate study in the liberal arts and sciences. A liberal arts college aims to impart a broad general knowledge and develop general intellectual capacities, in contrast to a professional, vocational, or technical curriculum. Students in a liberal arts college generally major in a particular discipline while receiving exposure to a wide range of academic subjects, including sciences as well as the traditional humanities subjects taught as liberal arts. Although it draws on European antecedents, the liberal arts college is strongly associated with American higher education, and most liberal arts colleges around the world draw explicitly on the American model.  - Illinois is a state in the midwestern region of the United States, achieving statehood in 1818. It is the 5th most populous state and 25th largest state in terms of land area, and is often noted as a microcosm of the entire country. The word \\"Illinois\\" comes from the Algonquin word for \\"tribe of superior men\\". With Chicago in the northeast, small industrial cities and great agricultural productivity in central and northern Illinois, and natural resources like coal, timber, and petroleum in the south, Illinois has a diverse economic base and is a major transportation hub. The Port of Chicago connects the state to other global ports from the Great Lakes, via the Saint Lawrence Seaway, to the Atlantic Ocean, as well as the Great Lakes to the Mississippi River, via the Illinois River. For decades, O'Hare International Airport has been ranked as one of the world's busiest airports. Illinois has long had a reputation as a bellwether both in social and cultural terms and politics.  - Abingdon College was a college in Abingdon , Illinois . It opened in 1853 and was consolidated with Eureka College in the 1880s . Abingdon College was founded by P. H. Murphy and J. C. Reynolds , and opened on the first Monday of April in 1853 . It received a charter from the state of Illinois in February 1855 . Between 1875 and 1877 , however , a quarrel between groups involved in the college effectively closed it . F. M. Bruner bought the college in 1880 , but in 1885 , it merged with Eureka College , and the Abingdon campus closed in 1888 . After consolidating with Eureka College and closing , the remnants of Abingdon College were bought by a professor named Summers , who named the facility Abingdon College Normal , but this college quickly failed as well . After this , another college in Abingdon , Hedding College , which had been founded about 2 years after Abingdon College , bought the property in 1895 and used the buildings as their music and normal school campus .  - A mousetrap is a specialised type of animal trap designed primarily to catch mice; however, it may also (intentionally or unintentionally) trap other small animals. Mousetraps are usually set in an indoor location where there is a suspected infestation of rodents. Larger traps are designed to catch other species of animals; such as rats, squirrels, other small rodents, or other animals.  - A census is the procedure of systematically acquiring and recording information about the members of a given population. It is a regularly occurring and official count of a particular population. The term is used mostly in connection with national population and housing censuses; other common censuses include agriculture, business, and traffic censuses. The United Nations defines the essential features of population and housing censuses as \\"individual enumeration, universality within a defined territory, simultaneity and defined periodicity\\", and recommends that population censuses be taken at least every 10 years. United Nations recommendations also cover census topics to be collected, official definitions, classifications and other useful information to co-ordinate international practice.  - Abingdon is a city in Knox County, Illinois, 50 miles (80 km) west of Peoria. It is part of the Galesburg Micropolitan Statistical Area. The city was first settled in 1828 and was incorporated in 1857. In 1894, the patent for the common spring-loaded mousetrap was awarded to William Hooker of Abingdon. In 1890, 1,321 people lived here; in 1900, 2,022; and in 1910, 2,464. The population was 3,612 at the 2000 census.  - Eureka is a city in Olio Township, Woodford County, Illinois, United States. The population was 5,295 at the 2010 census.

After the party, Lovell, who had orbited the Moon on Apollo 8, tells his wife Marilyn that he intends to return to the Moon and walk on its surface. On October 30, 1969, as Lovell conducts a VIP tour of NASA's Vehicle Assembly Building, his boss Deke Slayton informs him that he and his crew will fly the Apollo 13 mission instead of Apollo 14. Lovell, Ken Mattingly, and Fred Haise train for their new mission. Days before launch, Mattingly is discovered to have been exposed to rubella, and the flight surgeon demands his replacement with Mattingly's backup, Jack Swigert, as a safety precaution. Lovell initially resists breaking up his team, but relents when Slayton threatens to bump his crew to a later mission. As the launch date approaches, Marilyn has a nightmare about her husband's safety, but goes to the Kennedy Space Center the night before launch to see him off. On April 11, 1970, Apollo 13 Flight Director Gene Kranz gives the go-ahead from Houston's Mission Control Center for launch. After the Saturn V rocket climbs through the atmosphere, an engine on the second stage cuts off prematurely, but the craft still reaches its Earth parking orbit. After the third stage re-fires, sending Apollo 13 to the Moon, Swigert docks the Command/Service Module Odyssey with the Lunar Module Aquarius and pulls it away from the spent stage. Three days into the mission, the crew sends a live television transmission from Odyssey, which the networks decline to broadcast live. After Swigert performs a standard housekeeping procedure, one of two liquid oxygen tanks explodes, emptying its contents into space and sending the craft tumbling.

Question: Thor locks Elle an Stella out of the ship knowing that they will do what? Movie title: Starcrash Movie plot: In the distant future, a starship with an \\"important passenger\\" tries to find the base of the ruthless Count Zarth Arn, when the ship attacked by a mysterious weapon which red globs of energy enter the ship and drive the crew to madness, killing each other off.Meanwhile, in another part of the galaxy, space outlaw and smuggler Stella Star (Caroline Munroe) and her companion Akton (Marjor Gortner), are on a smuggling run when they run into the Imperial Space Police led by the space robot 'L' (or Elle in a more formal tile). After a spaceship chase sequence, Akton and Stella escape from their pursuers by jumping into hyperspace, a faster-than-light travel. They happen to find one of the escape pods from the starship in the opening scene, and find one still-alive survivor. But shortly afterwards, they are finally apprehended by the police who have also followed their hyperspace travel route.Tried, convicted and found guilty of piracy, both Akton and Stella are sentenced to life in prison. A few days later, on a prison colony, Stella manages to create a diversion and escape. But she is found by the chief-of-police Thor (Robert Tessier) who takes her to a orbiting main ship where she is reunited with Akton. It is here that they are contacted by the Emperor of the Galaxy (Christopher Plummer) via a hologram, who thanks them for the discovery of the survivor of the starship and they are granted clemency to help find one of three missing escape pods from the ship which contain the Emperor's son. The Emperor is in feud with the rouge Count Zarth Arn (Joe Spinell) who has hidden a secret weapon on a remote planet and will use it to overthrow him and take over the galaxy for himself and his legion of evil warriors. With Chief Thor and the robot Elle accompanying them, the Emperor tells Stella and Akton to find the Count's secret weapon as well as rescue his son who may be still alive.

Please answer the following question: Article: A new study has found that it may be possible to train people to be more intelligent, increasing the brainpower they had at birth. Until now,it has been widely assumed that the kind of mental ability that allows us to solve new problems without having any relevant previous experience--what psychologists call fluid intelligence--is innate and cannot be taught(though people can raise their grades on tests of it by practicing). But in the new study,researchers describe a method for improving this skill,along with experiments to prove it works. The key, researchers found, was carefully structured training in working memory--the kind that allows memorization of a telephone number just long enough to dial it.This type of memory is closely related to fluid intelligence,so the researchers reasoned that improving it might lead to improvements in fluid intelligence. First they measured fluid intelligence of volunteers using standard tests.Then they trained each in a complicated memory task--the child's card game,in which they had to recall a card they saw and heard.During the course, they needed to ignore irrelevant items, monitor ongoing performance,manage two tasks at the same time and connect related items to one another in space and time. The four groups experienced a half-hour of training daily for 8, 12, 17 and 19 days, respectively.To make sure they were not just improving their test-taking skills,the researchers compared them with control groups that took the tests without the training. The results, published Monday in The Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences,were striking.Improvement in the trained groups was a lot greater.Moreover,the longer they trained, the higher their scores were.All performers,from the weakest to the strongest,showed significant improvement. \\"Our results show you can increase your intelligence with proper training.\\" said Dr Jaeggi, a co-author of the paper.\\"No one knows how long the gains will last after training stops,\\" he added, \\"and the experiment's design did not allow the...

Watched the videos, read the excellent reviews, etc. Still can't get the thing to stay cocked-just releases itself before you can even get to the safety latch. Never even got close to putting them in the ground-I bought 3 of them and now I get to pay the shipping back. By the time I box them up, take them to shipping just to get the remainder of my money back-might as well just throw them away and save the aggravation. Go for it if you feel lucky. Does this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment? Answer:","output":"The product review conveys a negative sentiment. The reviewer seems to be deeply dissatisfied and frustrated with the product. It doesn't meet his/her expectations and was unable to function properly, according to the user's experience. Firstly, the user referred to the product as 'terrible', which implies an overall negative impression. The reviewer also mentioned having struggled with the product for three days, which indicates that the product is not user-friendly or straightforward to operate. The reviewer even mentioned attempts to understand the functionality of the product better by referring to videos and reading other reviews but to no avail, expressing that the product does not work as advertised.  Secondly, the user's frustration is evident in the fact that the product seems to be malfunctioning, it 'can't stay cocked' and 'releases itself' before the safety latch comes on. Also, the buyer was unable to install them, as indicated by the phrase 'Never even got close to putting them in the ground'. This speaks volumes about the product's significant performance problems, according to this customer's experiences. Thirdly, buying a total of three units of the product and experiencing the failings in all of them suggests a consistent problem with the product's quality or design, furthering the negative sentiment.  Lastly, the agony of needing to pay for the return shipping is another pain point for the reviewer. They commented that the effort and cost involved in returning the products might not be worth the refund, which implies not just a disappointing product but an inconvenient and costly overall customer experience. The concluding remark 'Go for it if you feel lucky' is a sarcastic comment and distinctly negative, suggesting that purchasing this product is a gamble and that other potential buyers may not want to take the risk. This sarcastic tone heightens the negativity of the review, emphasizing the reviewer's dissatisfaction. Therefore, based on these observations, it is clear that the given review carries a negative sentiment about the product."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Definition: In this task, you will be shown a prompt from a judicial decision and multiple holding statements derived from citations following text in a legal decision.  Holdings represent the governing legal rule when the law is applied to a particular set of facts. There are five answer choices for each citing text. The correct answer is the holding statement that corresponds to the citing text. You should write an incorrect option. Even though there exist multiple wrong answers, we only need a single wrong answer. There is a <HOLDING> token in the position of the citing text prompt where the holding statement was extracted. Input: & Health Review Comm’n, 649 F.2d 1160, 1165 (5th Cir. Unit B July 9, 1981)). As for the knowledge element (the one at issue in this case), the Secretary can prove employer knowledge of the violation in one of two ways. First, where the Secretary shows that a supervisor had either actual or constructive knowledge of the violation, such knowledge is generally-imputed to the employer. See Georgia Elec. Co. v. Marshall, 595 F.2d 309, 321 (5th Cir.1979); New York State Elec. & Gas Corp., 88 F.3d at 105; see also Secretary of Labor v. Access Equip. Sys., Inc., 18 O.S.H. Cas. (BNA) 1718, at *9 (1999). An example of actual knowledge is where a supervisor directly sees a subordinate’s misconduct. See, e.g., Secretary of Labor v. Kansas Power & Light Co., 5 O.S.H. Cas. (BNA) 1202, at *3 (1977) (<HOLDING>). An example of constructive knowledge is where   Holding statements: (A) holding that because the supervisor directly saw the violative conduct without stating any objection his knowledge and approval of the work methods employed will be imputed to respondent (B) holding that the use of the word or in a statute indicates that any of the listed alternative methods will suffice (C) holding that the foundational prerequisites are unnecessary where the test result is admitted in evidence without objection when evidence of one of the issues in the case is admitted without objection the party against whom it is offered waives any objection to the evidence and it may be properly considered even if the evidence would have been excluded upon a proper objection (D) holding that to preserve an alleged error in the admission of evidence a timely objection must be made to the introduction of the evidence specific grounds for the objection should be stated and a ruling on the objection must be made by the trial court (E) holding that constructive knowledge was shown where the supervisor who had just walked into the work area was 10 feet away from the violative conduct Output:","output":"(B) holding that the use of the word or in a statute indicates that any of the listed alternative methods will suffice"},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer:","output":"In order to provide a comprehensive and detailed validation of the suggested answer, we will first break down the original question and the suggested answer, and then analyze if the provided information is sufficient, accurate, and appropriate. Original Question: What are web related servers? Based on the question, it seems that you are asking for an explanation or a description of servers that play a role in web-based processes or host web applications. Suggested Answer: Multiple web servers may be used for a high traffic website, here four Sun Fire X4200 servers are installed together. The suggested answer addresses the fact that multiple web servers can be employed for high-traffic websites, and it provides a specific example of four Sun Fire X4200 servers being used in such a scenario. However, the suggested answer fails to provide an adequate explanation or description of what web-related servers are, as requested by the original question.  A more suitable and detailed answer to the original question would be: Web-related servers are computing systems designed to handle requests, process data, and deliver web content (such as web pages and applications) to clients via the internet or internal networks. Web-related servers can be broadly categorized into several types, including: 1. Web server: A web server is specifically designed to host websites and provide requested web pages or files to clients via the HTTP or HTTPS protocols. Examples of web server software include Apache HTTP Server, Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS), and NGINX. 2. Application server: An application server hosts and runs web applications, providing business logic and computational resources necessary for web-based application execution. This server type often handles tasks like data validation and database communication. Examples include WildFly, GlassFish, and IBM WebSphere. 3. File server: A file server stores and manages files, making them accessible to clients over a network. File servers facilitate remote access, sharing, and secure data storage. Examples include Network Attached Storage (NAS) devices or File Transfer Protocol (FTP) servers. 4. Database server: A database server retrieves, stores, and manages data for web-based applications housed in relational or non-relational databases. Popular database servers include Microsoft SQL Server, Oracle Database, and MySQL. 5. Proxy server: A proxy server sits between clients and other servers, acting as an intermediary to optimize performance and provide security features. Proxy servers can help with load distribution, caching, and monitoring resources, while also mitigating the risk of potential cyberattacks. In conclusion, while the suggested answer provides a specific example of utilizing multiple web servers for a high traffic website, it fails to address the original question about what web-related servers are. The aforementioned detailed answer should provide a more comprehensive and informative response to the original query."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Red ribbons are tied at each end. a scissor","output":"Based on the provided information and context, the most logical next event would be for someone to use the scissors to carefully cut the tape and ribbon, in order to unwrap the gift and reveal its contents. Here is a detailed and long answer outlining how this event may unfold: 1. Preparing to unwrap the gift: The person who is about to unwrap the gift should make sure they have enough space on a table, floor, or any flat surface. This allows them to comfortably unwrap the gift without damaging the contents. They may also grab a small trash bag or designated container to dispose of the wrapping materials, keeping the workspace tidy as they proceed. 2. Cutting the tape: The individual would then hold the scissors with one hand, making sure that they have a firm and comfortable grip on the scissors. Using a pair of scissors with a pointed tip is useful for greater precision when cutting the tape. They would carefully slide the tip of the scissors under the tape, making sure not to puncture the wrapping paper or the gift inside. Once the scissors are in place, they can then apply gentle pressure to cut the tape without tearing the wrapping paper. 3. Cutting the ribbons: Having successfully cut the tape, the person would now move on to cutting the red ribbons on both ends. They can use their other hand to steady the ribbon, holding it in place so it doesn't move as they cut. The person should take care not to accidentally cut too close to the gift inside, as this could damage the contents. Once the ribbons have been cut, they can be removed and placed in the designated disposal container.  4. Removing the clear plastic: With the tape and ribbons out of the way, it is now time to remove the clear plastic that surrounds the gift. The person should gently lift the plastic from one corner, being mindful not to damage the gift or the wrapping paper underneath. They can then delicately peel the plastic away, repeating this process for each remaining corner. Once the plastic has been fully removed, it should also be placed in the designated disposal container.  5. Unwrapping the gift: With the clear plastic, tape, and ribbons removed, the person can now proceed to unwrap the gift. They should gently lift the edges of the wrapping paper and pull them away from the gift. If the paper is taped to the gift itself, they can use the scissors to carefully cut this tape as well. As the wrapping paper is removed, the person should continue to be gentle in order to preserve the gift inside. 6. Revealing the contents: Once the wrapping paper has been completely removed, the gift will be revealed. The person who unwrapped the gift can now take a moment to appreciate the contents before properly disposing of all the wrapping materials and cleaning up the workspace. This step-by-step process outlines the most logical next event following the given scenario – unwrapping the gift-wrapped present using a scissor."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Scientifically known as Brassica rapa subsp. pekinensis or Brassica rapa Pekinensis Group, this type of Chinese cabbage has its origins near the Beijing region of China. It plays a prominent role in East Asian cuisine and has gained popularity in various parts of the world, including Europe, America, and Australia since the 20th century. According to the text, in many parts of the world, Napa cabbage is known as \\"Chinese cabbage.\\" The term \\"Chinese cabbage\\" is used since it can be easily distinguished from the regular cabbage that we are familiar with, which belongs to the Brassica oleracea species. Furthermore, the text indicates that in Australia, Napa cabbage is referred to as \\"wombok.\\" Napa cabbage is characterized by its elongated shape, crinkly pale green leaves, tender white stalks, and mild flavor. Its versatility makes it suitable for a wide range of culinary uses, ranging from raw consumption in salads to cooked preparations such as stir-fries, soups, and pickling. A well-known example of Napa cabbage usage is in the traditional Korean side dish called kimchi, where the vegetable is salted, seasoned, and fermented. In summary, based on the information given in the text, it can be concluded that Chinese cabbage and Napa cabbage are indeed the same. The different names used across the globe — such as \\"Chinese cabbage\\" and \\"wombok\\" — serve as an interesting reflection of the vegetable's prevalence in various cultures and cuisines.
