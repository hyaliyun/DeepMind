Now, a study has found that while this is certainly true, men also have to deal with the fact that they are also more stupid than the fairer sex. In the study, scientists measured the IQ of 2500 brothers and sisters and they found an uneven number of men not only in the top two percent, but also in the bottom two percent. The study's participants were tested on science, maths, English and mechanical abilities. Though there were twice as many men as women in the smartest group, there were also twice as many men among the bottom. The aggregate scores of men and women were similar. One of the study's authors, psychology professor Timothy Bates, said that the phenomenon may be because men have always been expected to be high achievers and women have been restricted to spend more time taking care of their homes. \\"The female developmental program may be tilted more towards ensuring survival and the safety of the middle ground.,\\" the Daily Mail quoted Professor Bates, of Edinburgh University, as saying. The research _ past results that men were more likely than women to receive first class University degrees or thirds and women secured the seconds. It has been said that men are more ready to take risk when it comes to academics. Women have always found to be steadier in their learning. A past study has shown that women are securing more firsts and seconds, while men are continuing to receive more thirds. The argument for the change is that the increase of coursework at the cost of exams favors women's steady approach.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Obama Taps Geithner to Head Treasury, Prepares Economic Team for Roll-Out Next Week From Jake Tapper and George Stephanopoulos: After a very fluid process in which the identity of President-elect Obama’s leading candidate for the job seemed to fluctuate like the market, on Friday New York Federal Reserve President Timothy Geithner emerged poised to become the next Secretary of the Treasury. Mr. Obama intends to announce his nomination early next week. As one of the government’s point people dealing with Wall Street, Geithner has earned much respect from politicians and CEOs alike. He has been working closely with the current Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke. As evidence of Geithner’s popularity on Wall Street, when the news leaked to two prominent business media — CNBC and the Wall Street Journal — the Dow Jones Industrial Average soared almost 500 points. Geithner, a registered independent, has long been respected in Obamaland, referred to as \\"Obama-esque\\" for his outside-the-box thinking, relative youth, his overseas upbringing (elementary school in New Delhi, high school in Bangkok) and his love of a good game of pickup basketball. The only other serious candidate for the Treasury slot has been the man who served that role at the end of the Clinton administration, Larry Summers. The formidable Summers is a man of great intellect but also controversy — he was forced out as president of Harvard for any number of perceived slights, including suggesting that females are innately inferior in engineering and math. Obama has been encouraging Summers to serve in his administration in some other role, perhaps as chair of the National Economic Council. Some Democrats suggest that Obama plans to name Summers chairman of the Federal Reserve when Bernanke’s term expires at the beginning of 2010. If for some reason Summers does not go to NEC, the leading candidate is Jack Lew, currently the Chief Operating Officer of Citigroup’s Alternative Investments unit. Lew served as director of the Office of Management and Budget for President Bill Clinton. He and Dan Tarullo, a former Assistant Secretary of State for Economic and Business Affairs under Clinton — who was earlier this week named leader of the Obama Transition Team’s Economic Policy Working Group — may both end up working at NEC. Peter Orszag, the director of the Congressional Budget Office, will become Obama’s OMB director. New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson is a strong contender to be Obama’s Secretary of Commerce. Some high profile women are being considered for key economic slots. Laura D’Andrea Tyson, the former chair of President Clinton’s Council of Economic Advisers, and could also play a key role in the Obama administration. The question right now — what job to give her? Would deputy Treasury Secretary be enough to lure her east from the San Francisco area, where she’s a professor at the Haas School of Business of the University of California, Berkeley. Interestingly, though it’s unclear what the Obama Team will decide, there is a lot of support among Democrats on Capitol Hill for Sheila Bair, the Republican chairwoman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., to stay on board. In addition to wanting the best team he can put together, the Transition Team’s goal is to assemble a group that can work well together, with as few confirmation issues as possible. – Jake Tapper and George Stephanopoulos Summary:","output":"President-elect Obama has chosen New York Federal Reserve President Timothy Geithner as the next Secretary of the Treasury, with plans to announce his nomination early next week.

(CNN) -- Three people have been charged in last year's theft of the famous \\"Arbeit Macht Frei\\" sign at the Auschwitz concentration camp in Poland, a prosecutor said Friday.  The prosecutor, Robert Parys, said he could not immediately confirm details about those charged, but Poland's official PAP news agency reported the main suspect is a Swedish man, Anders Hoegstroem.  Prosecutors say Hoegstroem incited two Poles to steal the sign, which sat atop the entrance to the camp, PAP reported. He pleaded not guilty, and would face a sentence of 10 years in prison if convicted, the news agency reported.  Hoegstroem was arrested in February in Stockholm, Sweden, and the Swedish court allowed him to be transferred to Poland in April, PAP said.  The sign reading \\"Arbeit Macht Frei\\" -- German for \\"Work Sets You Free\\" -- was emblematic of the Nazi camps of World War II. It was stolen in December of last year, prompting outrage around the world.  The sign was found 70 hours later in a village near Torun, roughly 210 miles (340 kilometers) to the north, and had been chopped into three parts, PAP reported.  The men managed to remove the heavy iron sign by unscrewing it from one side and pulling off on the other, police spokeswoman Agnieszka Szczygiel said at the time.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Please briefly summarize this news article: Texas Is Pressed to Spare Mexican Citizen on Death Row In another sense, though, Mr. Leal’s case is different from those of the six men Texas has already put to death this year. He is a citizen of Mexico. After his arrest, he was denied his rights under the Vienna Convention to consult Mexican consular officials. Had his government been allowed to come to his aid, Mr. Leal’s lawyers say, he might still have been convicted. But they say that legal help from the Mexican government would almost certainly have kept him off death row. Former judges, law enforcement officials, military leaders and diplomats have lined up on Mr. Leal’s side. Most take no position on Mr. Leal’s guilt or on the death penalty. Their argument is more practical. “If we do not comply with our obligations under the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations and the U.N. Charter,” said John B. Bellinger III, who was the State Department’s top lawyer in the administration of President George W. Bush, “we put at risk Americans, including Texans, who travel and may be arrested overseas. It is surprising that Texas does not recognize the risks it may be creating for its own citizens.” True, Texas provided Mr. Leal with a lawyer. But the convention requires that arrested foreigners also be told of their right to speak with consular officials and to be put in contact with them “without delay.” Billy Hayes, whose ordeal in a Turkish prison was the subject of the movie “Midnight Express,” wrote a letter to Gov. Rick Perry this month urging him to grant a reprieve to Mr. Leal. In an interview last week, Mr. Hayes said he could not have imagined negotiating the Turkish legal system without the emotional support and logistical help that American diplomats provided. “It’s a different country,” he said, “different language, different law and different rules.” Mr. Leal, by contrast, did not learn of his rights until two years after his conviction, and even then not from American authorities but from a fellow inmate. In 2004, the International Court of Justice in The Hague ruled for Mr. Leal and other Mexican inmates on death row in the United States, saying that American courts must grant “review and reconsideration” to claims that their cases had been hurt by the failure of the local authorities to allow them to contact consular officials. In 2005, Mr. Bush told state officials that they must comply with the international court’s decision. Mr. Bush’s memorandum puzzled officials in Texas, who said it seemed inconsistent with the Bush administration’s general hostility to international institutions and its support for the death penalty. Texas refused to go along, and in 2008 the Supreme Court said two things about that. One was that the United States was obligated to comply with the international tribunal’s judgment. The other was that the president alone could not by himself force states to go along; Congress had to act, too. Such legislation was submitted in the Senate this month. Its prospects are unclear, but it certainly won’t be enacted by July 7, when Mr. Leal is scheduled to die. Mr. Leal’s lawyers asked Judge Orlando L. Garcia of Federal District Court in San Antonio to stay the execution. Sandra L. Babcock, one of Mr. Leal’s lawyers, explained the legal theory behind the request. “He has a due process right,” she said of her client, “to remain alive while Congress has a meaningful opportunity to consider and pass this legislation.” Judge Garcia rejected the request on Wednesday. “The filing of a legislative proposal in the form of a bill is of no legal consequence,” he wrote. Mr. Leal has also asked the governor for a reprieve. Mr. Perry’s press secretary, Katherine Cesinger, suggested that he did not view the matter through the lens of reciprocal international obligations. “If you commit the most heinous of crimes in Texas,” she said, “you can expect to face the ultimate penalty under our laws, as in this case.” There is substantial evidence, including statements from Mr. Leal, that he was involved in the gruesome 1994 killing of Adria Sauceda, 16. Mr. Leal’s lawyers concede that “the argument that Mr. Leal was responsible for Ms. Sauceda’s death was at least plausible.” But they say prosecutors transformed what should have been at most a manslaughter charge into one for capital murder by saying Mr. Leal had kidnapped and raped Ms. Sauceda. “For this,” the lawyers wrote in their brief seeking a stay, “the state built its case on junk science, willful ignorance and profoundly problematic DNA evidence.” Mr. Leal’s court-appointed lawyer failed to investigate or challenge questionable evidence, and he did not present information about Mr. Leal’s background that might have supported a plea for leniency. Would a better lawyer retained by the Mexican government have made a difference? Maybe. Or maybe the right question is the one posed years ago by Donald F. Donovan, a New York lawyer who represented the Mexican government in The Hague. “If you were arrested in Damascus and they gave you a dime,” he asked, “would you want to call your court-appointed lawyer or the American Embassy?” Summary:","output":"A man from Mexico, named Mr. Leal, is in trouble in Texas. You see, he might get a very big punishment called the \\"death penalty\\", which means he could be put to death because of a very, very bad crime he did. But many people are upset because they believe he was not treated fairly.  Normally, when someone from another country gets in trouble in the US, they have a right to speak to the officials of their own country for help. This is called the Vienna Convention. But Mr. Leal wasn't told about this right until two years after he was caught.  Some big judges and leaders, and even a man who was in a movie called Billy Hayes, argue that it's very important to follow these rules clearly, otherwise other countries might not let Americans get help from their officials when they are in trouble in those countries.  Many years ago, an international court in The Hague, which is like a big, worldwide courtroom, said Mr. Leal's case was not treated fairly because he wasn't given his right to speak to Mexican officials. They asked the American courts to relook at Mr. Leal's case. But Texas did not agree to this, and now Mr. Leal's life is in danger as he might get the death penalty soon.  His lawyers tried to stop this from happening, but their request was denied. They say Mr. Leal did do something very bad, but not bad enough to get the death penalty. They think this happened because he did not get a good enough lawyer, but we can't say for sure if things would have turned out differently if he had had help from his own country."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Specific demand: In the first sentence, the protesters are demanding \\"greater autonomy,\\" which seems to be a political request focused on governance or control. In the second sentence, the demand is for \\"the regime's ouster,\\" which is a call for removing the current leadership. While both demands are political, they target different aspects of the political situation.

Use this fact to answer the question: refraction is when light bends An example of refraction is Pick your answer from: [I] The light that comes from the TV; [II] The light from a fire; [III] Turning the light on; [IV] Pickles seemingly bigger in the jar; The answer is:","output":"The answer is [IV] Pickles seemingly bigger in the jar. Refraction is the phenomenon that occurs when light passes through different mediums, causing it to change direction or bend. This happens because the speed of light varies in different substances, and as light moves from one medium to another, its speed changes, resulting in a change in direction. In the case of pickles in a jar, the jar is filled with a liquid (usually a mixture of vinegar, water, and salt). When light travels from the air outside the jar through the glass and then through the liquid, it experiences different mediums with varying refractive indexes. The refractive index is a measure of how much a substance can slow down, refract or bend the light waves that pass through it. As the light encounters the glass jar and the liquid, it slows down, which causes the light to bend. This bending of light makes the pickles appear larger than they actually are, creating a magnifying effect. This is an example of refraction in everyday life. Now, let's look at the other options and why they are not examples of refraction: [I] The light that comes from the TV: The light emitted by the TV is a form of electromagnetic radiation that creates the colors and images we see on the screen. Although the light emitted by a TV travels through different layers inside the screen, the light itself does not significantly change its direction or bend in the process, so it is not an example of refraction. [II] The light from a fire: The light emitted by a fire is primarily due to the process of combustion, where chemical energy stored in the fuel is released in the form of heat and light. Although the light from a fire might be scattered in various directions due to its interaction with different particles in the air, it does not involve significant bending of light through different mediums, so it is not an example of refraction. [III] Turning the light on: When you turn on a light, an electrical current flows through a filament or an LED, causing it to emit light. While the process of creating light might involve various physical phenomena, including reflection and absorption within the light bulb itself, it does not involve refraction as the primary feature in this scenario. The focus here is the generation of light rather than the bending of light through different mediums."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Question: suppose no people put the fire out happens, how will it affect a GREATER negative effect on animals.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","output":"The supposed perturbation in question is that no people put out the fire.  The second effect mentioned is \\"those that survive have their habitat destroyed.\\" This effect refers to destruction of habitat as it results from the forest fire.  If people do not intervene to put out the fire, it could lead to more widespread and lasting damage to the forest - the habitat of the animals. This implies prolonged exposure of the habitat to damaging conditions. Therefore, if no people put the fire out, it will have a 'more' negative effect on the animals as the destruction of their habitat could be more extensive, exacerbating the situation for the surviving animals.  In terms of the supposed perturbation influencing the second effect mentioned, the result would also be ‘more’. That is, the lack of human intervention in extinguishing the fire would result in a greater level of destruction of the habitat, thereby increasing the negative impact for the animals who survive the initial fire. They would have fewer resources available to them, it would be harder for them to find a new suitable habitat, and the subsequent conflicts with other animals (as mentioned in the process) could be more severe.  In summary, not intervening to put out the fire would likely amplify the negative effects experienced by the surviving animals, leading to a greater level of negative impact overall."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

They are a cheap knockoff. When you are replacing parts for your plumbing, you do not want to skimp! Buying the actual Delta parts at my local hardware store cost 13, so I figured hey this is a great deal! I bought them, and when they arrived they were in little generic plastic baggies. The center parts are not grey like the Delta brand, they are a natural opaque color. One if them seemed okay, but the other had a loose fitting O-ring that caused the part to not function correctly. I didn't even bother with that one. I should have trusted my instincts and not tried the one that seemed okay, because when I installed it, the shower leaked right away. I got a refund, but I recommend you keep on looking until you get the real Delta parts! Go to a hardware store if you have to, since this ad strongly implied it was an actual Delta part. Is the review positive or negative? Answer:","output":"The review is negative.  Here is a step-by-step justification for this conclusion: 1. The reviewer begins by stating that the product is not a genuine Delta brand part, but a cheap knockoff. 2. The reviewer emphasizes the importance of not skimping on plumbing parts. 3. They compare the price of the actual Delta parts at their local hardware store (13) to the price of the product they purchased, suggesting that they thought they were getting a good deal on a genuine product, but it was not the case. 4. The packaging (generic plastic baggies) and appearance (natural opaque color instead of grey) are further indicators that these aren't genuine Delta parts, contributing to the negative impression. 5. Additionally, the reviewer describes issues with the O-ring on one of the parts and leakage after installing the other part. 6. The reviewer claims they got a refund, but still recommends avoiding this product and looking for genuine Delta parts instead. Overall, the reviewer had a negative experience with the product, suggesting that it is not a genuine Delta part and that it had defects. This led to a disappointing outcome and a recommendation to steer clear of this product."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

One of her four best friends playfully pushed her in the pool, causing the life-changing injury.Now, for the first time, the 30-year-old is talking publicly about that friend. She has remained fiercely protective of the woman since the accident, even turning down an interview with Oprah when the talk show queen's bookers said they would only have her on if she came on with that friend.Chapman has never named her childhood friend publicly – and still won't – but for the first time, she is telling PEOPLE exclusively about the broken friendship she says she fought hard to maintain.\\"In the beginning, she was there for me and I was there for her. She was distraught and depressed about what happened. But as the years passed, she didn't make the effort, it was just going through the motions and every time we spoke, I just felt like I was remembering the accident and going into the pool and I had negative feelings. I didn't feel that way in the beginning, but that's what's been happening over the last three years.\\"She says her friend came with a few other girls when Kaylee, who turned one this week, was first born, but that's the last time they were together. She and husband Chris, 33, welcomed Kaylee via surrogate last April.\\"I had to actually cut ties with her and end the friendship,\\" she says. \\"I had to tell her that we couldn't be friends because she just wasn't there for me anymore.\\"Chapman says she was honest after the accident when she was vocal about how the two remained close. But she says when that changed, she realized she needed to be honest once more.\\"One of the things that happens when you have this kind of injury is that you lose people, and I felt like I wasn't being truthful anymore because I did lose some relationships. It's sad and it's complicated, but she wasn't there for me when I needed her.\\"Chapman talks about her lost friendship in a documentary she and husband Chris shot for TLC about their journey to become parents. The network finished shooting in February and tells PEOPLE the as-yet-untitled show will air, they just don't know when.Chapman says she wanted to do the show to let people see the challenges and the joys of becoming a mom, despite being paralyzed.\\"It's so cool, she uses the back of my chair to pull herself up and she has figured out how to come to me when I go to take her out of her crib,\\" she says of her daughter, Kaylee. \\"She turns on her belly and scoots her way on to my lap. She is the only one who looks at me in the chair and it's normal to her because that's all she knows.\\"And this past weekend – as friends and family celebrated Kaylee's first birthday – she walked to her dad. \\"Chris opened his arms and she came to him. Everyone cheered and clapped for her!\\"Chapman is also excited by her newfound independence. A few weeks ago she started driving again for the first time since she was paralyzed.\\"It was a huge mountain to climb and once I did it, it really wasn't that bad at all. It's a workout because I have to get in and out of the chair, but it's nice to know I can go wherever I want, whenever I want.\\"It is a big turning point she says, one that has her excited for the future.\\"It's nice to finally have some independence and to know that I'll be able to do more for Kaylee as she gets older. She laughs all the time and makes me so happy and I just want to be able to do for her.\\" ||||| share tweet pin email      Rachelle Chapman considers her daughter “the missing piece” to the home she and her husband created.      “I got hurt right before the wedding, so for a long time, all I wanted was to get married,” said the North Carolina mom known around the world as “the paralyzed bride” after a fall into a pool at her bachelorette party left her a quadriplegic. “We were happily wed for a long time, but then I felt that I really wanted a child with Chris.”      Rachelle Chapman Rachelle and Chris Chapman, with their daughter, Kaylee, who turns 1 on April 26      The couple’s daughter, Kaylee, turns 1 on Tuesday. Relatives and close friends, including the woman who served as the girl's surrogate, celebrated over the weekend with an Elmo-themed birthday party “because Kaylee is completely obsessed with Elmo,” Chapman told TODAY. “It’s been a blessing and super annoying at the same time!”      Chapman said her daughter recently learned how to walk by using her mother’s wheelchair as a prop.      “She got a lot of practice holding on to the back of my chair. She would pull up and hold on to the wheel, and then walk to the back and hold on to the bar in the back,” she told TODAY. “My wheelchair was good practice for her. She would basically push my wheelchair. It was so cool she learned how to do that.”      Kaylee also has learned to use her special wheelchair-accessible crib to her advantage. She recently learned how to crawl out of it by scooting backward on her stomach and onto her mother's lap.      “It’s really hard to just to pick her up and pull her towards me, so this tactic works,” Chapman said. “And she figured it out on her own.

Chapman said that single parents rarely get questioned about their fitness to be parents.      “Chris and I together as a team are more than capable of taking care of a baby, especially with the help of my mother, who was all in from the beginning,” she said.      Rachelle Chapman Rachelle Chapman with her daughter, Kaylee      Chapman’s mother lives with the family during the week, mainly to help Chapman get out of bed and into her wheelchair in the mornings, when her husband has to leave for his job as a middle school science teacher.      “I want people to realize, yeah, even though my fingers don’t work, I have found a way to manipulate my hands to do a lot of things. I can hold Kaylee. I can feed Kaylee and I can play with her while Chris is washing bottles or whatever. We have a system that works for us,” she said.      “And beyond love, Kaylee has a house over her head and food in her tummy. She’s a happy, happy baby who doesn’t realize that I’m different. This is normal for her.”      RELATED: 'What I always wanted': 'Paralyzed bride' expecting first child through surrogate      Chapman said she’d love to have more children but doesn’t know if she and her husband could afford the cost of another surrogate. Chapman is unable to sustain a pregnancy on her own because of blood pressure medication she has taken since her accident.      “I’d love to have more. We did IVF and I have these healthy embryos sitting in California, but I’d still require a surrogate, and it comes down to money,” she said.      Courtesy of Rachelle Chapman Chapman's daughter, Kaylee      Chapman has been working with the cable network TLC over the past year on an upcoming one-hour show that focuses on her journey to becoming a mother. The show also will feature her talking publicly for the first time about her relationship with the friend whose playful push into the pool led to her accident.      “I didn’t blame her for hurting me, because we’ve all pushed somebody in a pool and I was very supportive of her. The first year I made sure that she was OK, even more than me,” said Chapman, who still refuses to disclose the woman's name. Eventually, the relationship grew strained.      \\"We aren’t very close friends anymore and I talk about it for the first time on the show,\\" she said.      In addition to becoming a mom within the last year, Chapman also learned how to drive her wheelchair-adapted van. She had delayed learning how, mainly because she's never driven a vehicle so large. But after realizing one day that she had no way of getting to her wheelchair rugby practice, she decided it was time to learn.      “Eventually, I want to be able to take Kaylee to dance class or tennis lessons and not have to rely on somebody else to do that,” she said. \\"Once she can get in and out of her car seat on her own, or old enough not to need one at all, I'll be able to do that.\\"      Follow TODAY.com writer Eun Kyung Kim on Twitter. ||||| Write a summary.","output":"Rachelle Chapman, a 30-year-old woman from Knightdale, North Carolina, who became known as the \\"paralyzed bride\\" when a freak accident at her bachelorette party left her paralyzed from the chest down, has opened up about the friend who caused the accident and the end of their friendship.

How to ice cookies  Bake your cookies and allow them to cool.  Fresh from your oven, your cookies will be too hot to handle, but even warm cookies can cause your icing to melt and ruin your designs. To prevent this from happening, wait until the cookies are cool to the touch before icing.","output":"Step 1: Prepare the icing Gather all the necessary ingredients and tools to prepare the icing. Select the desired icing type, such as royal icing, powdered sugar icing, or buttercream icing. You will also need mixing bowls, whisks or electric mixers, food coloring, and piping bags or plastic bags with a small hole cut in one corner to apply the icing. Step 2: Mix the icing Combine the ingredients according to the chosen icing recipe, being sure to achieve the correct consistency. Too thin, and the icing will run off the edges of the cookie; too thick, and it will be difficult to pipe from the bag. Adjust the consistency by adding more powdered sugar for thickness or liquid for thinning. Step 3: Color the icing Divide the icing into separate bowls for each desired color. Add a few drops of food coloring to each bowl and mix the colors thoroughly. It's best to start with a small amount and gradually add more to achieve the desired shade. Step 4: Fill the piping bags Transfer the colored icing into piping or plastic bags, taking care not to overfill them. Twist the top of the bag to secure and hold it in place, squeezing out any air bubbles. Step 5: Outline the cookies Hold the bag at a 45-degree angle, gently applying pressure to the icing to create an outline around the cookie's edges. This will help prevent the icing from flowing off the sides during the filling process. Be sure to keep a steady hand. Step 6: Flood the cookies Using the same icing bag or a new one with a wider hole, fill the inside of the outline by gently squeezing the icing, moving back and forth to cover the surface. You can use a toothpick or small spatula to spread the icing evenly and fill any gaps. Step 7: Add details or decorations Once the base layer of icing has been applied, add any desired designs, patterns, or sprinkles while the icing is still wet. This will help the decorations adhere to the cookie. Step 8: Allow the icing to dry Depending on the type and thickness of the icing, drying times can vary from 30 minutes to several hours. It's essential to give the icing enough time to set and harden before handling or stacking the cookies to prevent smudging or damage to the design. By following these steps, you can create beautifully iced cookies that both look great and taste delicious. Remember to be patient and creative, as practice will lead to more consistent results and impressive cookie art."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The samurai were usually associated with a clan and their lord, were trained as officers in military tactics and grand strategy, and they followed a set of rules that later came to be known as the bushidō. While the samurai numbered less than 10% of then Japan's population, their teachings can still be found today in both everyday life and in modern Japanese martial arts. Now answer this question: What class were samurais?","output":"Samurais were part of the warrior class in Japan. They were like special soldiers who worked for a clan and their lord, and they learned how to fight and plan battles. They followed a special set of rules called bushidō. Even though there weren't many of them a long time ago, we can still see their ideas and skills in Japanese life and sports today."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Short movie review: strictly speaking , schneider is no steve martin  Did the critic thinking positively or negatively of the movie?","output":"From the given short movie review, it seems that the critic is expressing a somewhat negative opinion about the movie. The comparison being made in the review is between the main actor or character, presumably Schneider, and Steve Martin, a renowned actor, comedian, and writer. Steve Martin is widely known for his comic performances and skills in the entertainment industry, with a long and successful career.  The statement \\"strictly speaking, Schneider is no Steve Martin\\" implies that the critic believes Schneider doesn't possess the same level of talent, charisma, or comedic ability that Steve Martin has. This suggests that the critic may have expected more from the movie or the performance of Schneider and was left unimpressed or disappointed. The use of \\"strictly speaking\\" indicates that this may be a specific observation or point that the critic wishes to highlight as opposed to a general condemnation of Schneider's talents or abilities. However, it does show that, in this particular instance, the critic thinks that the performance of Schneider did not live up to the standards set by Steve Martin. In conclusion, analyzing the given short movie review, it can be inferred that the critic holds a negative view or impression about the movie, specifically from the comparative perspective of Schneider's performance to that of the esteemed Steve Martin. While one cannot gather a comprehensive understanding of the critic's overall opinion on the movie from this brief statement, it does communicate a disappointment with the film in terms of the comedy and acting delivered by Schneider."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: While testing a communications laser in a remote part of the Congo jungle, TraviCom employees Charles Travis (Bruce Campbell) and Jeffrey Weems (Taylor Nichols) discover the ruins of a lost city near a volcanic site. Karen Ross (Laura Linney), assisting at TraviCom's headquarters, does not hear back from their team and activates a remote camera at the camp, discovering the camp destroyed and numerous corpses; something large suddenly knocks over and destroys the camera. Karen alerts TraviCom's CEO and Charles' father, R.B. Travis (Joe Don Baker), who informs her that the group was really there looking for a rare blue diamond only found there which would greatly enhance their capabilities, but does not offer any hope to rescue them. Travis implores Karen to lead an expedition and she makes Travis swear that he is sending her to look for Charles, not the diamond. Meanwhile, Dr. Peter Elliott (Dylan Walsh), a primatologist at the University of California, Berkeley, and his assistant Richard (Grant Heslov) teach human communication to primates using a gorilla named Amy (voiced by Shayna Fox). With a special backpack and glove, her sign language is translated to a digitized voice. Despite the success, Peter is concerned that Amy is having nightmares and psychological problems, due to several drawings Amy has made of jungles and the Eye of Providence. Peter attempts to gain funding to take Amy to Africa, but the university is reluctant, and Peter begins inquiring elsewhere. Romanian philanthropist Herkermer Homolka (Tim Curry) offers to fund the expedition; Karen, having learned of the trip, offers to fund it as well and to come along, hoping to discover the fate of her team.

Mitä objektiivisia tietoja on siitä, ettei kyseinen pyynti kalajauheteollisuutta varten vaikuta ihmisravinnoksi tarkoitettujen kalakantojen tilaan? Could you please translate this to English?","output":"The original question in Finnish is: \\"Mitä objektiivisia tietoja on siitä, ettei kyseinen pyynti kalajauheteollisuutta varten vaikuta ihmisravinnoksi tarkoitettujen kalakantojen tilaan?\\" The English translation would be: \\"What objective information is there to suggest that the catch intended for the fishmeal industry does not have an impact on the condition of fish stocks destined for human consumption?\\" Now, to provide a detailed and long answer: There are several factors and sources of objective information that can be used to evaluate the impact of the fishmeal industry on fish stocks destined for human consumption. 1. Catch quotas and regulations: The fishmeal industry mainly targets species of fish that are generally low in the food chain, such as anchovies, menhaden, and herring. Authorities set strict catch quotas and regulations for these species to ensure their sustainable harvesting and minimal impact on ecosystems, including fish stocks relevant to human food consumption. By adhering to these quotas, the fishing industry can minimize the negative impact on fish stocks. 2. Alternative sources of raw material: The fishmeal industry is increasingly using sources other than wild-caught fish to produce fishmeal and fish oil. These alternative sources include fish processing by-products (e.g., fish heads, tails, and bones) and farmed fish, which help reduce the pressure on wild fish populations. Additionally, technological innovations in aquaculture are making it increasingly feasible to sustainably produce fishmeal without relying heavily on the catch of wild fish. 3. Scientific research and monitoring: National and international research institutes conduct regular assessments of fish stocks, including those targeted by the fishmeal industry. These assessments are necessary to provide appropriate management measures, ensuring that the exploitation of fish stocks remains within sustainable limits without negatively affecting the fish stocks destined for human consumption. 4. Ecosystem-based management approach: Fisheries management is transitioning to a more ecosystem-based approach, considering the complex interactions between different species and their environment. This transition aims to ensure the sustainable use of marine resources, minimizing the impact of fishmeal industry activities on fish stocks relevant to human food consumption. 5. Certification schemes: The fishmeal industry can voluntarily participate in certification schemes such as the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) and the Global Standard for Responsible Supply (IFFO RS). These certifications provide assurance to customers that the fishmeal used in animal and aquaculture feeds is produced from responsibly managed and sustainable sources, preventing overfishing and minimizing the impact on fish stocks destined for human consumption. 6. Public awareness and market-driven initiatives: Increasing public concern about the environmental impact of food production, including the sustainability of fishmeal production, encourages companies in the fishmeal industry to adopt more sustainable and responsible practices. The market-driven initiatives by responsible stakeholders further reinforce the industry's endeavors to protect fish stocks. In summary, objective information showing that fish intended for the fishmeal industry does not affect the condition of fish stocks destined for human consumption includes catch quotas and regulations, alternative sources of raw material, scientific research and monitoring, ecosystem-based management approaches, certification schemes, and increased public awareness and market-driven initiatives. While this provides a level of assurance, continuous efforts are required to ensure the sustainable management of fish stocks and the responsible operation of the fishmeal industry."},{"instruction":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts. Each of those parts will have some instruction. Explain their meaning by showing an example that meets the criteria in the instruction. Use the following format: Part  # : a key part of the definition. Usage: Sample response that meets the criteria from the key part. Explain why you think it meets the criteria. Given the task definition and input, reply with output. This task is about creating an unanswerable question based on a given passage. Construct a question that looks relevant to the given context but is unanswerable. Following are a few suggestions about how to create unanswerable questions: (i) create questions which require satisfying a constraint that is not mentioned in the passage (ii) create questions which require information beyond what is provided in the passage in order to answer (iii) replace an existing entity, number, date mentioned in the passage with other entity, number, date and use it in the question (iv) create a question which is answerable from the passage and then replace one or two words by their antonyms or insert/remove negation words to make it unanswerable. Passage: The number of species of flowering plants is estimated to be in the range of 250,000 to 400,000. This compares to around 12,000 species of moss or 11,000 species of pteridophytes, showing that the flowering plants are much more diverse. The number of families in APG (1998) was 462. In APG II (2003) it is not settled; at maximum it is 457, but within this number there are 55 optional segregates, so that the minimum number of families in this system is 402. In APG III (2009) there are 415 families.","output":"Part #1: Creating questions which require satisfying a constraint that is not mentioned in the passage. Usage: \\"How many species of coniferous plants are there?\\" This example meets the criteria in part 1 because it requires a constraint (number of species of coniferous plants) that hasn't been mentioned in the passage.  Part #2: Creating questions which require information beyond what is provided in the passage in order to answer. Usage: \\"Which family had the highest increase of species from APG (1998) to APG II (2003)?\\" This illustrates the criteria in part 2 as the passage doesn't provide sufficient information about the increase or decrease of species in any family. Part #3: Replacing an existing entity, number, date mentioned in the passage with another entity, number, date and use it in the question. Usage: \\"In APG IV (2014), how many families were there?\\" This exemplifies the criteria in part 3 because it replaces the existing APG dates in the passage with a new date, APG IV (2014), leading to an unanswerable question based on provided passage. Part #4: Creating a question which is answerable from the passage and then replacing one or two words by their antonyms or inserting/removing negation words to make it unanswerable. Usage: \\"The number of species of moss is more diverse than that of flowering plants. Right?\\" This fits the criteria of part 4 because it takes the statement from the passage that flowering plants are more diverse than mosses and reverses it to form an unanswerable question."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Information:  - Scandinavia is a historical and cultural region in Northern Europe characterized by a common ethnocultural North Germanic heritage and mutually intelligible North Germanic languages.  - Deciduous means \\"falling off at maturity\\" \\" or \\"tending to fall off\\", and it is typically used in order to refer to trees or shrubs that lose their leaves seasonally (most commonly during autumn) and to the shedding of other plant structures such as petals after flowering or fruit when ripe. In a more general sense, \\"deciduous\\" means \\"the dropping of a part that is no longer needed\\" or \\"falling away after its purpose is finished\\". In plants it is the result of natural processes. \\"Deciduous\\" has a similar meaning when referring to animal parts, such as deciduous antlers in deer or deciduous teeth, also known as baby teeth, in some mammals (including humans).  - Prairies are ecosystems considered part of the temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands biome by ecologists, based on similar temperate climates, moderate rainfall, and a composition of grasses, herbs, and shrubs, rather than trees, as the dominant vegetation type. Temperate grassland regions include the Pampas of Argentina, southern Brazil and Uruguay as well as the steppes of Eurasia. Lands typically referred to as \\"prairie\\" tend to be in North America. The term encompasses the area referred to as the Interior Lowlands of Canada, the United States, and Mexico, which includes all of the Great Plains as well as the wetter, somewhat hillier land to the east. In the U.S., the area is constituted by most or all of the states of North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, and Oklahoma, and sizable parts of the states of Montana, Wyoming, Colorado, New Mexico, Texas, Missouri, Iowa, Illinois, Ohio, Indiana, Wisconsin, and western and southern Minnesota.

Minnesota was admitted as the 32nd U.S. state on May 11, 1858, created from the eastern half of the Minnesota Territory. The state has a large number of lakes, and is known by the slogan \\"Land of 10,000 Lakes\\". Its official motto is \\"L'Étoile du Nord\\" (French: \\"Star of the North\\"). Minnesota is the 12th largest in area and the 21st most populous of the U.S. states; nearly 60 percent of its residents live in the MinneapolisSaint Paul metropolitan area (known as the \\"Twin Cities\\"), the center of transportation, business, industry, education, and government and home to an internationally known arts community. The remainder of the state consists of western prairies now given over to intensive agriculture; deciduous forests in the southeast, now partially cleared, farmed and settled; and the less populated North Woods, used for mining, forestry, and recreation. Minnesota is known for its progressive political orientation and its high rate of civic participation and voter turnout. Until European settlement, Minnesota was inhabited by the Dakota and Ojibwe/Anishinaabe. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, the large majority of the European settlers emigrated from Scandinavia and Germany, and the state remains a center of Scandinavian American and German American culture. In recent decades, immigration from Asia, the Horn of Africa, and Latin America has broadened its historic demographic and cultural composition. Minnesota's standard of living index is among the highest in the United States, and the state is also among the best-educated and wealthiest in the nation.  - Minneapolis is the county seat of Hennepin County, and larger of the Twin Cities, the 16th-largest metropolitan area in the United States, containing about 3.5 million residents. As of 2015, Minneapolis is the largest city in the state of Minnesota and 46th-largest in the United States with a population of 410,939. Minneapolis and Saint Paul anchor the second-largest economic center in the Midwest, after Chicago.  - Agriculture is the cultivation and breeding of animals, plants and fungi for food, fiber, biofuel, medicinal plants and other products used to sustain and enhance human life. Agriculture was the key development in the rise of sedentary human civilization, whereby farming of domesticated species created food surpluses that nurtured the development of civilization. The study of agriculture is known as agricultural science. The history of agriculture dates back thousands of years, and its development has been driven and defined by greatly different climates, cultures, and technologies. Industrial agriculture based on large-scale monoculture farming has become the dominant agricultural methodology.  - MinneapolisSaint Paul is a major metropolitan area built around the Mississippi, Minnesota and St. Croix rivers in east central Minnesota. The area is commonly known as the Twin Cities after its two largest cities, Minneapolis, the city with the largest population in the state, and Saint Paul, the state capital. It is an example of twin cities in the sense of geographical proximity. Minnesotans often refer to the two together (or the seven-county metro area collectively) as The Cities.  - A bus (archaically also omnibus, multibus, motorbus, autobus) is a road vehicle designed to carry many passengers. Buses can have a capacity as high as 300 passengers. The most common type of bus is the single-decker rigid bus, with larger loads carried by double-decker and articulated buses, and smaller loads carried by midibuses and minibuses; coaches are used for longer-distance services. Many types of buses, such as city transit buses and inter-city coaches, charge a fare. Other types, such as elementary or secondary school buses or shuttle buses within a post-secondary education campus do not charge a fare. In many jurisdictions, bus drivers require a special licence above and beyond a regular driver's licence.  - The Horn of Africa (, \\"yäafrika qänd\\", \\"al-qarn al-'afrq\\") (shortened to HOA) is a peninsula in Northeast Africa. It juts hundreds of kilometers into the Arabian Sea and lies along the southern side of the Gulf of Aden. The area is the easternmost projection of the African continent. The Horn of Africa denotes the region containing the countries of Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, and Somalia.  - A \\"metropolitan area\\", sometimes referred to as a \\"metro area\\" or just \\"metro\\", is a region consisting of a densely populated urban core and its less-populated surrounding territories, sharing industry, infrastructure, and housing. A metro area usually comprises multiple jurisdictions and municipalities: neighborhoods, townships, boroughs, cities, towns, exurbs, suburbs, counties, districts, states, and even nations like the eurodistricts. As social, economic and political institutions have changed, metropolitan areas have become key economic and political regions. Metropolitan areas include one or more urban areas, as well as satellite cities, towns and intervening rural areas that are socio-economically tied to the urban core, typically measured by commuting patterns.  - A U.S. state is a constituent political entity of the United States of America. There are 50 states, which are bound together in a union with each other. Each state holds administrative jurisdiction over a defined geographic territory, and shares its sovereignty with the United States federal government. Due to the shared sovereignty between each state and the federal government, Americans are citizens of both the federal republic and of the state in which they reside. State citizenship and residency are flexible, and no government approval is required to move between states, except for persons covered by certain types of court orders (e.g., paroled convicts and children of divorced spouses who are sharing custody).  - The Territory of Minnesota was an organized incorporated territory of the United States that existed from March 3, 1849, until May 11, 1858, when the eastern portion of the territory was admitted to the Union as the State of Minnesota.  - Voter turnout is the percentage of eligible voters who cast a ballot in an election. Eligibility varies by country, and the voting-eligible population should not be confused with the total adult population. Age and citizenship status are often among the criteria used to determine eligibility, but some countries further restrict eligibility based on sex, race, and/or religion.  - The Ojibwe, Ojibwa, or Chippewa are an Anishinaabeg group of indigenous peoples in North America. They live in Canada and the United States and are one of the largest Indigenous ethnic groups north of the Rio Grande. In Canada, they are the second-largest First Nations population, surpassed only by the Cree. In the United States, they have the fourth-largest population among Native American tribes, surpassed only by the Navajo, Cherokee, and Lakota-Dakota-Nakota peoples.  - Anishinaabe (or Anishinabe, plural: Anishinaabeg) is the autonym for a group of culturally related indigenous peoples of Canada and the United States that include the Odawa, Ojibwe, Potawatomi, Oji-Cree, Mississaugas, and Algonquin peoples.

The judges for the competition include Scottish novelist Margot Livesey.  - A short story is a piece of prose fiction that can be read in one sitting. Emerging from earlier oral storytelling traditions in the 17th century, the short story has grown to encompass a body of work so diverse as to defy easy characterization. At its most prototypical the short story features a small cast of named characters, and focuses on a self-contained incident with the intent of evoking a \\"single effect\\" or mood. In doing so, short stories make use of plot, resonance, and other dynamic components to a far greater degree than is typical of an anecdote, yet to a far lesser degree than a novel. While the short story is largely distinct from the novel, authors of both generally draw from a common pool of literary techniques.  - Greensboro (formerly Greensborough) is a city in the U.S. state of North Carolina. It is the third-largest city by population in North Carolina and the county seat and largest city in Guilford County and the surrounding Piedmont Triad metropolitan region. As of the 2010 census, the city population was 269,666, and in 2015 the estimated population was 285,342.

Stories or narratives have been shared in every culture as a means of entertainment, education, cultural preservation and instilling moral values. Crucial elements of stories and storytelling include plot, characters and narrative point of view. The term 'storytelling' is used in a narrow sense to refer specifically to oral storytelling and also in a looser sense to refer to techniques used in other media to unfold or disclose the narrative of a story.  - Leon Eugene Stover (April 9, 1929  November 25, 2006) was an anthropologist, a Sinologist, and a science fiction fan, who wrote both fiction and nonfiction.

Often humorous, anecdotes differ from jokes because their primary purpose is not simply to provoke laughter, but to reveal a truth more general than the brief tale itself, such as to characterize a person by delineating a specific quirk or trait, to communicate an abstract idea about a person, place, or thing through the concrete details of a short narrative. An anecdote is \\"a story with a point.\\"  - Charles I (19 November 1600  30 January 1649) was monarch of the three kingdoms of England, Scotland, and Ireland from 27 March 1625 until his execution in 1649.  - Laren Stover ( b.

Fiction can be expressed in a variety of formats, including writings, live performances, films, television programs, animations, video games, and role-playing games, though the term originally and most commonly refers to the narrative forms of literature (see \\"literary\\" fiction), including the novel, novella, short story, and play. Fiction constitutes an act of creative invention, so that faithfulness to reality is not typically assumed; in other words, fiction is not expected to present only characters who are actual people or descriptions that are factually true. The context of fiction is generally open to interpretation, due to fiction's freedom from any necessary embedding in reality; however, some fictional works are claimed to be, or marketed as, historically or factually accurate, complicating the traditional distinction between fiction and non-fiction. Fiction is a classification or category, rather than a specific mode or genre, unless used in a narrower sense as a synonym for a particular literary fiction form.  - The Chesapeake Bay is an estuary lying inland from the Atlantic Ocean, and surrounded by the North American mainland to the west, and the Delmarva Peninsula to the east. It is the largest such body in the contiguous United States. The northern bay is within Maryland, the southern portion within Virginia, and is a very important feature for the ecology and economy of those two states, as well as others. More than 150 major rivers and streams flow into the bay's drainage basin, which covers parts of six states (New York, Pennsylvania, Delaware, Maryland, Virginia and West Virginia) plus all of the District of Columbia.

Q:What is the answer for the question: What's the profession of the person who causes Lucy to want to leave early? from the following article ?  Lucy Harmon, a nineteen-year-old American, is the daughter of well-known (now deceased) poet and model, Sara Harmon. The film opens as Lucy arrives for a vacation at the Tuscan villa of Sara's old friends, Ian and Diana Grayson (played by Donal McCann and Cusack, respectively). Other guests include a prominent New York art gallery owner, an Italian advice columnist and an English writer, Alex Parrish, who is dying of an unspecified disease. Lucy goes for a swim, and finds that Diana's daughter from a previous marriage, Miranda Fox, is also there with her boyfriend, entertainment lawyer Richard Reed. Miranda's brother, Christopher, is supposed to be there, but he is off on a road trip with the Italian son of a neighboring villa, Niccoló Donati. Lucy was particularly hoping to see Niccoló, whom she had met on a previous visit to the villa, four years earlier, and who was the first boy she'd ever kissed. Lucy and Niccoló had briefly exchanged letters after this first visit. One letter in particular Lucy had admired so much she memorized it. Lucy reveals to the gallerist that she is there to have her portrait made by Ian, who is a sculptor. She says it's really just an excuse for her father to send her to Italy, \\"as a present.\\" Smoking marijuana with Parrish, Lucy reveals that she is a virgin. When Parrish shares this information with the rest of the villa the next day, Lucy is furious and decides to cut her visit short. While she is on the telephone booking a flight to New York, however, Christopher and Niccoló return from their road trip, and Lucy is once again happy, although she is disappointed that Niccoló did not immediately recognize her. A:","output":"The profession of the person who causes Lucy to want to leave early is that of an English writer. In the article, it is mentioned that Alex Parrish, the writer, shares Lucy's secret about being a virgin with the rest of the villa guests.

I was going to swing by Nessa 's party before going over to Rob 's party where I would have met up with my husband . Choose your answer from:  --They would be in bed in PJ 's;  --None of the above choices .;  --They would have met up with their husband;  --They would not have met up with their husband; Q: What would have happened had the narrator not gotten sick ?","output":"Had the narrator not gotten sick, they had a quite interesting and exciting plan in place. The plan involved attending two different parties ensuring they would get plenty of social interactions, joviality, and laughter.  First, they planned to go to Nessa's party. The fact that the narrator planned to \\"swing by\\" suggests that this wouldn't have been a long, all night stay, but rather a short visit likely to show their face, engage in a bit of friendly chat, and perhaps enjoy some of the party food and drink. The use of the term \\"swing by\\" implies a degree of casualness, suggesting this might be a relatively informal social event like a house party or a casual gathering of friends. It could be assumed Nessa is a friend or an acquaintance that the narrator wanted to catch up with or perhaps, maintain a good relationship with. The narrator wasn’t planning on ending their night at Nessa's. They planned on going over to Rob's party afterwards. This multi-location party plan suggests the narrator had a high energy, outgoing itinerary for the night, further highlighted by how they mentioned this in contrast to their current situation of being sick.  The interesting twist is that the narrator intended to meet up with their husband at Rob's party. This suggests that the husband was a critical part of this plan. This detail indicates that they may not have been at home together earlier or they might have planned to attend separate parties first before meeting up. Their meeting at Rob’s party could have been an opportunity for the couple to catch up, enjoy themselves together in a social setting or simply have a good time dancing, chit-chatting, and celebrating. The mention of meeting the husband perhaps implies a source of happiness and excitement- a highlight of their night. So, under normal circumstances, had the narrator not fallen sick, they would have had an exciting, social, and love-filled evening attending multiple parties and meeting up with their husband. The answer, therefore, is \\"They would have met up with their husband\\"."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

I discovered this place not too terribly long ago, and as Paolo D. said, 28GO is minimalistic (but cool), Anime Ramen & Teriaki takes the idea and runs.  Don't get me wrong: I like my anime.  I grew up on the staples of Akira, Fist of the North Star, Vampire Hunter D and a good ol' fashioned Studio Ghibli film or five.  This place really took me to that nerdtastic time in my life.  The set-up is great: Bright, cheery, with upbeat J-Pop playing as anime dressed girls greet you in Japanese.  The art is everywhere, but is very nice and classy (I do wish they had some of the old-school classics, but what they had was fun).  On TV, some Pokemon episode was playing.  When we walked in, we were the only ones there.  About halfway through our meal, the place became packed.  Talk about good timing.  The food, however, was just right for the outing.  Their gyoza is pretty darn tasty, as are their HUGE bowls of ramen.  Everything was hot and flavorful.  Even their boba teas were excellent and sweet.  Service was very nice.  The girls checked by often, but not enough to become overbearing.  They were always on top of things, and super friendly.  I appreciate the effort they put into their costumes.  It's not as crazy as some theme restaurants that I've been, but it still makes it point that the name of their game is anime.  Even their little business cards are styled after one of those trading card games, which I found charming.  It's the appreciation to details (and the tasty food) that made this experience memorable.  So memorable, in fact, that it ensures that I'll be going to this place again, and soon.  It's a neat, clever idea, and I'm glad that someone obviously has fun with the business that they run.

And while it would not be a far stretch of the imagination to assume an 8-year-old's cooking show would be filled with dishes like pizza and burgers, Arthur's show actually features recipes like fruit salad a la creme de passion fruit and filet mignon  . The idea to record Arthur's cooking adventures on YouTube was rooted in the young chef's leukemia diagnosis   in August 2013.Treatment and recovery for the cancer left the young boy in the hospital for the second half of the year and Aruthur was even forced to spend Christmas Eve in the emergency room of So Paulo's A.C. Camargo Cancer Center. That's when his family--father Renato Gonzaga and stepmother Priscila Inserra--decided that Arthur should create something positive that would distract him from his health. The videos, which are filmed in the kitchen of a friend of the family, are in Portuguese. They show Arthur walking the viewers through a step-by-step process of the entire recipe--from preparation to cooking. Occasionally, viewers can see Arthur's father serving as his son's _ , passing ingredients and following his lead. Fluent in Portuguese or not, viewers can immediately notice Arthur's optimistic and friendly personality. It is perhaps these qualities that have given the young rising Internet star almost 5,000 likes on his Facebook Fan Page.

Your job is to determine which two sentences need to be swapped sentences in order to make a story that makes complete sense and is befittingly titled.

Sentence 4: It is motivational but also stressful. Sentence 5: My own work ethic guides my rate of pay.","output":"After reading through all the sentences, the story doesn't seem to flow naturally. Taking into consideration the title 'Self Employed', it can be deduced that the story is about one's experience being self-employed. Therefore, the sequence of experiences and the narrator's thoughts should be logically ordered for the story to make complete sense. Right now, the sequence is as follows: Sentence 1 talks about being self-employed, Sentence 2 jumps to the feeling of needing to rush tasks, Sentence 3 introduces the relation between speed and pay, Sentence 4 describes the emotional response, and Sentence 5 circles back to how the work ethic influences pay. The seeming disarray in the sequence arises from Sentences 3 and 5; both have a relation with 'pay' but are separated. It would make more sense if these two sentences were next to each other in the narrative because they're closely related. Therefore, Sentence 3: 'If I slow down then my rate of pay declines' should be moved right after Sentence 2: 'I find that it makes me need to rush through some tasks', creating a direct cause-effect relationship. Sentence 5: 'My own work ethic guides my rate of pay' should then follow, creating a natural flow and clarifying the relationship between the work ethic, rate of speed and rate of pay. Then Sentence 4: 'It is motivational but also stressful' seems to be the logical conclusion of this chain of thoughts. With this rearrangement, the answer would be '35', i.e., swap Sentence 3 and Sentence 5. Here's the rearranged story:  1: I am self-employed via online freelancing platforms. 2: I find that it makes me need to rush through some tasks. 5: My own work ethic guides my rate of pay. 3: If I slow down then my rate of pay declines. 4: It is motivational but also stressful."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Information:  - A farm is an area of land that is devoted primarily to agricultural processes with the primary objective of producing food and other crops; it is the basic facility in food production. The name is used for specialised units such as arable farms, vegetable farms, fruit farms, dairy, pig and poultry farms, and land used for the production of natural fibres, biofuel and other commodities. It includes ranches, feedlots, orchards, plantations and estates, smallholdings and hobby farms, and includes the farmhouse and agricultural buildings as well as the land. In modern times the term has been extended so as to include such industrial operations as wind farms and fish farms, both of which can operate on land or sea.   - Virginia (, officially the Commonwealth of Virginia) is a state located in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States, as well as in the historic Southeast. Virginia is nicknamed the \\"Old Dominion\\" due to its status as the first colonial possession established in mainland British America, and \\"Mother of Presidents\\" because eight U.S. presidents were born there, more than any other state. The geography and climate of the Commonwealth are shaped by the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Chesapeake Bay, which provide habitat for much of its flora and fauna. The capital of the Commonwealth is Richmond; Virginia Beach is the most populous city, and Fairfax County is the most populous political subdivision. The Commonwealth's estimated population is over 8.3 million, which is slightly less than New York City.  - West Virginia is a state located in the Appalachian region of the Southern United States. It is bordered by Virginia to the southeast, Kentucky to the southwest, Ohio to the northwest, Pennsylvania to the north (and, slightly, east), and Maryland to the northeast. West Virginia is the 41st largest by area, the 38th most populous, and has the second lowest household income of the 50 United States. The capital and largest city is Charleston.  - Kentucky, officially the Commonwealth of Kentucky, is a state located in the east south-central region of the United States. Kentucky is one of four U.S. states constituted as a commonwealth (the others being Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts). Originally a part of Virginia, in 1792 Kentucky became the 15th state to join the Union. Kentucky is the 37th most extensive and the 26th most populous of the 50 United States.  - A vineyard is a plantation of grape-bearing vines, grown mainly for winemaking, but also raisins, table grapes and non-alcoholic grape juice. The science, practice and study of vineyard production is known as viticulture.  - Livestock are domesticated animals raised in an agricultural setting to produce commodities such as food, fiber, and labor. The term is often used to refer solely to those raised for food, and sometimes only farmed ruminants, such as cattle and goats. In recent years, some organizations have also raised livestock to promote the survival of rare breeds. The breeding, maintenance, and slaughter of these animals, known as animal husbandry, is a component of modern agriculture that has been practiced in many cultures since humanity's transition to farming from hunter-gatherer lifestyles.  - Maryland is a state located in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States, bordering Virginia, West Virginia, and Washington, D.C. to its south and west; Pennsylvania to its north; and Delaware to its east. The state's largest city is Baltimore, and its capital is Annapolis. Among its occasional nicknames are \\"Old Line State\\", the \\"Free State\\", and the \\"Chesapeake Bay State\\". The state is named after Henrietta Maria of France, the wife of Charles I of England.   - A farmer (also called an agriculturer) is a person engaged in agriculture, raising living organisms for food or raw materials. The term usually applies to people who do some combination of raising field crops, orchards, vineyards, poultry, or other livestock. A farmer might own the farmed land or might work as a labourer on land owned by others, but in advanced economies, a farmer is usually a farm owner, while employees of the farm are known as farm workers, or farmhands. However, in the not so distant past a farmer was a person who promotes or improves the growth of (a plant, crop, etc.) by labor and attention, land or crops or raises animals (as livestock or fish).  - Aspen Hill is a farmhouse , built about 1840 near Charles Town , Virginia ( now in West Virginia ) , by James G. Hurst , a middle - tier farmer and landowner , who sought to build a residence befitting his rising status . The house occupies a middle ground between the grand mansions of the landed gentry and the more humble dwellings of more modest farmers . The house lacks some of the details and craftsmanship present in more substantial houses .  - An orchard is an intentional planting of trees or shrubs that is maintained for food production. Orchards comprise fruit- or nut-producing trees which are generally grown for commercial production. Orchards are also sometimes a feature of large gardens, where they serve an aesthetic as well as a productive purpose. A fruit garden is generally synonymous with an orchard, although it is set on a smaller non-commercial scale and may emphasize berry shrubs in preference to fruit trees. Most temperate-zone orchards are laid out in a regular grid, with a grazed or mown grass or bare soil base that makes maintenance and fruit gathering easy.  - Ohio is an Eastern state in the Great Lakes region of the United States. Ohio is the 34th largest by area, the 7th most populous, and the 10th most densely populated of the 50 United States.

These birds are most typically members of the superorder Galloanserae (fowl), especially the order Galliformes (which includes chickens, quails and turkeys) and the family Anatidae, in order Anseriformes, commonly known as \\"waterfowl\\" and including domestic ducks and domestic geese. Poultry also includes other birds that are killed for their meat, such as the young of pigeons (known as squabs) but does not include similar wild birds hunted for sport or food and known as game. The word \\"poultry\\" comes from the French/Norman word \\"poule\\", itself derived from the Latin word \\"pullus\\", which means small animal.  - Pennsylvania (Pennsylvania German: \\"Pennsylvaani\\"), officially the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, is a state located in the northeastern and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States.

A: The answer is:","output":"The movement of continents towards the poles or the equator is primarily caused by the phenomenon of plate tectonics. The Earth's outer shell, called the lithosphere, is divided into several large and small plates that constantly move and interact with one another. These plates are composed of the Earth's crust and a portion of the upper mantle, and they float on a more fluid and partially molten layer called the asthenosphere. The movement of these plates is driven by various forces caused by processes occurring in the Earth's interior. These forces include: 1. Mantle convection: The heat generated by the decay of radioactive elements in the Earth's mantle causes this semi-solid layer to slowly circulate and convect, similar to the way water boils in a pot. This convection moves the plates floating above the mantle in different directions. 2. Slab pull: At convergent plate boundaries, where one plate is forced under another (a process called subduction), the weight of the sinking plate creates a pulling force, which causes the plate to move. 3. Ridge push: At divergent plate boundaries, where plates are moving away from each other, the formation of new lithosphere at mid-ocean ridges creates a pushing force, causing the plates to move away from the ridge. These forces interact to move the Earth's tectonic plates in various directions, causing the continents to drift closer to the poles or the equator over millions of years. Additionally, plate movements can also cause continents to converge, diverge, or transform past one another. It is essential to note that these processes occur on a large geological timescale and are not apparent in human timescales. In summary, the drifting of continents closer to the poles or the equator is primarily driven by plate tectonics and the various forces associated with it, including mantle convection, slab pull, and ridge push. These processes occur over millions of years and continuously change the Earth's surface and the position of continents."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The nurse, a gentle woman with a kind smile, replied warmly, \\"This is your new baby sister, Elara.\\" Brenna's eyes widened in a mix of awe and confusion as she looked down at the tiny, fragile being cradled in her embrace. The infant's delicate fingers wrapped around one of Brenna's, clutching it tightly as if seeking comfort from the unfamiliar surroundings. With eyes closed, the baby's face was serene, her soft breaths punctuating the stillness of the room. Morgana, the family’s loyal feline companion, had always known she was something special. Ever since Brenna had rescued her from the chilly nights and unwelcoming streets, the two had formed an unbreakable bond. Day in and day out, the duo would engage in heartwarming rituals - from morning cuddles to evening play sessions - carving their memories into the very fabric of their shared lives. Roshan watched the unfolding scene with mixed emotions, his heart aching at the thought of losing even a fraction of Brenna's love to the tiny newcomer. Although he tried to push away the tendrils of insecurity creeping into the recesses of his mind, he couldn't shake off the lingering sensation that things were about to change. Forever.

Morgana's jealousy eventually subsided, replaced by a newfound curiosity that led her to develop an unlikely affection for baby Elara. Through tender sniffs and nuzzles, their bond strengthened, as did Roshan's, who soon found his own heart expanding with immeasurable love for his new baby sister. Brenna, now a proud big sister, devoted her energy to not only caring for Elara, but also nurturing the precious bonds with both Roshan and Morgana, recognizing that their love was not finite but ever-growing. In time, the family discovered that Elara's arrival had not fragmented their love, but had instead amplified it. The kaleidoscope of emotions that had once filled the room - doubt, jealousy, fear - had transformed into a powerful, magical force. A force so strong, it eclipsed everything that had come before. As they moved forward, hand in hand and paw in paw, they embraced the shared spirit of love that now united them more closely than ever.

Bank town on the other hand, had warmer nights because it was situated on a south facing hill.  Which town experienced a higher air mixing ratio?  Hint: Specific humidity (or moisture content) is the ratio of the mass of water vapor to the total mass of the moist air parcel.[13] Specific humidity is approximately equal to the mixing ratio, which is defined as the ratio of the mass of water vapor in an air parcel to the mass of dry air for the same parcel. As temperature decreases, the amount of water vapor needed to reach saturation also decreases. As the temperature of a parcel of air becomes lower it will eventually reach the point of saturation without adding or losing water mass. The answer to this question is:","output":"Bend Town experienced a higher air mixing ratio during the humid season. To understand why this is the case, we must first consider the factors that influence air mixing ratio. As mentioned in the hint, specific humidity is approximately equal to the mixing ratio, and it refers to the ratio of the mass of water vapor to the mass of dry air in an air parcel. The main factors affecting air mixing ratio are temperature and relative humidity. When the temperature decreases, the amount of water vapor needed to reach saturation also decreases. This means that at lower temperatures, the air can hold less water vapor before becoming fully saturated. Considering the situation described, Bend town and Bank town are both experiencing the same humid season, which suggests they might have similar levels of moisture in the air due to their geographic proximity. However, the significant difference between the two towns is the temperature at night – Bend town has cooler air, while Bank town has warmer nights due to its location on a south-facing hill. During the night, the temperatures in Bend town decrease, and its capacity to hold water vapor decreases as well. This results in a higher level of saturation, which in turn leads to a higher mixing ratio of water vapor in the air. On the other hand, Bank town's warmer nights mean that the air's capacity to hold water vapor remains relatively high, resulting in a lower mixing ratio as compared to Bend town. In summary, Bend town experienced a higher air mixing ratio due to the cooler temperatures at night, which decreased the air's capacity to hold water vapor and increased the level of saturation. Conversely, Bank town experienced a lower air mixing ratio due to its warmer nights, which maintained a higher capacity for holding water vapor and decreased saturation level."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

IBM opened a sprawling and sophisticated semiconductor factory here on Wednesday that cost more than 2.5 billion to build and equip, the largest single capital investment the company has ever made. The factory, which opens as the computer chip business is in a slump, is a costly and risky move for IBM. But it is also an expression of confidence by the company that it can remain a technology leader in the highly competitive global semiconductor industry, and a commitment that the best place to execute that strategy is in upstate New York. IBM is an exception among computer makers in that it still invests heavily in research to advance the design, manufacture and materials used in semiconductor chips. It is spending more than 500 million a year on semiconductor research and development. The factory will produce a wide range of specialized semiconductors used in everything from the largest mainframe computers to cell phones and video-game consoles. The new plant is part of IBM's push to gain a strong lead in chip-making beyond the personal computer business, where Intel and East Asian chip producers hold the advantage. \\"The core of our strategy is to lead in technology and attack the high-performance segments of the market,\\" said John Kelly, senior vice president in charge of IBM's technology group. An advantage to having the semiconductor fabricating factory here, Kelly explained, was that it was very close to its research laboratories in nearby Westchester County, N.Y.

Your body craves routine, and will adapt to a regular sleep/wake cycle. If your schedule allows, try to go to bed and wake up at roughly the same time each day.","output":"This will help regulate your circadian rhythm, which is your body's internal clock responsible for controlling your sleep/wake patterns. Establishing and maintaining a consistent bedtime routine tailored to suit your personal preferences can aid in signaling to your brain that it's time to unwind and prepare for sleep. Some of the activities you can include in your bedtime routine are as follows: 1. Engage in relaxation techniques: Various techniques like deep breathing exercises, progressive muscle relaxation, or meditation can help reduce stress, anxiety, and create a calm state of mind before sleep. 2. Decrease screen time: Limit exposure to electronic devices such as smartphones, tablets, and computers at least an hour before bedtime. The blue light emitted from these devices can interfere with the production of melatonin, a hormone that affects your sleep cycle. 3. Create a sleep-friendly environment: A quiet, dark, and comfortable bedroom can enhance your sleep quality. Invest in blackout curtains or a sleep mask to block out any light and reduce noise distractions with earplugs or a white noise machine. 4. Read or listen to calming music: Reading a book, magazine, or listening to soft, soothing music can help clear your mind of stress and daily worries. 5. Practice journaling: Writing down your thoughts, concerns, or making a to-do list for the next day can help empty your mind before sleep and lessen any lingering anxiety. 6. Focus on positive thoughts: Keeping a grateful attitude and concentrating on the things you are thankful for can counterbalance negative thoughts that may keep you awake at night. 7. Indulge in aromatherapy: Using essential oils like lavender, chamomile, or clary sage has been found to promote relaxation and encourage a restful sleep. 8. Enjoy a warm bath or shower: The warm water can help relax your muscles and the temperature change post-bath can bring on the sleepiness. 9. Avoid caffeine and heavy meals before bedtime: Stimulants like caffeine can interfere with your sleep, while heavy meals may cause indigestion and discomfort during the night. By incorporating some or all these habits into your bedtime routine, you create an association between this routine and sleep, making it easier to signal your mind and body to relax and prepare for a good night's rest. As you practice these techniques, you will find it easier to clear your mind and transition into a peaceful and rejuvenating sleep."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A stereotype is an over-generalized belief about a particular group of people. An anti-stereotype is an idea that goes against a common stereotype. You are expected to classify the passage into four types of stereotype or anti-stereotype: gender, profession, race, and religion. Problem:Passage: Despite having spent 15 years in prison, the prisoner remained gentle. Solution:","output":"The passage is an example of an anti-stereotype related to profession.  Explanation: The passage portrays a positive quality for an individual from a group that is generally perceived negatively. In this case, the target group is prisoners. Society typically holds negative stereotypes about prisoners, such as being violent, aggressive, or dangerous. However, the passage contradicts this stereotype by emphasizing that the prisoner remained gentle, even after spending 15 years in prison.

The man stalked her..","output":"To determine the cause for the woman filing a restraining order against the man, we need to analyze both options (A) and (B).  Step 1: Analyze option (A) In option (A), the man called the woman. Although calling someone is not necessarily a harmful act, it can be considered harassment if it is unwanted, repetitive, and threatening.  Step 2: Analyze option (B) In option (B), the man stalked the woman. Stalking is a pattern of repeated and unwanted attention, contact, or surveillance directed at a specific person that would cause a reasonable person to feel fear. Stalking can involve following, monitoring, harassing, or making threats. This behavior is considered harmful and can lead people to file restraining orders. Step 3: Compare both options Comparing both options, we can notice that stalking (option B) is definitely a more invasive and threatening act. While option (A) could involve harassment, it is not clear whether it was indeed harmful or just an isolated incident.  Step 4: Arrive at a conclusion Based on the information provided, option (B) - The man stalked her - seems to be a more plausible cause for the woman to file a restraining order against the man.

Question: How did Burke know so much about Rousseau? Context: In November 1790, François-Louis-Thibault de Menonville, a member of the National Assembly of France, wrote to Burke, praising Reflections and requesting more \\"very refreshing mental food\\" that he could publish. This Burke did in April 1791 when he published A Letter to a Member of the National Assembly. Burke called for external forces to reverse the revolution and included an attack on the late French philosopher Jean-Jacques Rousseau, as being the subject of a personality cult that had developed in revolutionary France. Although Burke conceded that Rousseau sometimes showed \\"a considerable insight into human nature\\" he mostly was critical. Although he did not meet Rousseau on his visit to Britain in 1766–7 Burke was a friend of David Hume, with whom Rousseau had stayed. Burke said Rousseau \\"entertained no principle either to influence of his heart, or to guide his understanding—but vanity\\"—which he \\"was possessed to a degree little short of madness\\". He also cited Rousseau's Confessions as evidence that Rousseau had a life of \\"obscure and vulgar vices\\" that was not \\"chequered, or spotted here and there, with virtues, or even distinguished by a single good action\\". Burke contrasted Rousseau's theory of universal benevolence and his having sent his children to a foundling hospital: \\"a lover of his kind, but a hater of his kindred\\". Answer:","output":"Burke knew so much about Rousseau because he was a friend of David Hume, with whom Rousseau had stayed during his visit to Britain in 1766-7. Additionally, Burke had read and analyzed Rousseau's works, like the Confessions, which provided him with insights into Rousseau's personality, principles, and actions. This close connection with Hume and the study of Rousseau's writings allowed Burke to form a critical opinion about the French philosopher."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: Recently the news broke that Microsoft are acquiring GitHub. Effusive opinions flowed from all directions: some saw the acquisition as a sensible fit for Microsoft to better support developers, and some saw it as a tyrant getting their grubby fingers on open source’s ecosystem. I am thrilled for Microsoft and GitHub for many reasons, and there will be a bright future ahead because of it, but I have been thinking more about the reaction some of the critics have had to this, and why. I find it fascinating that there still seems to be a deep-seated discomfort in some about Microsoft and their involvement in open source. I understand that this is for historical reasons, and many moons ago Microsoft were definitely on the offensive against open source. I too was critical of Microsoft and their approach back in those days. I may have even said ‘M’ instead of ‘MS’ (ugh.) Things have changed though. Satya Nadella, their CEO, has had a profound impact on the company: they are a significant investor and participant in open source across a multitude of open source projects, they hire many open source developers, run their own open source projects (e.g. VSCode), and actively sponsor and support many open source conferences, events, and initiatives. I know many people who work at Microsoft and they love the company and their work there. These are not microserfs: they are people like you and me. Things have changed, and I have literally never drunk Kool-aid; this or any other type. Are they perfect? No, but they don’t claim to be.

Title: Disappointing Experience and Poor Service I'm typically not one to leave negative reviews, but my recent experience at [Restaurant Name] was so disheartening that I felt it necessary to share. I had high hopes for this place, as I am a big fan of [Cuisine Type] and had heard good things about the restaurant prior to my visit. 1. Seating and Ambiance: Upon arrival, my party and I were left waiting for nearly 20 minutes just to be seated, despite having made a reservation in advance. The music playing in the background was too loud, making conversation difficult, and the lighting was far too dim to read the menu comfortably. 2. Service: Unfortunately, the lackluster service only added to the disappointment. It took an additional 15 minutes before our server acknowledged our presence and provided us with menus. Throughout the night, the server was inattentive, and we had to ask multiple times for water refills and essential table items like silverware. 3. Food and Presentation: When our food finally arrived, the presentation was underwhelming, to say the least. The [Dish Name] I ordered looked like it had been hastily thrown onto the plate. The taste didn't fare much better, as it was overly salty and undercooked. By the time I flagged down the server to address the issue, my dining companions had finished their meals, leaving me disappointed and hungry. 4. Conclusion: For the steep prices, I expected more from [Restaurant Name]. The lack of attention to detail in every aspect of our dining experience was surprising and left a terrible impression. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this establishment to others looking for enjoyable [Cuisine Type] cuisine.

In the first sentence - \\"Adults often remove paper from new nests and use it to recycle old ones.\\" - the focus seems to be on taking paper from new nests that have not been used or are in the process of being built. The implication is that the new nests are being dismantled, and the paper removed from them is used to fix or restrengthen old nests. This suggests that the old nests are being prioritized, while the construction of new ones is being halted or delayed. In the second sentence - \\"Adults often remove paper from old nests and recycle it to use for new ones.\\" - the focus shifts to taking paper from old nests that have already been used or have served their purpose. Here, the old nests are being dismantled, and their materials are being recycled for building new nests. This statement gives the impression that new nests are being prioritized, while the older ones are considered no longer suitable or necessary.

Knowing her \\"from before\\" could hint that this other character had a past connection with the woman, perhaps an old friendship, a previous romance, or any kind of acquaintance from older times. Blackburn's sudden realization indicates that this piece of information was an important detail, helping him to better comprehend the situation. This could be a snippet from a larger narrative, perhaps a novel, a short story, or a scene in a film or a play.

Step 1: Examine the title of the review The title reads \\"Lamest design book I've ever seen,\\" which suggests a negative perception of the book. Step 2: Identify key negative phrases in the review - \\"required to buy this pointless little book\\" - \\"still regret wasting money on it\\" - \\"no substance whatsoever\\" - \\"99% fluff\\" - \\"stoped bringing it to class\\" - \\"only useful in rare occasions\\" - \\"sold The Web Design Wow Book\\" - \\"embarrassed to have it on my shelf\\" Step 3: Assess the overall sentiment Considering the negative phrases used in the review, the customer appears to have an unfavorable view of the product.

Question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the person who was approved as king? , can you please find it?   Elgar is probably best known for the first of the five Pomp and Circumstance Marches, which were composed between 1901 and 1930. It is familiar to millions of television viewers all over the world every year who watch the Last Night of the Proms, where it is traditionally performed. When the theme of the slower middle section (technically called the \\"trio\\") of the first march came into his head, he told his friend Dora Penny, \\"I've got a tune that will knock 'em – will knock 'em flat\\". When the first march was played in 1901 at a London Promenade Concert, it was conducted by Henry J. Wood, who later wrote that the audience \\"rose and yelled ... the one and only time in the history of the Promenade concerts that an orchestral item was accorded a double encore.\\" To mark the coronation of Edward VII, Elgar was commissioned to set A. C. Benson's Coronation Ode for a gala concert at the Royal Opera House in June 1901. The approval of the king was confirmed, and Elgar began work. The contralto Clara Butt had persuaded him that the trio of the first Pomp and Circumstance march could have words fitted to it, and Elgar invited Benson to do so. Elgar incorporated the new vocal version into the Ode. The publishers of the score recognised the potential of the vocal piece, \\"Land of Hope and Glory\\", and asked Benson and Elgar to make a further revision for publication as a separate song. It was immensely popular and is now considered an unofficial British national anthem. In the United States, the trio, known simply as \\"Pomp and Circumstance\\" or \\"The Graduation March\\", has been adopted since 1905 for virtually all high school and university graduations.In March 1904 a three-day festival of Elgar's works was presented at Covent Garden, an honour never before given to any English composer. The Times commented, \\"Four or five years ago if any one had predicted that the Opera-house would be full from floor to ceiling for the performance of an oratorio by an English composer he would probably have been supposed to be out of his...

It was released on October 24, 1971, as the lead single from his second studio album titled \\"American Pie,\\" which was released in November 1971. The song was written by Don McLean and produced by Ed Freeman. \\"American Pie\\" is a culturally significant song that has a running time of approximately 8 minutes and 33 seconds, making it one of the longest pop songs to gain widespread popularity. It is widely known for its enigmatic and allegorical lyrics that describe various important events and cultural references in contemporary American society at that time. Despite its length, it became a major hit in numerous countries, reaching No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the United States and several other international charts. The song has long been associated with the tragic plane crash that led to the deaths of rock and roll musicians Buddy Holly, Ritchie Valens, and J.P. Richardson, known as The Big Bopper, on February 3, 1959. This event is repeatedly referenced in the song with the line, \\"The day the music died,\\" and serves as a significant milestone in the overall narrative of the song. Over the years, \\"American Pie\\" has been analyzed and interpreted in various ways, as listeners attempt to decipher the exact meaning behind its lyrics and the historical events it alludes to. As a result, the song has earned a special place in popular music history and has been recognized as a significant work that reflects the political, social, and cultural landscape of the United States in the late 1960s and early 1970s. \\"American Pie\\" has since been inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 2002 and was selected for preservation in the National Recording Registry by the Library of Congress in 2017, due to its cultural, historical, and aesthetic significance. Don McLean's contribution through this song has made a lasting impact on both American and global popular music culture."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

What is the solution?","output":"Alright, let's solve this simple math problem step by step, just like solving a mini puzzle! We have the equation: -683 * o + 79858 + 6200 = 0 First, we want to add the numbers 79858 and 6200 together. Imagine you have a box of 79858 candies and you put 6200 more candies in it. Let's do that: 79858 (candies) + 6200 (candies) = 86058 (candies) Now, our equation looks like this: -683 * o + 86058 = 0 Our next step is to isolate \\"o\\" (find its value). To do that, we want to move the 86058 to the other side of the equation. Imagine that 86058 candies are on one side of a table and you want to move them to the other side. To make it fair, you need to change the plus sign to a minus sign. It's like taking away the candies instead of adding them. So, our equation becomes: -683 * o = -86058 Now we want to find out how many times \\"-683\\" can be multiplied to get \\"-86058\\". It's like asking how many groups of \\"-683\\" candies can be made from a box with \\"-86058\\" candies. To find this, we'll divide -86058 by -683: -86058 (candies) ÷ -683 (candies per group) = 126 So, we found that \\"o\\" (the number of groups) is 126! That's our solution.

In 1980, the locomotive was repainted with a color scheme used by Canadian Pacific in the 1930s.  The black, gold, and Tuscan red paint job was popular with railroad enthusiasts and photographers.  The number 1293 was also restored to the engine.  In February 1982, the headlights, handrails, and cab roof of 1293 were damaged when the roof of a Steamtown storage building gave way to heavy snow.Although the Steamtown Special History Study reasoned that, since this type of locomotive had historically operated in New England, perhaps as far south as Boston, it qualified to be part of the federal government's collection, the Canadian native sat unused for 12 years following the move to Scranton. Ohio Central Railroad System purchased it in 1996, and it underwent a 13-month restoration.  As of July 2010, Ohio Central Railroad has lost control of most of its holdings, but former owner, Jerry Joe Jacobson, maintained a collection of vintage equipment including CPR 1293 and her sister, CRP 1278, which is also a veteran of Steamtown, U.S.A. operational locomotives. No. 1293 is still operational as of October 2011.Canadian Pacific Railway No. 1278, like her sister, CPR 1293, was also built by Canadian Locomotive Company in 1948, and is a type 4-6-2, class G5d light-weight \\"Pacific\\" locomotive.  It was purchased by Blount in May 1965, and renumbered 127.  Blount had planned to renumber all three of the series 1200 CRP locomotives in his collection from 1246, 1278, and 1293 to 124, 127 and 129 respectively, but 1278 was the only one of the three that underwent the change.  The new number remained on the locomotive from 1966 until 1973, when its former number was restored.  The locomotive was leased to the Cadillac and Lake City Railroad in Michigan from 1970 to 1971.

In this statement, the focus is on the importance of the European Union (EU) working in collaboration with influential regional powers. By cooperating with these powers, the EU can play a more active role in creating and enhancing an international landscape that aligns with their values and priorities. The EU's founding treaty, the Treaty of Rome, as well as subsequent treaties, such as the Treaty of Maastricht and the Treaty of Lisbon, established the common values and objectives that serve as the basis for its actions. These shared values include democracy, human rights, the rule of law, and the promotion of peace and stability. Moreover, the treaties laid the groundwork for economic and political cooperation among EU member states. To effectively promote its values and interests, the EU needs to be part of an international environment that supports collaboration and open dialogue. This requires fostering ties with leading regional forces, which are countries or organizations that significantly impact their respective regions. By working together with these powers, the European Union can ensure that it has a strong voice in shaping global politics and policies. Overall, the EU's goal is to work alongside other global players to create a more stable, peaceful, and prosperous international community. This collaborative approach is based on the belief that the more countries and organizations can agree on common values and goals, the more likely they are to achieve them. Additionally, by engaging with other regional powers, the EU can address global challenges more effectively, such as climate change, terrorism, migration, and cross-border crime.

If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\".  Plot title: Spirited Away Movie plot: Ten-year-old Chihiro (voice: Daveigh Chase in the 2002 English dub) and her parents (voices: Lauren Holly and Michael Chiklis) drive to their new home. Chihiro is whiny and unhappy about the move, especially when she notices that the bouquet her friend gave her as a good-bye gift is wilting. In sight of their new house, they take a wrong turn and follow a bumpy, decayed old road through the woods; Chihiro sees an odd old statue through the trees as they drive by. The road ends at a tunnel leading to an abandoned theme park. It gives Chihiro the creeps, but her parents persuade her to go in with them and look around.After wandering across a grassy landscape and a dry riverbed, they climb a stone staircase and come to a street lined with restaurants and shops. Most are deserted, but the aroma of cooking leads them to the one restaurant that's well stocked with food -- though it's mysteriously deserted. Mom and Dad are hungry and start eating, despite Chihiro's objections. The food is delicious, and Chihiro wanders away to explore while they eat. She finds a towering, ornate building that she recognizes as a bathhouse (a spa resort); there's a train track running under it. She meets a boy (voice: Jason Marsden) in traditional dress who is alarmed to see her; he tells her to leave and get back across the river before it gets dark. Chihiro runs back to her parents, but they're still eating -- and they've turned into pigs. Strange, dark, ghostly figures appear in all the shops and streets, frightening Chihiro and separating her from the pigs that were her parents. Chihiro runs back to the river, which was nearly dry when they came over but is now full and large, and she doesn't even recognize the buildings on the far side. As a riverboat approaches, she notices that her body has become transparent.The riverboat lands a big crowd of people in costume -- or maybe they're not people; at first they're only visible as paper masks. Chihiro thinks shes dreaming, but can't wake up. The boy who warned her away finds her and... My question: Who crosses the river and ruintes with her restored parents? A:","output":"In the movie Spirited Away, it is Chihiro who eventually crosses the river and reunites with her restored parents. After going through a series of adventures and challenges in the spirit world where the bathhouse is located, she manages to overcome the obstacles and grow as a person. With the help of her friends, including the boy named Haku, Chihiro successfully completes the tasks set by Yubaba, the bathhouse owner, and breaks the curse on her parents. Towards the end of the movie, Chihiro correctly identifies her parents among a group of pigs, which lifts the curse that turned them into pigs in the first place. After this, they all cross the river together, returning to the human world. As they leave the spirit world behind, Chihiro's parents do not remember their experiences as pigs, but Chihiro retains her memories and growth from her time in the spirit world. This experience helps her become more courageous and resilient, enabling her to face the challenges in her new life."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Help as much as you can. Q: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: A Bite of China, made by CCTV's Documentary Channel, sparked discussion not only on Chinese food, but also on locally made documentary programs. When you think of documentaries, you may think of them as long, boring programs. But documentaries can be wonderful and bring stories from the real world into our homes. With fascinating footage and stories, documentaries encourage us to think about interesting issues we wouldn't necessarily know about. So, what makes a good documentary, and what should we pay attention to when we watch one? Here, we offer a few easy strategies to help you get the most out of watching documentaries. Pay attention to the themes While watching a documentary, keep your eyes and ears peeled for the themes people talk about and what ideas they focus on. Is it meant to be informative or raise a certain emotional response? Think critically Listen to what the people in the documentary are saying and ask yourself the following questions: If you were debating with someone or introducing a new concept, would you say the things the people in the documentary are saying? Do the arguments make sense? Check the sources If you're sitting at the computer and can't think of anything to do, why not look up the points the documentary made and see if they are accurate? You could even read more about what is presented in the documentary. Who are the creators? The creators or financial backers of a film will usually be involved with how the subject matter is presented. For instance, as the documentary 2016: Obama's America was directed in large part by a conservative writer, it's not surprising that it's critical of President Obama from the beginning.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Google Buzz Has Serious Privacy Flaws Users of Google's new social-media utility Buzz are claiming it could allow anyone to see who they have been e-mailing. The world's number one search engine claims Buzz lets users \\"share updates, photos, videos, and more.\\" But users have discovered that unless privacy settings are changed, Buzz publicly shares details of users' contacts. When creating a new account, a dialogue box asks you to create a profile and upload a photograph. Buzz then automatically builds you a buddy list based on names in your Gmail account. But it then makes this list public on your profile, by default. It is a bit like someone being able to peek inside your e-mail folders -- and users who spotted the flaw are astounded. \\"In my profession, where anonymous sourcing is a crucial tool, the implications of this flaw are terrifying,\\" said Buzz user and journalist Nicholas Carson writing for Business Insider. \\"Google should just ask users, 'Do you want to follow these people we've suggested you follow, based on the fact you e-mail and chat with them? This will expose to the public who you e-mail and chat with most.'\\" In response, Google moved to tweak the sign-up process and now claims the opt-out option for a public list is clearer. \\"We think that showing followers publicly by default makes Buzz more useful because it helps people expand their networks,\\" the company said in a statement. \\"In response to feedback, we've made the option to hide these lists more prominent in the set up process.\\" But Nicholas Carson responded: \\"We continue to believe these chances to opt-out do not force the user to make a real choice about this setting.\\" He added, \\"Google could and should simply make this feature 'opt-in' so that people know what they're doing.\\" For more on this story, see SkyNews.com.

Here is a news article: Wellington - The three teenagers who survived 50 days drifting in the South Pacific in a small boat were on an alcohol-fuelled mission to find a girl on a neighbouring atoll who had caught their eye, a newspaper reported on Saturday.      They stole the tiny aluminium boat on October 5 after one of the boys was smitten by a girl who visited their home atoll Atafu in Tokelau for a sports tournament, the Dominion Post reported.      She returned to her home on Fakaofo, 200 kilometres away, after the tournament, and emboldened by alcohol they took off after midnight to find her, carrying only a couple of sacks of coconuts, some beer and a fuel tank.      After the boat ran out of fuel, they drifted about 1,300 kilometres before being spotted by a fishing boat on its way back to New Zealand on Wednesday.      They said they had eaten only a seagull that they managed to catch and had drunk rainwater but started to drink seawater when it did not rain.      The trio - Samuelu Peleha (also known as Sam Perez) and Filo Filo, both 15, and Etueni (or Edward) Nasau, 14, gaunt, ill and lucky to be alive were recovering in Suva, capital of Fiji, after being transferred to a navy patrol boat.      Two were released into the care of extended family members after being checked by doctors in hospital and the other was detained for further examination, a spokeswoman for the New Zealand High Commission in Suva told the German Press Agency, dpa.      Kuresa Nasau, a cousin of the boys and chief of Tokelau's 1,300 people, who live on three atolls hundreds of kilometres apart, was quoted by the Dominion Post as saying nobody saw them go but it would not have been thought unusual.      'Young kids go out fishing all the time, nobody questions that,' he said. 'They were seen at midnight and nobody suspected they were going to take off.'      Memorial services for the three were held on Atafu after surveillance flights by the New Zealand air force found no trace of them. Their rescue was hailed as a miracle by friends and relations.      Nasau told dpa Friday: 'They must have had a plan to leave the island, they must have thought this was a game, they would arrive at another country soon.      'When they were reported missing on the Tuesday, we were all upset at what they did, leaving the island without telling anyone. But now they are forgiven.'      The boat they took was the newest one bought for their small island and he said they would face some hard questions when they returned home. ||||| (CNN) -- A doctor in Fiji is examining three teenage boys rescued 240 miles from land after they were lost in the South Pacific for more than 50 days.      Apunas Sakamuri, spokesman for the police department in Suva, Fiji, said the three were admitted to Suva Public Hospital and then released to a private doctor identified as Dr. Rosemary Mitchell.      Filo Filo, 15, and his cousins -- Etueni Nasau, 14, and Samu Pelesa, 15 -- were famished, dehydrated, exhausted and sunburned when a crew member on a fishing boat two miles away spotted their 12-foot metal boat and alerted his superior.      The rescue, which came two weeks after hundreds turned out to mourn them, elated their friends and relatives.      Tanu Filo, whose 15-year-old son Filo was among the survivors, told CNN Thursday in a telephone interview from his native Tokelau Islands that, \\"I was on cloud nine. I was so joyful.\\"      \\"I couldn't believe my son and his boys were found again. Unbelievable,\\" said Tanu Filo, who noted that a traditional celebration is now in order.      \\"He alerted us that he saw something immediately on our bow, directly in front of us,\\" Tai Fredricsen told CNN Thursday from his 280-foot tuna boat. \\"As we drew closer, we could tell that it was a small boat of some type.\\"      The boat was a strange find so far from land. \\"It's not something you go in the open ocean with,\\" he said, noting that the boat was 240 miles northeast of Fiji when it was spotted late Tuesday afternoon.      And it got stranger. Inside were three naked teenage boys -- cousins from the Tokelau Islands 750 nautical miles away. Asked whether they needed help, they said yes.      When he learned how long they had been adrift, Fredricsen released his rescue boat, took them aboard his fishing boat, the San Nikunau.      \\"They looked very bad -- bones protruding from underneath the skin, but mentally strong, strong as an ox,\\" Fredricsen said.      He moved them to his cabin's king-sized bed, where \\"they all fit comfortably,\\" and began administering first aid to their burned skin.      \\"They were ecstatic,\\" he said.      He also gave them electrolyte-spiked liquids as he had been trained to do in a first-aid class. \\"I just gave them very small doses -- they more or less let the drink stay in their mouth and they swirled it around and let it absorb in their cheeks very slowly.\\"      After about half an hour, they were able to swallow, but he urged them to go slowly. \\"They knew I was trying to help, and they did what I said. The cooperation was just incredible from the start.\\"      After a couple of hours, they were able to eat small pieces of dry white bread, he said. Four hours later, he was feeding them slices of oranges and apples.      \\"And then they were starting to get a little bit carried away -- they were wanting some McDonald's or some French fries, but I couldn't allow them to have that yet.\\"      After six hours on board, the three teenage boys began to mingle with the crew. By 4:30 a.m. local time Thursday, they were transferred to a Fiji coast guard vessel, destined for a hospital in Suva on that Pacific island, \\"hopefully warm and cozy.\\"      Throughout, the boys were smiling, he said.      Natives of the Tokelau Islands -- three small atolls in the Pacific Ocean, about midway between New Zealand and Hawaii -- the boys said they had set out in the boat in early October to travel from one island to another, Fredricsen said.      \\"The islands are pretty close and they can be transited quite easily with these small vessels,\\" but they got disoriented after losing sight of land, \\"and that was it,\\" he said.      The boys said they had left their island with enough coconuts to keep them hydrated for two days, he said. But they used a tarpaulin to catch rainwater and for shelter after their clothes disintegrated. And two weeks ago, they caught a seabird, which they ate, he said.      About the same time, authorities had concluded that the teens could not have survived and declared them dead. Two weeks ago, their families and friends held a memorial service attended by 500 people, in the island chain that has a total population of 1,400, according to the Sydney Morning Herald.      But their rescue came just in the nick of time. \\"They did admit to me they had started drinking salt water two days prior to us rescuing them,\\" Fredricsen said.      Drinking excess amounts of saltwater can shut down one's kidneys, which can be fatal.      The boys were spotted in an \\"unusual place\\" -- west of the Tokelaus, between western Samoa and Fiji, said Eric Barratt, the managing director for the Sanford seafood company, whose boat found the boys.      It was dumb luck that the fishing boat came upon the boys, said Fredricsen, since its usual port of unloading and operations is in American Samoa.      \\"By chance, we were going to New Zealand to unload\\" because the boat was scheduled to be pulled from the water and inspected, a quadrennial event, he said.      Fredricsen called the Tokelau Islands and informed Pelesa's grandmother of his unusual catch.      \\"I just told her we found her kids, and it was total hysteria,\\" Fredricsen said. \\"It was just amazing.\\"      Pelesa's uncle, Lakia Kalolo, told CNN that Pelesa's grandmother broke the news to him and others. \\"You should have seen the village, you should have seen the people here,\\" he said. \\"They were happy, very happy. Everybody was crying ... We gave thanks to God.\\"      Tanu Filo described a similar scene, with singing and hugging among the villagers when the good news arrived. But when Filo Filo first phoned his father from the boat, \\"he cried more than he talked,\\" his father Tanu recalled.      \\"I can tell you that he's tired and all, from the way he speaks,\\" Tanu      Filo said. \\"But he was so happy.\\" Fredricsen said the boys left their mark on him and his crewmates -- not only because of what they endured while lost at sea, but because of their attitudes after rescue.      \\"It was just an uplifting experience to meet these young men,\\" Fredricsen said. \\"They didn't give up.\\"      Tanu Filo said locals are \\"trying to plan a celebration in a Tokelean way.\\" Besides the boys, he would like the tuna boat's captain and crew to join in the celebratory eating, singing and joy.      \\"I'd like to say thanks, and shake hands and celebrate ... together,\\" Tanu Filo said. \\"We want to invite them to the feast.\\"      -- CNN's Salma Abdelaziz and Tom Watkins contributed to this story. ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"Three teenagers from Tokelau Islands spent 50 days drifting in the South Pacific in a small stolen boat before being rescued. The boys stole the boat to find a girl from a neighboring atoll who had caught their attention, and they set off carrying limited supplies. After the boat ran out of fuel, they drifted approximately 1,300 kilometers before being spotted by a fishing boat. They survived by eating a single seagull and drinking rainwater, but resorted to drinking seawater in the absence of rain. The teenagers were hospitalized in Suva, Fiji, and have been recovering.

Lay 1 to 2 pieces of opah on a plate and brush 1 to 2 tablespoons (15 to 30 mL) of melted butter or olive oil over the fish. Spread the blackening seasoning evenly over the fish. Use your fingers to rub the seasoning into the fish and set it aside while you heat the grill. Turn a gas grill to high or heat a full chimney of briquettes. Once the briquettes are hot and lightly covered in ash, dump them in the center of the grill grate. Brush a little canola or vegetable oil on the grate to prevent the fish from sticking to it. Lay the seasoned opah on the grill so it's directly over the briquettes or the hottest part of the grill. Cook the opah for 5 minutes so it blackens on the bottom. Use tongs to flip the fish over and grill it until it's cooked on the outside. The opah will be medium-rare after 3 to 5 minutes, but you could cook it 2 to 3 more minutes, if you prefer your fish well-done. If the fish is medium-rare, it will be soft and tender. Well-done fish will be completely dry, firm, and flaky. Remove the opah from the grill and serve it immediately. Blackened opah goes well with steamed rice, cabbage, or roasted vegetables. Refrigerate leftover blackened opah in an airtight container for 3 to 4 days.","output":"This article is a recipe for making yummy blackened opah fish.

Much of the toughness or undesirable gaminess negatively associated with venison can be lessened by removing these parts. The meat is at the perfect stage for butchering, which will also save time down the road when you're ready to defrost it and get cooking.

Squeeze as much of the air as possible out of the bags and that the bags are sealed tightly before placing them in the freezer. Don't forget to date the meat.

India accorded a red-carpet welcome Tuesday to the top leader of Myanmar's military junta, currently on a five-day visit aimed at strengthening diplomatic and economic ties between the neighboring countries. Gen. Than Shwe received a ceremonial reception in the sandstone presidential palace in New Delhi before he drove to the shrine to India's independence leader Mahatma Gandhi to pay homage. Indian president Pratibha Devisingh Patil, prime minister Manmohan Singh, members of his cabinet and several top bureaucrats greeted the junta leader as a state guest. The military ruler's trip underscored the close relationship between the two nations -- one seen as one of the world's most vibrant democracies and another despised by the West as a repressive regime. In 1951, the two countries signed what they called a \\"treaty of friendship,\\" and over the past few years, bilateral trade has soared to almost 1 billion, according to Indian officials. Several Indian companies have invested in Myanmar's energy sector. And India's main space agency has helped set up a data-processing center in Yangon for remote-sensing applications, authorities in New Delhi say. Than Shwe's visit began on Sunday with a tour of sacred Buddhist sites in eastern India. It came days after U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton urged India and other countries in the region to push Myanmar, formerly known as Burma, to comply with UN human rights resolutions and nuclear nonproliferation agreements. \\"It is critical that Burma hear from you, its neighbors,\\" she said in a speech at the Association of Southeast Asian Nations meeting. Clinton described life in Myanmar as \\"dangerous\\" for the country's inhabitants and called upon other nations to push for democratic reforms there. \\"We would encourage India and other countries to send a clear message to Burma that it needs to change its course,\\" State Department spokesman P.J.

Question: Given the background: You may hear males \\"ribbiting,\\" producing a mating call used to attract females to the bodies of water best for mating and breeding. Frog calls can occur during the day or night. Each frog species has a different call that is used to attract mates and warn off rivals. When a female picks a male whose call she likes, the male grabs her and squeezes across her back and around her abdomen. This causes the female to release her eggs. The male then fertilizes the eggs and, in some species, also guards them.  and the situation: Sandra liked all creatures but loved to study frogs. Her sister Julie studied more about fish and butterflies. They both loved nature.  Answer the following question: Which sister heard fewer male frogs \\"ribbiting\\"? Answer:","output":"The sister who likely heard fewer male frogs \\"ribbiting\\" would be Julie.  The background information clearly indicates that the activity of \\"ribbiting\\" is associated with male frogs. So, the person who is more likely to hear this activity frequently would be the one who spends more time studying frogs. According to the situation provided, Sandra is the one who has special interest in studying frogs. On the other hand, Julie is more interested in studying fish and butterflies. Thus, her exposure to frogs might be less compared to Sandra.  Considering these factors, we can infer that Julie heard fewer male frogs \\"ribbiting\\". However, it's important to note that the interest in studying particular animals doesn't necessarily limit their exposure to others. Julie could have still encountered frog sounds during her outings, but likely not as frequently as Sandra."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In 2009, Europe felt the full brunt of the global economic crisis. Indeed, the impact of this period could not have been more detrimental on the poverty level across the EU, especially for the 17% of Europeans living below the poverty line in 2008. Translate to Romanian","output":"În 2009, Europa a simțit impactul puternic al crizei economice globale. Cu siguranță, efectele acestei perioade nu ar fi putut fi mai dăunătoare pentru nivelul sărăciei din întreaga UE, mai ales pentru cei 17% dintre europeni care trăiau sub limita sărăciei în 2008. În urma crizei, economiile multor țări europene au fost profund destabilizate, ceea ce a dus la o creștere a nivelului sărăciei și la numeroase provocări economice și sociale. În această perioadă nefastă, toate statele membre ale UE au fost obligate să ia decizii dificile și să își reconsidere propriile politici economice și de creștere. Problema sărăciei în Europa în această perioadă poate fi atribuită în mare parte repercusiunilor crizei economice care a afectat întreaga lume. Unul dintre factorii principali care au alimentat această criză a fost prăbușirea pieței imobiliare din Statele Unite, care a dus, de asemenea, la o criză financiară globală. Instituțiile financiare europene, prin expunerea lor la active toxice și la riscuri semnificative, au fost puternic afectate, ceea ce a dus la o diminuare a investițiilor și la o creștere a șomajului în Europa. De asemenea, această criză economică a avut un impact negativ asupra nivelului de trai și al bunăstării sociale în Europa. Din cauza reducerii puterii de cumpărare a famililor și creșterii ratei inflației, multe gospodării au întâmpinat probleme și mai mari în îndeplinirea nevoilor de bază. Drept urmare, statele membre UE au fost nevoite să ia măsuri pentru a contracara efectele crizei și a îmbunătăți calitatea vieții cetățenilor lor. De exemplu, guvernele au implementat politici și programe de austeritate în încercarea de a echilibra bugetele naționale și de a reduce povara datoriilor publice. Aceasta a însemnat, adesea, tăierea cheltuielilor pentru sănătate, educație și asigurări sociale, ceea ce a dus inevitabil la un declin al nivelului de trai pentru anumite categorii sociale. Cu toate acestea, în timp, unele guverne au început să recupereze și să încerce să facă față provocărilor cauzate de criza economică, revizuind prioritățile lor economice și adoptând măsuri orientate spre o redresare durabilă și o creștere incluzivă. Inițiative precum Fondul Social European sau Strategia Europa 2020 au fost dezvoltate pentru a răspunde la problemele sociale și economice, promovând ocuparea forței de muncă, garantând mai multe oportunități pentru tineri și abordând excluziunea socială. În concluzie, criza economică globală din 2009 a avut un impact devastator asupra nivelului sărăciei în Europa, în special pentru cei care trăiau deja în condiții precare înainte de criză. În acest context, statele membre UE și-au ajustat politicile economice și sociale pentru a face față provocărilor pe termen lung și a reduce efectele adâncite ale acestei crize asupra cetățenilor lor. Chiar dacă situația sărăciei în Europa a început să se îmbunătățească, eforturile continue sunt necesare pentru a asigura un viitor economic și social durabil pentru toți europenii."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: Who is unimpressed by a magic trick?

Definition: Generate an appropriate single-sentence summary for the given text such that it includes the main topic of the text. Input: He is credited with helping achieve economic growth and peace after the devastation caused by the Khmer Rouge regime, responsible for one of the worst mass killings of the 20th century. But the prime minister, 65, is also seen as an authoritarian figure with a poor human rights record and the resources and will to thwart any real political challenge. He shows no signs of wanting to relinquish power - in June 2018, he vowed to rule for 10 more years. His ruling Cambodian People's Party (CPP) has dominated Cambodia for decades, but has faced competitive elections. However the party goes into the July 2018 elections facing no significant rivals after the main opposition - the Cambodia National Rescue Party - was dissolved. Political deals Born into a peasant family in 1952, Hun Sen was educated by Buddhist monks in Phnom Penh. In the late 1960s, he joined the Communist Party. He lost his left eye during an exchange of gunfire and he has reportedly said he can only see a limited distance. During Pol Pot's tyrannical regime in the late 1970s, under which as many as two million people died, Hun Sen commanded troops in the Khmer Rouge - although he denies accusations of complicity in the regime's crimes. In 1977 he fled to Vietnam to join troops opposed to the Khmer Rouge. When Vietnam installed a new government in Cambodia in 1979, he returned as minister of foreign affairs, becoming prime minister in 1985 at the age of 33. Hun Sen lost the 1993 elections, but he refused to accept the results and forced a negotiation to become second prime minister alongside the Funcinpec Party's Prince Norodom Ranariddh. He went on to seize power in a bloody coup in 1997, forcing Prince Ranariddh to temporarily leave the country. The CPP won general elections in 2003 but did not have a two-thirds majority, so it struck a deal with Funcinpec in 2004, ending almost a year of political deadlock. Hun Sen was re-elected prime minister by parliament in July 2004. Warnings of war In Cambodia's 2008 elections the CPP won most of the contested seats. But the polls were criticised by international monitors, with the EU saying the ruling party made \\"consistent and widespread\\" use of state resources for its own campaign. Hun Sen takes credit for Cambodia's rapid economic growth and a booming garment sector that manufactures clothes for global brands. He also regularly warns Cambodians that if he were to be ousted from power, the country would return to a state of war. He focused on this theme in the lead-up to the 2013 election, after two major opposition parties joined forces, presenting a united threat to the CPP. The party they formed, the Cambodia National Rescue Party, was led by Sam Rainsy, a former Funcinpec minister who has long been Hun Sen's chief rival. Ahead of the vote, Hun Sen faced calls from the US to allow Mr Rainsy to return from exile. He had been living in France after being jailed in absentia in 2010 on charges he said were politically motivated. Eventually Hun Sen relented. Mr Rainsy was granted a royal pardon and arrived in Phnom Penh to a hero's welcome from thousands of cheering supporters who lined the streets. A major challenge The CNRP picked up momentum and won 55 National Assembly seats to the CPP's 68 in the 2013 election - the worst result for the CPP in many years. Mr Rainsy and the CNRP - supported by reports of widespread irregularities from local and international election monitors - cried foul and rejected the results. They led a protest movement for nearly a year, including mass street rallies and a large sit-in at a park in Phnom Penh. It was the most significant challenge to Hun Sen's rule in more than a decade, and eventually he ordered the security forces to end the protests. He and Mr Rainsy reached a deal to work together under a \\"culture of dialogue\\" but this eventually broke down, with opposition party members and activists jailed. Sam Rainsy again fled abroad after a historic prison sentence was resurrected. In 2016, a government crackdown against perceived dissidents escalated, ahead of local elections in 2017. In July, a prominent political analyst and government critic, Kem Ley, was assassinated in broad daylight, supposedly over a debt dispute. Removing opposition After the opposition performed well in the 2017 commune council elections, Hun Sen and the CPP moved definitively against the CNRP. In September, Kem Sokha, the new leader, was arrested on treason charges and several other senior politicians fled into exile. Two months later, the Supreme Court dissolved the CNRP completely, paving the way for national elections in 2018 that have been rejected as illegitimate by the EU and US government. Hun Sen is facing calls for sanctions against his inner circle, but appears to be pushing ahead to consolidate control. Analysts say he is grooming his three sons - all of whom are in powerful positions either in the party, military or government - to take the reins when he eventually steps down. But no one knows when that might be. Output:","output":"Hun Sen, Cambodia's long-serving prime minister, has maintained power through authoritarian measures and the elimination of significant political opposition, despite contributions to economic growth and a lull in the ongoing war."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer this question: what is the main purpose of the league of nations?","output":"The main purpose of the League of Nations was to maintain international peace and security, promote cooperation among nations, and prevent the outbreak of another large-scale conflict like the devastating World War I, which preceded its establishment. Essentially, the League of Nations was the first international organization aimed at fostering diplomacy and dialogue, in an effort to prevent the escalation of disputes and preserve peace among nations. The League of Nations was established in January 1920 as a result of the Paris Peace Conference, following the end of World War I. It was the brainchild of then-U.S. President Woodrow Wilson, who detailed the vision for the organization in his famous \\"Fourteen Points\\" speech in 1918. Although the United States did not ultimately become a member of the League of Nations due to political disagreements, its ideals and objectives were crucial in shaping the structure and goals of the organization. The primary objectives of the League of Nations can be outlined as follows: 1. Maintain World Peace: The main goal of the League was to keep peace through diplomatic negotiations, especially through arbitration and the principle of collective security. Its Covenant, or constitution, envisioned an international community that would abandon the use of force and war to resolve conflicts, and instead find peaceful solutions to their disagreements. 2. Prevent Aggression: The League aimed to deter aggression by establishing mechanisms to deal with non-compliant and belligerent nations. This included economic sanctions, boycotts, or even the use of military force in extreme cases, although the latter was rarely applied in practice. 3. Disarmament: Recognizing that nations' stockpiling of weapons and military resources led to a heightened risk of war, the League sought to promote disarmament by encouraging countries to limit their armed forces and armaments. By doing so, this would reduce the probability of another all-out conflict and increase the prospects of peaceful diplomacy. 4. Settlement of International Disputes: The League promoted the resolution of disputes through negotiation and discussion. It played the role of mediator and provided a legal framework for peaceful arbitration. If member nations were unable to arrive at a mutually-acceptable resolution, they could refer their dispute to the League's Council or Assembly, where it would be discussed, and potential solutions would be devised. 5. Encouraging Cooperation: To promote peaceful coexistence, the League encouraged international cooperation in various aspects, including trade, healthcare, labor rights, refugees, and social welfare. This cooperation led to the establishment of functional organizations, such as the International Labour Organization (ILO) and World Health Organization (WHO), that continue to work under the auspices of the United Nations today. 6. Protection of Minorities: One of the League's objectives was to safeguard the rights of minority groups in countries where they were vulnerable to discrimination and mistreatment. The League aimed to ensure that all people, regardless of nationality, ethnicity, or religion, could enjoy their inherent rights. Despite its noble objectives, the League of Nations ultimately proved to be ineffective, as it lacked the authority, resources, and enforcement mechanisms necessary to fulfill its mission. It faced numerous shortcomings and its inability to prevent World War II is often cited as evidence of its failure. However, many of its principles, ideas, and lessons learned served as the foundation for the creation of the United Nations (UN) in 1945, which continues to work towards similar goals with a more developed structure and enhanced legitimacy among the international community. The legacy of the League of Nations illustrates that achieving lasting peace and diplomacy between nations is a challenging but critical mission for the global community."},{"instruction":"Answer the following question: More than a third of the babies born this year could receive a 100th birthday message from whoever happens to be on the throne in the second decade of the 22nd century, according to figures published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS).

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the name of the quartet that wrote 21 songs during 19 days of rehearsal?  Audioslave's history dates back to October 18, 2000, when Rage Against the Machine's lead vocalist Zack de la Rocha announced he was leaving the band, citing a breakdown in its \\"decision-making process\\". Rage Against the Machine broke up as a result of de la Rocha's departure, but the remaining three members of the band—Tim Commerford, Tom Morello, and Brad Wilk—decided to stay together and announced plans to continue with a new vocalist. Several vocalists jammed with the three, including B-Real of Cypress Hill, but they did not want another rapper or anybody who sounded like de la Rocha. Contrary to popular belief, Layne Staley of Alice in Chains neither auditioned nor was asked to join the new project. Tom Morello denied this claim on his Twitter account in 2015. Music producer and friend Rick Rubin suggested that they play with Chris Cornell, the ex-frontman of Soundgarden. Rubin also persuaded the three of them to go into group therapy with performance coach Phil Towle after the breakup. Rubin was confident that with the right new voice, Rage Against the Machine had the potential to become a better band; he believed \\"it could turn into a Yardbirds-into-Led Zeppelin scenario.\\" Commerford later credited Rubin for being the catalyst that brought Audioslave together. He called him \\"the angel at the crossroads\\" because \\"if it wasn't for him, I wouldn't be here today.\\"The chemistry between Cornell and the other three was immediately apparent; as Morello described: \\"He stepped to the microphone and sang the song and I couldn't believe it. It didn't just sound good. It didn't sound great. It sounded transcendent. And...when there is an irreplaceable chemistry from the first moment, you can't deny it.\\" The quartet wrote 21 songs during 19 days of rehearsal, and began working in the studio in late May 2001 with Rubin as producer, while sorting out the label and management issues.

It's the most recent example of mass killing sprees that have traumatized communities over the years. Here's how one city responded. In the worst mass shooting in the U.S. at the time, a gunman killed 23 customers in a Texas cafeteria in 1991. (CNN) -- On October 16, 1991, 35-year-old George Hennard drove a pickup truck into Luby's cafeteria in Killeen, Texas, and fatally shot 23 people and wounded more than 20 before killing himself. For more than 15 years, the city next to the sprawling Fort Hood military base had the dubious distinction of being the site of the deadliest mass shooting in the United States -- until a student killed 32 people and himself at Virginia Tech in 2007. But","output":"rather than being defined solely by the tragic event, Killeen and its residents chose to respond with resilience, unity, and a determination to prevent future acts of violence. The initial shock and feelings of disbelief quickly evolved into a collective effort to provide support and care to the victims, their families, and the community at large. Various organizations, both within Killeen and throughout the country, offered their support, and the town emerged as an example of how a community can come together after such a harrowing incident. In the immediate aftermath of the massacre, local law enforcement agencies, emergency services, and volunteers came together to help with rescue and recovery efforts. Mental health professionals were provided to help those affected cope with the emotional trauma, and a temporary crisis center was established to deal with the practical needs of victims and their families. Prayer services and memorial events were held to honor the victims and provide solace for the bereaved.  The people of Killeen also looked for ways to change policies and laws to prevent such tragedies from happening again. Some survivors and families of the victims became advocates for gun control reform and pushed for legislative changes. As a direct result of the Luby's massacre, the Texas Legislature enacted legislation allowing citizens to carry concealed weapons, with the hope that armed citizens may be able to prevent future mass shootings. Furthermore, there was a nationwide call for increased gun control measures, including the improvement of background checks and restrictions on certain types of firearms, along with a focus on mental health care to identify and support those who may be vulnerable to violent acts.  Community outreach and support networks were strengthened in Killeen as well, with programs targeting mental health issues and resources dedicated to helping those in need. This included increased funding for counseling services, the establishment of hotlines for those in crisis, and more comprehensive outreach to ensure that those affected knew where to turn for assistance. Schools, churches, and other community organizations all played a role in addressing the issues that had contributed to this horrific event, and their actions demonstrated a commitment to fostering a safer, more supportive environment for all residents. The lasting effects of the Luby's massacre can still be felt in Killeen today, not just in the memories of those who were touched directly by the tragedy, but in the ongoing efforts to ensure that their community remains a place defined by its strength, resilience, and unity in the face of adversity. The incident served as a catalyst for change, both in the local community and in the way the United States approached the problem of mass shootings and the need for gun control reform.  In the years since the Luby's tragedy, the community has continued to draw on their experience to support and assist other communities affected by similar events. By sharing their stories and the lessons they learned, they have helped to create a network of support and resilience that stretches across the nation, fostering empathy and solidarity in the face of such violence. While the tragedy at Luby's cafeteria will never be forgotten, the response of the Killeen community is a testament to the power of collective action, the strength of the human spirit, and the resilience of those who choose to stand together and confront adversity. Through their inspiring actions, the people of Killeen have turned their darkest moment into a shining example of hope and perseverance."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

By Brian WheelerPolitical reporter Alvin Wilby, vice-president of research at French defence giant Thales, which supplies reconnaissance drones to the British Army, said the \\"genie is out of the bottle\\" with smart technology. And he raised the prospect of attacks by \\"swarms\\" of small drones that move around and select targets with only limited input from humans. \\"The technological challenge of scaling it up to swarms and things like that doesn't need any inventive step,\\" he told the Lords Artificial Intelligence committee. \\"It's just a question of time and scale and I think that's an absolute certainty that we should worry about.\\" The US and Chinese military are testing swarming drones - dozens of cheap unmanned aircraft that can be used to overwhelm enemy targets or defend humans from attack. Noel Sharkey, emeritus professor of artificial intelligence and robotics at University of Sheffield, said he feared \\"very bad copies\\" of such weapons - without safeguards built-in to prevent indiscriminate killing - would fall into the hands of terrorist groups such as so-called Islamic State. This was as big a concern as \\"authoritarian dictators getting a hold of these, who won't be held back by their soldiers not wanting to kill the population,\\" he told the Lords Artificial Intelligence committee. He said IS was already using drones as offensive weapons, although they were currently remote-controlled by human operators. But the \\"arms race\\" in battlefield artificial intelligence meant smart drones and other systems that roamed around firing at will could soon be a reality. \\"I don't want to live in a world where war can happen in a few seconds accidentally and a lot of people die before anybody stops it\\", said Prof Sharkey, who is a spokesman for the Campaign to Stop Killer Robots. The only way to prevent this new arms race, he argued, was to \\"put new international restraints on it\\", something he was promoting at the United Nations as a member of the International Committee for Robot Arms Control. But Prof Wilby, whose company markets technology to combat drone attacks, said such a ban would be \\"misguided\\" and difficult to enforce. He said there was already an international law of armed conflict, which was designed to ensure armed forces \\"use the minimum force necessary to achieve your objective, while creating the minimum risk of unintended consequences, civilian losses\\". The Lords committee, which is investigating the impact of artificial intelligence on business and society, was told that developments in AI were being driven by the private sector, in contrast to previous eras, when the military led the way in cutting edge technology. And this meant that it was more difficult to stop it falling into the wrong hands. Britain's armed forces do not use AI in offensive weapons, the committee was told, and the Ministry of Defence has said it has no intention of developing fully autonomous systems. But critics, such as Prof Sharkey, say the UK needs to spell out its commitment to banning AI weapons in law.","output":"\\"Dangers of Swarming Drones and AI in Warfare\\""},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

He agreed on almost everything and applauded Mr. Obama for many foreign policy achievements. The question is, Can we trust this cheerleader, whose advisers include a good number of neoconservatives? Is he not a wolf in sheep’s clothing? And if Mr. Obama’s policies are so good, why would we want to replace him with Mr. Romney? ALEXANDER SOIFER Colorado Springs, Oct. 23, 2012 Mitt Romney held his own, and more, in the debate with President Obama regarding foreign policy and the need for a strong economy and military to resolve America’s failing leadership in the world. He did not stoop to childish jabs as the president did, nor did he embarrass the president over his deadly failure to protect his ambassador and three other Americans from a terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya. Mr. Romney demonstrated a presidential command of the knowledge, concern and solutions needed, while President Obama poses the threat of American military and economic weakness. DANIEL B. JEFFS Apple Valley, Calif., Oct. 23, 2012 It looked to me as if this last presidential debate was the exact opposite of the first debate. This time it looked as if Mitt Romney was asleep. The debate was officially about foreign policy, which is where Mr. Romney is weak. President Obama kept hitting Mr. Romney on contradictions, and Mr. Romney failed to respond. Mr. Romney also had a last chance to finally reveal the specifics of his plans for the economy, and he failed to do so. MARC PERKEL Gilroy, Calif., Oct. 23, 2012 The core idea in “The Opiate of Exceptionalism” (news analysis, Sunday Review, Oct. 21) was corroborated by the presidential debate on foreign policy. Americans need, and want, to continue to believe that they are an “exceptional” nation, a special people. If there was one thing both presidential candidates agreed on, it was that America has to lead, has to expand its influence worldwide, as well as exert its will, for achieving a better world. Mitt Romney was more adamant in this respect, with his Hollywood-style belief that America should take up the mantle of world leadership, and be honored to do so. Yet President Obama seemed to be on the same page. Sadly, it all sounds like a 21st-century version of the 19th-century British imperialist and supremacist rhetoric. ANDREA CHIOVENDA Jalalabad, Afghanistan, Oct. 23, 2012 The writer, a Ph.D. candidate in anthropology at Boston University, is conducting ethnographic fieldwork in Afghanistan. In “Presidential Mitt” (column, Oct. 21), Bill Keller wrote that if Mitt Romney is elected, “he will be hostage to the same far-right forces he kowtowed to in the primaries.” That, in a nutshell, is a central concern of many. Undoubtedly Mr. Romney has learned the lessons from the first President Bush not to renege on the principles and promises that helped him secure the nomination (“read my lips ...”). Equally likely, if elected he will try mightily to prove his conservative bona fides to the Republican base. Any such strategy will be a surefire prescription to repeat some of the disastrous and wrongheaded policies of the second President Bush. LEE A. SPIELMANN New York, Oct. 23, 2012 This season’s debates proved one thing: the format is outmoded and this TV show should be canceled. Changing moderators is just a cast change. The actors have learned their lines and studied their roles. The lost live TV news conference should be reinstated and required for the next presidential election season. FRANCIS W. RODGERS Washington, Oct. 23, 2012 Regarding “Would You Please Let Me Finish...,” by Deborah Tannen (Op-Ed, Oct. 18): When interrupted, I use my favorite retort: “Pardon me for speaking while you are interrupting.” WILLIAM ZEPH GINSBERG New York, Oct. 18, 2012","output":"The final presidential debate between President Obama and Mitt Romney had contrasting opinions and showcased Mitt Romney's support for Obama's foreign policy achievements. Debating over foreign policy, both candidates expressed their views on America's military and economic strength. While Romney appeared as a somewhat cheerleader for Obama, agreeing with almost everything he said, some questioned if Romney's intentions may not be entirely genuine considering that his advisers include a number of neoconservatives. This raised concerns about replacing President Obama with Romney. In the debate, Romney demonstrated presidential command and knowledge of the subject matter, while President Obama focused on pointing out Romney's contradictions. Both candidates agreed on the importance of America's global leadership and expanding its influence worldwide. However, this stance has been referred to as a modern interpretation of 19th-century British imperialism. The overall analysis of the debate concludes that Romney wants to secure the nomination, while Obama is aware of Romney's conservative principles. Some argue that the format of the debates is outdated and should be changed or canceled altogether."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

She soon learns that another subject has also escaped the same facility, whom she initially believes to be Michael. As she makes her way through the high-tech facility, Selene sees flashes of someone else's point-of-view. Believing that Michael is mentally guiding her, she follows these \\"visions\\", which lead her down a garbage chute into a labyrinthine series of basement tunnels, where she encounters a young vampire named David, who has been tracking her. They quickly realize that the tunnels are infested with Lycans, who are hunting the subject Selene is connected with. Determined to reach Michael, Selene fights her way through the Lycan onslaught until she reaches the second escapee; not Michael, but a frightened and confused young girl named Eve. Using David's van, they start to make their way out of the facility, only to be attacked once again by a trio of Lycans. David manages to shoot one while Selene stabs another; but the third smashes its way into the rear of the vehicle, where it bites Eve's shoulder, which triggers Eve's partial transformation, revealing her hybrid traits as she savagely rips the creature's head in half.

Though both questions deal with the idea of making money online, they are not paraphrases of each other as they have different layers and nuances to them. The first question, \\"I'm 18. How can I make money online?\\" has a specific context to it. The age of the inquirer implies that he/she might be looking for ways which are particular to an 18-year-old to earn money online. This could mean part-time jobs online which do not require much experience, skills that an 18-year-old can master to earn money online, or ways to earn money online while studying.  For instance, an informative response to this query would detail various age-appropriate opportunities to make money online, such as: 1. Freelancing: Sites like Upwork, Fiverr, Freelancer offer countless opportunities. You could offer your services in graphic design, writing, data entry, social media management, coding, and a multitude of other tasks.  2. Online Surveys or Paid Reviews: Numerous websites would pay for your opinions on certain topics or on their products. Some of these are Swagbucks, Vindale Research, etc. 3. Selling Products Online: Sell handmade goods, vintage items, or craft supplies on platforms like Etsy. Alternatively, you could also try selling pre-owned items. 4. Content Creation: If you have a gift for speaking or writing, consider starting a blog, YouTube channel, or even a podcast.

The answer to this question could be a simple \\"yes\\" or \\"no.\\" However, a more detailed answer would give an explanation of how it is possible, including different but varied ways of earning money online irrespective of age, location, or area of expertise. To sum up, while both questions involve online earning, they are not paraphrases because they ask for different kinds of information.

Passage: Several archaeological finds on the territory of Woluwe-Saint-Lambert show traces of human activity during the Bronze Age. The first historical mention of the village, however, dates from the 11th century, when some of the forested land near the Woluwe River was cleared for farming. A church was built and dedicated to Saint Lambert, the 7th-century bishop of Maastricht who was martyred in Liège. At the end of the 12th century, the rights to the parish of Saint Lambert were given to the canons of the chapter of St. Michael and Gudula in Brussels. Various charitable organizations and hospitals then started acquiring land in this area. Throughout the Middle Ages, Woluwe was part of the Duchy of Brabant, governed under the usual feudal arrangement of those times. Among the Dukes' vassals were some powerful local lords and landowners. Some of Woluwe's territory also belonged to the powerful Forest Abbey (Vorst in Dutch) and Park Abbey.

A:","output":"Yes, \\"finish the nursing prerequisites\\" can be considered a valid answer to the question \\"What did Adrian need to do before asking Lee for a recommendation letter?\\" when applying for nursing school. However, it is essential to understand that this answer is part of a broader context and several other tasks or steps Adrian may need to have completed or considered before reaching this stage. Adrian's preparation for applying to a nursing school and asking someone for a recommendation letter may include various steps, such as: 1. Researching potential nursing schools and programs: Before jumping into the application process, it is crucial for Adrian to carefully research and identify the schools and programs they are interested in. This will help to understand each program's requirements, deadlines, and application process. 2. Completing the nursing prerequisites: As initially mentioned, the completion of required prerequisite courses according to the specific program or school's requirements is a vital step. These prerequisites may include subjects such as Anatomy, Physiology, Microbiology, Chemistry, and others depending on the program. 3. Gaining relevant healthcare experience: Since nursing programs are generally competitive, gaining experience in the healthcare field – such as volunteering, internships, or working part-time – may help strengthen Adrian's application and give them a better idea of what to expect in nursing school. 4. Preparing a strong personal statement: Crafting a well-written, engaging personal statement that reflects Adrian's passion, career goals, and experience is an essential part of the application process. This document should exhibit their motivation, skills, and work ethic for pursuing a career in nursing. 5. Identifying suitable recommenders: Before asking Lee for a recommendation letter, Adrian should consider the type of references required and identify people who can vouch for their academic, professional, and personal qualifications. These recommenders should have closely worked with Adrian, be familiar with their strengths, and be capable of writing a strong, personalized recommendation letter. 6. Requesting the recommendation letter: Once preparing their application materials, Adrian should formally request recommendation letters from their chosen recommenders, such as Lee. They should provide sufficient notice before the deadline and share their academic and professional achievements to assist in composing a well-rounded letter. 7. Preparing for possible entrance exams: Depending on the nursing program's requirements, Adrian might need to take additional entrance exams such as the Test of Essential Academic Skills (TEAS) or the National League for Nursing Pre-Admission Examination (NLN PAX). Adequate preparation and practice for these exams will be crucial in achieving competitive scores for their application. In summary, although finishing the nursing prerequisites is an essential aspect of applying to a nursing school, it is not the only task Adrian needs to complete before asking Lee for a recommendation letter. The process includes various other steps, such as researching nursing programs, gathering experience, composing personal statements, identifying suitable recommenders, requesting letters, and preparing for entrance exams. Each step plays its part in ensuring a comprehensive and competitive application for nursing school."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

On the day of the event, the guests were greeted with a grand entrance arch adorned with beautiful flowers and glittery ribbons. It made them feel like they were entering an entirely different world – the world of Princess Amayah. In the main party area, Amayah's mom had created the perfect ballroom atmosphere. She covered the walls with elegant white and pink drapes, which settled next to shiny, golden accents. The tables were dressed in luxurious tablecloths, complete with sparkling sequin runners and vintage-style dinnerware. Custom-designed centerpieces featuring Amayah as the princess took center stage on each table, surrounded by magical fairy dust and twinkling candlelight. No detail was overlooked in creating a delightful ambiance that made every guest feel like royalty. Not forgetting the essentials for any successful party, Amayah's princess-themed party came complete with delicious treats and entertaining games.

The guests could choose from an array of flavored teas, all of which bore enchanting names such as Unicorn Dream, Fairy Berry, and Mermaid Treasure, as well as classic options like Earl Grey or English Breakfast. Each tea was accompanied by a selection of milk, honey, and sugar, allowing each child to craft their perfect cup of tea. The party games were just as thrilling. Amayah and her friends embraced their inner royalty as they played games tailored for princesses, such as \\"Pin the Crown on the Princess\\" and \\"Musical Thrones.\\" There was also a crafting station where the children could create their tiaras, royal scepters, and bejeweled bracelets. Of course, no princess party would be complete without a magical, grand finale. At the end of the celebration, a charming storyteller, dressed as a fairy godmother, captivated the children with tales of far-off lands and brave heroines, leaving Amayah and her friends mesmerized and inspired. The young guests finally departed, leaving a trail of glitter and smiles in their wake. Amayah, still on cloud nine from her perfect princess party, skippered off to her room with a grateful heart.

He went from one company to another but no one wanted him. With little money left, he got to the station, sad and tired. All he wanted to do was go back to his small town. It was very late at night and the station was full of people. They were waiting to buy tickets of the last train. He bought the last ticket, and he was very happy. At that time, a woman with a crying baby walked to him and asked him to sell her the ticket. He gave her the ticket because he thought they needed it more than he did.

What is the solution?","output":"Alright, let's solve this math problem step-by-step, like a puzzle: 15*k - 7*k + 151 = 111 1. First, we need to figure out the pieces with \\"k\\" in them. So let's add the \\"k\\" pieces together:    (15-7) * k = 8*k 2. Now, our equation looks like this:    8*k + 151 = 111 3. We want to find the value of 'k', so let's get 'k' by itself by moving '151' to the other side:    8*k = 111 - 151 4. Now, let's do the subtraction:    8*k = -40 5. Finally, let's find the value of 'k' by dividing both sides by '8':    k = -40 / 8 6. The last step, do the division:    k = -5 So the solution for the math problem is k = -5.

Context: The Department of Health and Human Services lost track of nearly 1,500 migrant children it placed with sponsors in the United States, an agency official told a Senate subcommittee Thursday. The children were taken into government care after they showed up alone at the Southwest border. Most of the children are from Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala, and were fleeing drug cartels, gang violence and domestic abuse. The agency learned the 1,475 children could not be found after making follow-up calls to check on their safety, the committee was told. The news has raised concern that the children could fall into the hands of human traffickers or be used as laborers by people posing as relatives. “You are the worst foster parents in the world. You don’t even know where they are,” said Democratic Senator Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota. “We are failing. I don’t think there is any doubt about it. And when we fail kids, that makes me angry.” Since the dramatic surge of border crossings in 2013, the federal government has placed more than 180,000 unaccompanied minors with parents or other adult sponsors who are expected to care for the children and help them attend school while they seek legal status in immigration court. An AP investigation in 2016 found that more than two dozen of those children had been sent to homes where they were sexually assaulted, starved or forced to work for little or no pay. Since then, the Department Health and Human Services has boosted outreach to at-risk children deemed to need extra protection, and last year offered post-placement services to about one-third of unaccompanied minors. But advocates say it is hard to know how many minors may be in dangerous conditions, in part because some disappear before social workers can follow up with them, and they never show up in court. Republican Senator Rob Portman of Ohio gave HHS and the Department of Homeland Security until Monday to deliver a time frame for improving monitoring. “These kids, regardless of their immigration status, deserve to...

Say this using Spanish.","output":"Derrama tu ira sobre los paganos que no te han conocido, y sobre los reinos que no han invocado tu nombre. Esta frase proviene del Salmo 79:6 en la Biblia y es un llamado de justicia a Dios por parte de su pueblo. En este versículo, se pide a Dios que muestre su justicia castigando a los que no lo han reconocido como su creador y no han buscado su guía ni su nombre. La ira y el castigo en este contexto tienen connotaciones religiosas y espirituales, ya que se refiere a las consecuencias divinas de negar a Dios y no seguir sus enseñanzas. La oración en español conserva el significado de la frase original en inglés, manteniendo la esencia religiosa y espiritual que se encuentra en el Salmo. Los \\"paganos\\" y los \\"reinos\\" representan a las personas y naciones que no han puesto su fe en Dios y han seguido otros caminos que han llevado a su separación de él. Esta súplica forma parte del sistema de creencias judeocristiano, en el cual Dios es el creador del universo y el ser supremo que imparte justicia y cuida a su pueblo. La frase en español también refleja la importancia del lenguaje y su impacto en la comprensión de conceptos religiosos y espirituales en diferentes culturas y contextos. En este caso, la traducción al español permite que un hablante nativo de este idioma entienda el mensaje y la enseñanza del versículo bíblico de una manera más clara. A lo largo de la historia, diferentes naciones y grupos religiosos han interpretado estos versículos y pasajes bíblicos de acuerdo a sus propias creencias y circunstancias, y esto sigue siendo cierto hoy en día. Mientras que algunos pueden ver esta súplica como una expresión de justicia divina y un deseo de que aquellos que no siguen a Dios enfrenten las consecuencias de sus acciones, otros pueden interpretarlo como una oportunidad para extender la enseñanza religiosa y ofrecer la salvación a aquellos que no han tenido aún la oportunidad de conocer a Dios. En conclusión, la frase “Derrama tu ira sobre los paganos que no te han conocido, y sobre los reinos que no han invocado tu nombre” en español conserva el mensaje y la importancia religiosa del Salmo 79:6 original en inglés. Esta expresión destaca la necesidad de conocer y seguir a Dios, así como las consecuencias espirituales de no hacerlo, y forma parte del conjunto de enseñanzas y creencias presentes en las tradiciones judeocristianas."},{"instruction":"Q: You will be given a context, a subject and a relation.

Please answer the following question: The answer to the question: What piece did Bizet play the piano version of for a select audience? is inside the article: As life in Paris returned to normal, in June 1871, Bizet's appointment as chorus-master at The Opéra was seemingly confirmed by its director, Émile Perrin. Bizet was due to begin his duties in October, but on 1 November, the post was assumed by Hector Salomon. In her biography of Bizet, Mina Curtiss surmises that he either resigned or refused to take up the position as a protest against what he thought was the director's unjustified closing of Ernest Reyer's opera Erostrate after only two performances. Bizet resumed work on Clarissa Harlowe and Grisélidis, but plans for the latter to be staged at the Opéra-Comique fell through, and neither work was finished; only fragments of their music survive. Bizet's other completed works in 1871 were the piano duet entitled Jeux d'enfants, and a one-act opera, Djamileh, which opened at the Opéra-Comique in May 1872. It was poorly staged and incompetently sung; at one point the leading singer missed 32 bars of music. It closed after 11 performances, not to be heard again until 1938. On 10 July Geneviève gave birth to the couple's only child, a son, Jacques. Bizet's next major assignment came from Carvalho, who was now managing Paris' Vaudeville theatre and wanted incidental music for Alphonse Daudet's play L'Arlésienne. When the play opened on 1 October, the music was dismissed by critics as too complex for popular taste. However, encouraged by Reyer and Massenet, Bizet fashioned a four-movement suite from the music, which was performed under Pasdeloup on 10 November to an enthusiastic reception. In the winter of 1872–73, Bizet supervised preparations for a revival of the still-absent Gounod's Roméo et Juliette at the Opéra-Comique. Relations between the two had been cool for some years, but Bizet responded positively to his former mentor's request for help, writing: \\"You were the beginning of my life as an artist. I spring from you\\".In June 1872, Bizet informed Galabert: \\"I have just been ordered to compose three acts for the Opéra-Comique. [Henri] Meilhac and [Ludovic]..., can you guess it ?

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Are Brandon's cardiac muscles increasing or decreasing in strength?  Hint: In exercises such as weight lifting, skeletal muscle contracts against a resisting force (see Figure below ). Using skeletal muscle in this way increases its size and strength. In exercises such as running, the cardiac muscle contracts faster and the heart pumps more blood. Using cardiac muscle in this way increases its strength and efficiency. Continued exercise is necessary to maintain bigger, stronger muscles. If you don’t use a muscle, it will get smaller and weaker—so use it or lose it. A:","output":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, it can be assumed that Brandon's cardiac muscles are decreasing in strength. This is because he is being sedentary (sitting on the couch playing video games and eating potato chips) instead of engaging in physical activities such as running or weight lifting that would increase the strength and efficiency of his cardiac muscles. It is important to regularly exercise in order to maintain and improve muscle strength, including cardiac muscles.

Jordan says it has carried out 56 airstrikes on Islamic State targets in revenge for the murder of Jordanian pilot Moaz al Kasasbeh. The country's air force chief said the three consecutive days of attacks were 'just the beginning' of campaigns  planned in a bid to avenge the 26-year-old's death. Last week, ISIS released a video purporting to show Kasasbeh being burnt alive in a cage as masked militants in camouflage uniforms looked on. Scroll down for video. Airstrike: Jordan has carried out 56 aerial bombings on Islamic State targets in revenge for the murder of Jordanian pilot Moaz al Kasasbeh. Pictured: Aerial strike from video released last week by officials. Tribute: A plane belonging to the Jordanian Royal Air Force made a deliberate diversion over over the home town of the pilot brutally murdered by ISIS after carrying out airstrikes against the terror group in Syria. Major General Mansour al-Jabour (pictured) said: 'We achieved what we were looking for: revenge for Muath' The act has been widely condemned as among the most sickening ever committed to film and sent waves of revulsion across the Middle East. Today, Major General Mansour al-Jabour said: 'We achieved what we were looking for: revenge for Muath. And this is not the end. This is the beginning.' According to Major General, the strikes - dubbed Operation Martyr Moaz in the pilot's memory - targeted ISIS's weapon depots, training centres, warehouses and military barracks. Jordanian military experts say the kingdom could soon struggle to sustain the intensity of the past few days of air strikes, given the air force only has 40 mid-life F16 jets at its disposal. A squadron of F16 jet fighters from the United Arab Emirates arrived in Jordan on Sunday a day after the Gulf state announced it was being sent to bolster the coalition's military effort. A squadron of United Arab Emirates F-16 fighters has arrived in one of Jordan's air bases to support it in strikes against the Islamic State group. Brutal: ISIS released footage purportedly showing the 26-year-old pilot being burned to death in a cage. Major General Mansour al-Jabour said the strike had 'achieved what we were looking for: revenge for Muath' Looking for revenge: King Abdullah (pictured today with Prince Charles) had vowed to wage a 'harsh' war against ISIS militants who control parts of neighboring Syria and Iraq. It will conduct joint air strikes with Jordanian colleagues against the Islamic militants, Jordanian officials said on Saturday. The focus of Jordan's airstrikes are reported to be Raqqa, the ISIS stronghold in Syria. The intensified air assaults come almost one week after the extremists released the chilling footage, which sparked protests throughout Jordan. Entitled 'Healing the Believers' Chests', the 22-minute film showed the captured airman wearing an orange jumpsuit and being seemingly doused in fuel, as a trail of petrol leading up to the iron bars of the cage is set alight. Officials believe Kasasbeh had been killed almost one month earlier, despite ISIS attempting to carry out a prisoner exchange in return for the stricken pilot. After the footage was released, Jordanian officials promised to retaliate harshly and quickly executed two Iraqi militants connected with ISIS. This included Sajida al-Rishawi, the female would-be suicide bomber whose freedom ISIS had originally demanded in exchange for releasing Kasasbeh. King Abdullah II later said Jordan's response would 'be harsh because this terrorist organisation is not only fighting us, but also fighting Islam and its pure values.' In a statement, he pledged to hit the militants 'hard in the very centre of their strongholds'. Days later, the country released a slickly-edited video showing its war planes being prepared for bombing strikes against ISIS jihadists in Syria. Jordan released a video last week showing its war planes being prepared for bombing strikes against ISIS. The video also featured a pilot holding up a sign that reads: 'And do not think that God is unaware of what the evildoers are doing' - an apparent warning to ISIS militants. The footage, believed to have been broadcast on state TV, was understood to have been recorded at Muwaffaq Salti Air Base and showed troops on plane-mounted missiles before the fleet of fighter jets are launched. The clip shows uniformed people, believed to be members of the Jordanian military, writing messages in Arabic across plane-mounted missiles. One reads 'for you, the enemy of Islam'. ISIS seized control of large areas of Iraq and Syria last year, prompting hundreds of raids by coalition war planes. The United States and several Arab allies, including Jordan, have been striking ISIS in Syria since September 23. Warplanes from the U.S. and other countries have been waging an air campaign against the extremists in Iraq for even longer. The campaign aims to push back the jihadi organisation after it took large parts of Iraq and Syria and declared a 'caliphate.' Al-Jabour said coalition planes have flown 5,500 sorties since the beginning of the air campaign, including 2,000 reconnaissance flights. He did not say whether this included flights over both Syria and Iraq. He said Jordan's air force participated in 946 sorties. The general said about 7,000 Islamic State group militants have been killed since the beginning of the coalition airstrikes.

Q: Passage: Bellinger started in left field in his major league debut on April 25, 2017, against the San Francisco Giants, and had one hit in three at-bats, with an intentional walk. He was just the third Dodgers player in history to be intentionally walked in his debut (Chico Fernández, Dick Nen). Bellinger's first major league hit was an infield single off Neil Ramírez in the ninth inning of the same game. Bellinger hit his first major league home run on April 29 off Zach Eflin of the Philadelphia Phillies and followed that by hitting a second home run in the same game, this one off Héctor Neris. He was just the third Dodgers player with a two–home-run game among his first five starts, joining Charlie Gilbert (1940) and Yasiel Puig (2013). He hit his first grand slam on May 6, off Miguel Díaz of the San Diego Padres, as part of a career-high five RBI day. He was the first Dodgers player to hit five home runs within his first 11 games. Bellinger was named the National League Player of the Week for the first week of May. With nine home runs in May, Bellinger moved into a three-way tie with Joc Pederson (May 2015) and James Loney (September 2007) for most home runs by a Dodgers rookie in a calendar month. He was named the National League Rookie of the Month for May.  Link Information: San Francisco Giants.During the 2016 offseason, Ramírez signed a minor league contract with the San Francisco Giants.

Help as much as you can. Answer the following question: Information:  - Virarajendra Chola (10631070 CE) was one of the most underrated Chola kings, mainly because a major part of his life was spent as a subordinate of his two elder brothers Rajadhiraja Chola I and Rajendra Chola II, who along with Virarajendra Chola himself were the illustrious sons of their Chakravarti(Emperor) father, Rajendra Chola I. While certainly it was not a practice among the Chola kings to nominate the eldest son, but the most capable (in administration of their domains as well as proving their mettle on the battlefield) as the heir to the throne. During his early reign he granted the maintenance of a school to study the Vedas, Sastras and Grammar and a hostel was provided for the students. A hospital named Virasolan was also provided by him for the sick people. The famous grammatical work in Tamil, Virasoliyam was written by Buddhamitra during his reign.  - Rajendra Chola II reigned as the Chola king succeeding his elder brother Rajadhiraja Chola in the 11th century. He is best remembered for his role in the battle of Koppam along with his elder brother where he dramatically turned the tables on the Chalukyan King Someshvara I, after the death of his brother in 1052. During his early reign an expedition was led to Sri Lanka, in the course of which the Sri Lanka army was routed and their king Vijayabahu I of Polonnaruwa was driven to take refuge in a mountain-fortress. He maintained the Chola Empire well as the distribution of his records show that the Chola Empire did not suffer any loss of territory during his reign.  - Rajendra Chola I or Rajendra I was a Chola emperor who is considered one of the greatest rulers and military generals of India. He succeeded his father Rajaraja Chola I in 1014 CE. During his reign, he extended the influence of the Chola empire to the banks of the river Ganga in North India and across the Indian ocean to the West, making the Chola Empire one of the most powerful empires of India. Rajendras conquests included the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, Sri Lanka, Maldives, and he successfully invaded and raided the territories of Srivijaya in Malaysia, Southern Thailand and Indonesia in South East Asia. The Cholas exacted tribute from Thailand and the Khmer kingdom of Cambodia. He defeated Mahipala, the Pala king of Bengal and Bihar, and to commemorate his victory he built a new capital city called Gangaikonda Cholapuram.  - Kpparaksarivarman Rjdhiraja Chla I was an 11th-century emperor of the Indian Chola empire and the successor of his father, Rajendra Chola I. During his long reign, he helped his father conquer many territories and maintained the Chola authority over most of Lanka, Vengi, Kalinga, etc. and the relations with overseas domains despite a series of revolts in the territory. Rajadhiraja Cholas record shows that he was a born fighter who was very capable of maintaining a vast and expansive empire with territories even outside the shores of India. He was a great warrior who always led from the front. His life is a testimony to a king who fought his own wars standing shoulder to shoulder with his men on front lines. He performed the horse sacrifice and earned the title \\"Jayamkonda Cholan\\" (The Victorious Cholan). He was also known as \\"Vijaya Rajendra Cholan\\" (the victorious Rajendra Cholan). One of his predecessors, Rajaraja Chola I also assumed the title Jayangonda Chola towards the \\"end\\" of his reign.  - Athirajendra Chola ( 1070 CE ) reigned for a very short period of few months as the Chola king succeeding his father Virarajendra Chola . His reign was marked by civil unrest , possibly religious in nature , in which he was killed . The Chalukya Chola prince Rajiga succeeded him as Kulothunga Chola I.

Radio Televizioni Shqiptar (RTSH) is the public radio and TV broadcaster of Albania, founded by King Zog in 1938. RTSH runs three analogue television stations as TVSH Televizioni Shqiptar, four digital thematic stations as RTSH, and three radio stations using the name Radio Tirana. In addition, 4 regional radio stations serve in the four extremities of Albania. The international service broadcasts radio programmes in Albanian and seven other languages via medium wave (AM) and short wave (SW). The international service has used the theme from the song \\"Keputa nje gjethe dafine\\" as its signature tune. The international television service via satellite was launched since 1993 and aims at Albanian communities in Kosovo, Serbia, Macedonia, Montenegro and northern Greece, plus the Albanian diaspora in the rest of Europe. RTSH has a past of being heavily influenced by the ruling party in its reporting, whether that party be left or right wing. According to the Albanian Media Authority, AMA, Albania has an estimated 257 media outlets, including 66 radio stations and 67 television stations, with three national, 62 local and more than 50 cable TV stations. Last years Albania has organized several shows as a part of worldwide series like Dancing with the Stars, Big Brother Albania, Albanians Got Talent, The Voice of Albania, and X Factor Albania.

There are three main radio stations using the name Radio Tirana. They also have 4 special corner pieces which are regional radio stations, made to help people living in different parts of the country. So we have to count how many we have in total. Let's count together: First, we have the three Radio Tirana stations - one, two, and three. Now let's add the four corner pieces - four, five, six, and seven.  So, we have 3 + 4 which gives us a total of 7 radio stations in our RTSH toy box.

Problem:Passage: Four religious orders have returned to Norway: the Cistercians, Dominicans, the Poor Clares, and the Trappistines. In 2007, monks from the Abbey of Cîteaux dedicated a new monastery at Frol near Levanger in Nord-Trøndelag, naming it Munkeby Mariakloster. Trappistine nuns, likewise, bought land near the ruins of a pre-Reformation monastery on the island of Tautra in the Trondheimsfjord, moved to the site and built a new cloister, workplace, guesthouse and chapel, calling the new monastery Tautra Mariakloster. In addition to these four, 17 other orders are also working in the country, for instance the Sisters of St. Francis Xavier (Franciskussøstre), which is a unique order as it was founded in Norway in 1901.

Rainier National Park late last week as Karen Sykes, a prominent local hiker and journalist.      Sykes, 70, of Seattle, had been missing for three days when a search for her was suspended Saturday afternoon after the discovery of a body.      The cause of her death, which was ruled an accident, was hypothermia, the Pierce County Medical Examiner’s Office told the Los Angeles Times. Coroner's officials said arteriosclerotic vascular disease, a type of hardening of the arteries, was a contributing factor.      Her boyfriend and hiking partner, Robert Morthorst, declined to comment.      Sykes and Morthorst were on the Owyhigh Lakes Trail on Wednesday night when they found that melting snow had cut off their path, according to a news release from the park.      Sykes went ahead but Morthorst believed the snow made hiking the eight-mile trail too difficult and stayed behind, a park spokeswoman said.      “Ms. Sykes is a very strong hiker and she wanted to go ahead, and her hiking partner had chosen not to hike on the snow, so they agreed to meet each other back at the same point,” said spokeswoman Mimi Gorman, when crews were still searching.      Morthorst reported Sykes missing about 10:45 p.m. Wednesday. Park officials later said she was carrying enough survival gear for one night.      Her death comes less than a month after six climbers trying to reach Mt. Rainier's summit disappeared in late May. All are presumed dead.

(Associated Press)      SEATTLE (AP) — A 70-year-old hiker who died of hypothermia in rugged terrain in Mount Rainier National Park over the weekend was experienced, prepared and knew the mountain well after having written dozens of stories about treks through the area.      She did not have other injuries and her death was an accident, the Pierce County medical examiner's office said Monday. Sykes had heart disease, according to an autopsy, but her daughter and others said she was healthy and fit and often hiked twice a week.      While not certain about the circumstances around her death, those who knew Karen Sykes said earlier that they believe her death was something that could happen to anyone no matter how experienced.      \\"The mountains are big. There's a lot going on. She was extremely experienced but experience has nothing to do with any of it,\\" said Kim Brown, who has hiked with Sykes.      \\"She was very careful, very cautious,\\" Brown said of Sykes, who was prominent in the Northwest hiking community for her trail reviews and photographs and her book on hiking western Washington. \\"It's just something that happens out in the mountains. Everybody who goes in the mountains knows this can happen. It doesn't mean that you shouldn't go out, you need to be aware of it.\\"      Sykes was reported missing late Wednesday when she failed to meet up with her boyfriend as planned during a day hike in the east side of the mountain.      Park officials suspended three-day search efforts on Saturday when they discovered Sykes.      Kindra Ramos, with the nonprofit Washington Trails Association, said she won't guess what happened to Sykes but said hiking comes with some inherent risks.      \\"As they go outdoors, the best thing you could do is to have your 10 essentials, be comfortable with your surroundings, and go as far as you're comfortable,\\" Ramos said.      She recommended proper trip planning and preparation, including reading trip reports and knowing weather conditions.      \\"Karen knew these things and I'm sure did them. She really had her bases covered, and unfortunately accidents happen sometimes,\\" Ramos said. She added that Sykes would want people to know that there are some risks but \\"she wouldn't want to scare people from hiking.\\"      Mary Kay Nelson, executive director of Visit Rainier, an organization that promotes tourism at the mountain, said Sykes was researching a story that she likely would have submitted to the website.      She said Sykes had written about more than 100 hikes in the Rainier area, and \\"was always eager to find new places to go, hidden hikes that weren't well-traveled.\\"      Nelson said her disappearance was particularly shocking because she was so experienced.      \\"It tells us that no matter how prepared we are, accidents happens and things can happen. We need to take outdoor recreation seriously. There's a certain amount of risk every day we get up, whatever we do,\\" she said.      Since 2000, 18 hikers have died in Mount Rainier National Park, including from falls, drowning and heart attacks, according to park statistics.      Annette Shirey, 52, who lives in Tucson, Arizona, said her mother had a personal connection to the mountain and wanted to share that love with others.      \\"The mountains were always a place that gave her strength and was always uplifting for her,\\" she said. \\"It helped restore her spirit and her strength.\\" ||||| Write a summary.","output":"Karen Sykes, a 70-year-old prominent local hiker and journalist, was found dead in Mt.

Question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What were the last names of the two people who were married and McCartney was the best man?, using the article: Harrison married model Pattie Boyd on 21 January 1966, with McCartney serving as best man. Harrison and Boyd had met in 1964 during the production of the film A Hard Day's Night, in which the 19-year-old Boyd had been cast as a schoolgirl. They separated in 1974 and their divorce was finalised in 1977. Boyd said her decision to end the marriage was due largely to George's repeated infidelities. The last infidelity culminated in an affair with Ringo's wife Maureen, which Boyd called \\"the final straw\\". She characterised the last year of their marriage as \\"fuelled by alcohol and cocaine\\", and she stated: \\"George used coke excessively, and I think it changed him ... it froze his emotions and hardened his heart.\\" She subsequently moved in with Eric Clapton, and they married in 1979.Harrison married Dark Horse Records' secretary Olivia Trinidad Arias on 2 September 1978.

He employed ten workers to maintain the 36-acre (15 ha) garden. Harrison commented on gardening as a form of escapism: \\"Sometimes I feel like I'm actually on the wrong planet, and it's great when I'm in my garden, but the minute I go out the gate I think: 'What the hell am I doing here?'\\" His autobiography, I, Me, Mine, is dedicated \\"to gardeners everywhere\\".

Although both sentences discuss events surrounding the largest power outage ever in North America, they focus on different aspects of that event's impact on financial markets. The first sentence primarily discusses the effect of the power outage on U.S. corporate bond yield spreads, noting that they tightened in spotty trading as Wall Street was recovering from the event. This implies that bond market activity and liquidity were somewhat impaired, resulting in these yield spread changes. The second sentence, on the other hand, highlights the impact of the power outage on the U.S. stock market. It notes that stocks rose slightly on feather-light volume, signaling that trading activity was low following the power outage. The focus here is on how the power outage affected stock prices, with an emphasis on the subdued nature of trading during the recovery period. Although both sentences mention Wall Street's efforts to get back on its feet after the power outage, they address different aspects of the financial markets (bonds versus stocks) and provide somewhat different information related to each.

Premise: \\"because parents aren't parents\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"because kids are not being taught by their parents\\" true? Options are: a. yes. b. it is not possible to tell. c. no.","output":"b. it is not possible to tell. The premise \\"because parents aren't parents\\" is somewhat vague and open to interpretation. It implies that there is some deficiency in the parenting role, but doesn't provide specific information about what exactly is lacking. Therefore, it's not possible to conclusively determine if the hypothesis \\"because kids are not being taught by their parents\\" is true based solely on this premise. There could be a variety of reasons why the statement \\"parents aren't parents\\" is made. It could be because some parents may not be performing traditional parenting duties such as nurturing, teaching, or guiding their children. Alternatively, it could refer to the absence of emotional support or the inability of some parents to communicate effectively with their kids. The premise might even refer to parents who outsource most of their parenting responsibilities to others, such as teachers, caregivers, or extended family members. Given the range of possible interpretations, it is not possible to determine without further context whether the hypothesis \\"kids are not being taught by their parents\\" is true. This hypothesis might be accurate in some scenarios, but not in others. For example, if the premise \\"parents aren't parents\\" refers to parents who are disengaged from their children's lives, focusing on their careers, or constantly depending on others to raise their kids, the hypothesis could be true. In this case, the children might not be receiving the necessary guidance and teaching from their parents, which could negatively affect their development. On the other hand, if the premise refers to parents who struggle with communication but still attempt to teach their children, the hypothesis might not be true. It could be that these parents are making efforts to teach their kids, but the message may not come across as effectively as they hope. In this situation, the hypothesis that \\"kids are not being taught by their parents\\" would be inaccurate. In conclusion, without further context or clarification regarding the premise \\"because parents aren't parents\\", it is not possible to decisively determine the truth of the hypothesis \\"because kids are not being taught by their parents.\\""},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

The closest thing to the description this film has is about a Texas family of five struggling to relate and exist together when they are all very different people. They deal with death, fear, growing up, and just making it through a day. However, the story itself is woven into other visuals that make it just a part of what director Terrence Malick is trying to say. If you want something basic, stay away from this movie entirely. But if you're stricken by movies that make you say. \\"Wait, huh?\\" then you should rush out to see it immediately with someone and plan to hold a summit afterward discussing what it means. A Method To His Madness? The loose, disjointed style of the story involved both the 1950s version of the O'Brien family as well as the present-day version of their oldest son Young Jack. There are no solid beginning-middle-ends in any scene; they play out more like a merory or a dream does in your head. Therefore, the audience is left with less of a definitive statement about what's going on, and more of an emotional connection to what they see on screen. We drift through scenes, getting a vague idea that Mr O'Brien is overbearing and Mrs O'Brien is very nurturing , and that the children are growing up with a strong sense of how to move around the imbalance between their parents. Now, throw in scenes of Sean Penn wandering around the high-tech modern city, looking like the rug has been pulled out from underneath his soul. Add in a dash of nature shots, including but not limited to magrna, the ocean, dinosaurs, and hillsides... What Does It All Mean? It is very clear that Malick wants us to have a sense of this family as a part of the entire universe. A child frightened at his father's touch is a microcosm of the dark expanse above our heads, and it exists alongside the tides, animals, and even God. It all depends on what you believe, which is why this movie is so interesting. Question: We can learn from the text that the director cares most about  _  . - something basic that happens in everyday life - how to educate children in different families - something causing people to think and discuss - the importance of protecting endangered anirnals Answer:","output":"From the text, we can learn that the director, Terrence Malick, cares most about something that causes people to think and discuss.

Do those questions have the same meaning? pick from the following. [a]. no; [b]. yes;","output":"[a]. no; The two questions you have provided are related to the Samsung Galaxy J7 but address different issues and do not have the same meaning. Let us elaborate on the two questions for better understanding. 1. What is wrong with my Samsung Galaxy J7 (see details)? This question focuses on identifying potential problems with the Samsung Galaxy J7. In order to provide a helpful response, it would be essential to acquire specific details about the issue(s) encountered. Some common problems that users may experience with the Samsung Galaxy J7 could be related to battery life, software glitches, performance issues, network connectivity, or hardware malfunctions, among others. A useful approach to identifying the particular issue(s) would be to perform troubleshooting steps to narrow down the cause of the problem. These steps may involve: - Force restarting the device - Checking for software updates - Booting the phone in \\"Safe Mode\\" to rule out third-party app interference - Performing a factory reset It's important to note that without details of the actual problem(s) encountered with the Samsung Galaxy J7, it is challenging to provide a specific and accurate solution. 2. What phone network will work for my unlocked Samsung Galaxy J7 HD? This question addresses the compatibility of mobile networks with an unlocked Samsung Galaxy J7 HD. An unlocked device means that it is not tied to a specific carrier and can be used with various service providers. Typically, depending on the region, the Samsung Galaxy J7 HD supports GSM, HSPA, and LTE network technologies. Though, it is essential to consider that there could be regional variations in network compatibility. In practical terms, carriers like AT&T, T-Mobile, and their respective MVNOs (Mobile Virtual Network Operators) should work with the Galaxy J7 HD in the United States, as they utilize the GSM network. In contrast, carriers such as Verizon and Sprint, which primarily rely on the CDMA network, might not be fully compatible with the device. To ensure network compatibility, it is advisable to check the specific network bands (frequencies) supported by the device against the mobile service provider's supported bands. This information is generally available on the carrier's website or through customer support. In conclusion, while these questions both involve the Samsung Galaxy J7, they address distinct issues and thus are not the same. The first question seeks help for identifying potential problems with the device, while the second question revolves around finding compatible mobile networks for an unlocked Samsung Galaxy J7 HD."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: The Norwegian Government is doing its best to keep the oil industry under control. A new law limits exploration to an area south of the southern end of the long coastline; production limits have been laid down (though these have already been raised); and oil companies have not been allowed to employ more than a limited number of foreign workers. But the oil industry has a way of getting over such problems, and few people believe that the Government will be able to hold things back for long. As one Norwegian politician said last week: \\" We will soon be changed beyond all recognition.\\" Ever since the war, the Government has been carrying out a program of development in the area north of the Arctic Circle. During the past few years this program has had a great deal of success. Tromso has been built up into a local capital with a university, a large hospital and a healthy industry. But the oil industry has already started to draw people south, and within a few years the whole northern policy could be in ruins. The effects of the oil industry would not be limited to the north, however. With nearly 100 percent employment, everyone can see a situation developing in which the service industries and the tourist industry will lose more of their workers to the oil industry. Some smaller industries might even disappear altogether when it becomes cheaper to buy goods from abroad. The real argument over oil is its threat to the Norwegian way of life. Farmers and fishermen do not make up most of the population, but they are an important part of it, because Norwegians see in them many of the qualities that they regard with pride as essentially Norwegian. And it is the farmers and the fishermen who are most critical of the oil industry because of the damage that it might cause to the countryside and to the sea. Question: Norwegian farmers and fishermen have an important influence because   _  . - they form such a large part of Norwegian ideal - their lives and values represent the Norwegian ideal - their work is so useful to the rest of Norwegian society - they regard oil as a threat to the Norwegian way of life A:","output":"Norwegian farmers and fishermen have an important influence because their lives and values represent the Norwegian ideal."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

How do astronauts preserve food for long periods of time in space? NASA(the National Aeronautics and Space Administration) has been researching food for space travel since the 1960's to find the best way of keeping astronauts from going hungry. The research could date from an accident that took place on the first manned Gemini mission in 1965. astronaut John Young managed to sneak a corned beef sandwich onto the Geminni III capsule to eat during its orbit around Earth. To Young's surprise, the sandwich plan did not go as expected; instead the sandwich began to break apart and scatter through the Geminni IIIcapsule. This could have resulted in disaster, since a small piece of food could have stuck in the air vents and other equipment. The sandwich was stuffed into a pocket to avoid the further mess inside the small space capsule This incident caused NASA to enforce strict rules on what types of food can be taken into space. Space food has come a long way since then. During the Gemini period, the astronauts mostly ate cubed, compressed foods high in calories and lightweight. NASA expects a long shelf life for space food. The majority of food taken into space has been dried out or heat-treated. These process and use of sodium , make the food taken into space last longer.

This means that they are slowly stepping away and not getting so involved with the things happening there. Just like sometimes, we have to take a step back from a situation and think about it before we join in, the US is doing the same thing in the Mideast. Now, the President in charge of America during this time was named Barack Obama. Mr. Krieg says that he was acting like a \\"lame-duck.\\" This expression means that Obama wasn't able to do as much as before because his time as President was coming to an end, so people didn't listen as much to him.

Imagine you have a team for a school project and some team members aren't working hard. If you become friends with one team member and they help you, it becomes easier to get the others to do their part too. That's what America is trying to do in the Mideast with Tehran.

I start my day with a good breakfast.","output":"In both sentences, the word \\"start\\" is used to indicate the beginning or initiation of something, albeit in slightly different contexts. In the first sentence, \\"Start a new job,\\" the word \\"start\\" is employed as an imperative verb, which means that it is acting as a command or a directive given by one person to another. The speaker is directing someone to begin a new job or encouraging them to kick off a new career or employment opportunity. This could refer to entering a new position, company, or field of work. Additionally, this usage highlights the initiation of a specific event or action. In the second sentence, \\"I start my day with a good breakfast,\\" the word \\"start\\" is used as a simple present tense verb. In this context, it describes a routine action that the speaker usually follows to initiate their day. This statement conveys the idea that the speaker regularly begins their day by having a good breakfast as part of their daily habits. In this case, the word \\"start\\" focuses on a recurring action within the routine practices of an individual rather than highlighting the commencement of a specific event or activity as seen in the first sentence. In summary, while the word \\"start\\" conveys the notion of beginning something in both sentences, the context and the function of the verb differ. In the first sentence, \\"start\\" takes the form of an imperative, addressing a specific initiation of a new job. In contrast, the second sentence uses \\"start\\" in the simple present tense, referring to a repeated action or habit that signifies a consistent way of commencing one's day."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Michael Joseph Jackson was born in Gary, Indiana, near Chicago, on August 29, 1958. He was the eighth of ten children in the Jackson family, a working-class African-American family living in a two-bedroom house on Jackson Street. His mother, Katherine Esther Jackson (née Scruse), played clarinet and piano, had aspired to be a country-and-western performer, and worked part-time at Sears. She was a Jehovah's Witness. His father, Joseph Walter \\"Joe\\" Jackson, a former boxer, was a crane operator at U.S. Steel and played guitar with a local rhythm and blues band, the Falcons, to supplement the family's income. His father's great-grandfather, July \\"Jack\\" Gale, was a Native American medicine man and US Army scout. Michael grew up with three sisters (Rebbie, La Toya, and Janet) and five brothers (Jackie, Tito, Jermaine, Marlon, and Randy). A sixth brother, Marlon's twin Brandon, died shortly after birth.Joe acknowledged that he regularly whipped Michael; Michael said his father told him he had a \\"fat nose\\", and regularly physically and emotionally abused him during rehearsals. He recalled that Joe often sat in a chair with a belt in his hand as he and his siblings rehearsed, ready to physically punish any mistakes. Katherine Jackson stated that although whipping is considered abuse in more modern times, it was a common way to discipline children when Michael was growing up. Jackie, Tito, Jermaine and Marlon have said that their father was not abusive and that the whippings, which were harder on Michael because he was younger, kept them disciplined and out of trouble. In an interview with Oprah Winfrey in 1993, Jackson said that his youth had been lonely and isolating.In 1964, Michael and Marlon joined the Jackson Brothers—a band formed by their father which included Jackie, Tito, and Jermaine—as backup musicians playing congas and tambourine.

Article: You can't always know when there'll be a heavy rain or when to take an umbrella with you. But designer Mikhail Belyaev doesn't think that forgetting to check the weather report before going out should cause you to get wet in the rain. That's why he created the Lampbrella--a lamp post  with its own \\"umbrella\\". The designer says he came up with the idea after watching people get wet on streets in Russia. \\"Once, I was driving on a central Saint Petersburg street and saw people trying to hide from the rain under the street lamps. I thought it would be a good idea to have a Lampbrella built into a street lamp.\\" he said. The Lampbrella is a street lamp fitted with an umbrella canopy . It has an inside electric motor  which can open or close the umbrella freely. The Lampbrella will offer people cover whenever it starts raining. After three minutes of not being used the canopy is closed. According to the designer, the Lampbrella would move at a very low speed in order not to cause harm to people. What's more, it would be grounded to protect from a possible lightning hit. Each Lampbrella would offer enough cover for several people. Being 2 meters off the ground, it would only be a danger for the tallest man. While there are no plans to take the Lampbrella into production , Belyaev says he recently introduced his creation to one Moscow company, and insists his creation could be on any street where a lot of people walk but there are no canopies to provide cover.

Prince Harry during his 10-week spell in Helmand province, Aghanistan. Photograph: AFP/Getty Images      It has never been scared of airing controversial programmes about the royal family – and later this month Channel 4 will broadcast its latest, a dramatised documentary about the hypothetical kidnapping of Prince Harry while on military duty in Afghanistan.      In the 70-minute programme to be shown on 21 October, Harry, played by Sebastian Reid, is kidnapped after the Apache helicopter he is flying crashes, and is then taken to Pakistan. When a British-born fighter recognises him, he is forced to appear in a video for the Taliban demanding troops leave Afghanistan.      Harry is shown appearing on a Taliban video saying: \\"My name is Captain Harry Wales. I'm being fed, I'm comfortable and I'm being looked after very well. The price of my release is that coalition troops must leave Afghanistan, starting immediately. If that does not happen, I will never return home and you will never find my body.\\"      Hamish Mykura, Channel 4's head of documentaries, justified the subject matter by saying it was clear that kidnapping in Afghanistan is on the increase and the Prince would be a target were he to return. \\"It's a very real and live issue and one that we think is well worth exploring.\\"      But while the programme also includes extensive interviews with former intelligence officers, military commanders, negotiators, as well as those who had previously been held hostage – including Guardian journalist Shoaib Sharifi and Jere Van Dyk, the CBS journalist who was held hostage for 45 days in 2008 – Channel 4's approach is likely to raise questions. The programme's focus on Prince Harry will prompt accusations of sensationalism. But the broadcaster says it has acted responsibly and was careful not to show anything on screen that experts did not believe could happen.      It also says it is correct to question whether Britain should allow high-value targets to be on the front line. \\"If you're going to analyse that it's probably a story best told by looking at the number one target in this situation. And Prince Harry is the number one target,\\" Mykura said.      According to Channel 4, the royal family had been informed about the programme, but had not made any response. Today a spokesman for Clarence House said: \\"We're not going to comment on this work of fiction.\\"      Prince Harry served in Afghanistan's Helmand province as a forward air controller for 10 weeks from December 2007. Due to worries that he could become a Taliban target, his presence in the country was kept secret with a news blackout agreed between the UK media and the Ministry of Defence.      The blackout was broken when news aggregator the Drudge Report ran a story about his deployment, and Harry was flown home. Earlier this year, it was reported that the prince wanted to return to Afghanistan to fly the Lynx attack helicopter.      Channel 4 said it had discussed whether The Taking of Prince Harry would \\"simply put ideas into people's heads\\", but decided that there were already websites calling for him to be made a target.      \\"It's clearly not an idea that would be new to the Taliban or al-Qaida or to their supporters,\\" Mykura said.      There will likely be questions, however, about why it was felt necessary to make the programme as a dramatised documentary – with heightened scripted sections between interviews with experts – rather than a more traditional documentary. ||||| PRINCE Harry was last night furious at a new Channel 4 drama that shows him captured by the TALIBAN ï¿½ and turning TRAITOR.      What if? ... Prince Harry on duty      The shock programme later this month sees the soldier prince begging for his life at gunpoint as terrorists video him.

His first lasted just ten weeks amid a media blackout 2ï¿½ years ago to prevent him being a Taliban target ï¿½ until a magazine blew his cover.      The Palace yesterday echoed ex-Chief of the Defence Staff Lord Guthrie who slammed the new \\"docu drama\\" ï¿½ mixing real news footage with fiction ï¿½ as \\"extremely unhelpful for all our soldiers in Afghanistan\\".      It even shows top secret Cobra emergency meetings as the crisis deepens ï¿½ based on info from an army of respected advisers.      They include Richard Kemp, who was commander of British Forces in Afghanistan, and exï¿½Scotland Yard special ops supremo Andy Hayman CBE.      Defiant makers of The Taking Of Prince Harry yesterday insisted threats to kidnap him were \\"already out there\\".      Their programme on October 21 shows him captured after surviving a helicopter crash. A terrorist with a Midlands accent recognises him.      He is sprung from a jail after it is bombed by CIA drones.      An \\"angry\\" Prince Harry was last night said to have \\"no plans\\" to watch it.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: An equilibrium can also be disrupted by the full or partial removal of a reactant or product. If the concentration of a substance is decreased, the system will respond by favoring the reaction that replaces that substance. In the industrial Haber-Bosch process, NH 3 is removed from the equilibrium system as the reaction proceeds. As a result, the forward reaction is favored so that more NH 3 will be produced. The concentrations of N 2 and H 2 decrease. Continued removal of NH 3 will eventually force the reaction to go to completion until all of the reactants are used up. If either N 2 or H 2 were removed from the equilibrium system, the reverse reaction would be favored, and the concentration of NH 3 would decrease.  Jennifer and Justin are examining the principle of chemical equilibrium in their second year organic chemistry course. They are performing a reaction that involves hydrogen gas and glucose as the starting reactants, and the products formed in the reaction are carbon dioxide and oxygen gas. Jennifer and Justin add the materials, and then wait until the reaction has reached equilibrium. Afterwards, Jennifer removes glucose from her reaction mixture, while Justin removes carbon dioxide from his reaction mixture.  Which person's reaction, Jennifer's or Justin's, will begin producing more carbon dioxide? Answer:","output":"In this scenario, Jennifer and Justin are conducting a chemical reaction with hydrogen gas and glucose as reactants and carbon dioxide and oxygen gas as products. They both wait until the reaction reaches equilibrium before proceeding with their modifications. Jennifer removes glucose, one of the reactants, while Justin removes carbon dioxide, one of the products. According to Le Chatelier's principle, if a change is applied to a system at equilibrium, the system will adjust itself to reduce the effect of that change. In the case of Jennifer, by removing glucose (a reactant), the reaction will try to replenish the lost reactant. Thus, the reaction will shift in the direction of the reactants, consuming more hydrogen gas and producing less carbon dioxide and oxygen gas. On the other hand, when Justin removes carbon dioxide (a product), the reaction will try to restore the balance by producing more of the removed product. Hence, the reaction will shift in the direction of the products, consuming more hydrogen gas and glucose and producing more carbon dioxide and oxygen gas. In conclusion, Justin's reaction will begin producing more carbon dioxide as his modification causes the reaction to shift towards the products in order to counteract the removal of carbon dioxide."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article:I can't quite believe it, because I am a 43-year-old mum-of-three. And until eight months ago, I hadn't taken part in any regular physical exercise for 10 years. But on Sunday, after two months of training, and in full view of the public, I wore a sparkly leotard, and danced and tumbled my way round a gymnasium. I could have tramped around the mat dressed as a pantomime horse and still won It seems so preposterous - particularly the leotard. But it happened. Me, on a podium, with a gold medal around my neck after winning Women's Artistic Gymnastics Novice in the 17th Pat English Scottish Formers Championships. Admittedly there were no other competitors in the over-40s novice category. I could have tramped around the mat dressed as a pantomime horse and still won. But this is a mere detail for me. I have achieved my sporting career highlight - long after I had forgotten I actually had a sporty side. I was one of those girls at school who relished cross-country running around the rugby fields. I enjoyed getting up early on cold Saturdays for hockey games played on unforgiving blaes pitches. And outside school, for three years I trained three times a week at a local gymnastics club, before switching my passion and time to ballet for another five years. But after I left school, my sporting career pretty much fell off a cliff. When the hare-brained idea of entering an adults gymnastics competition recently entered my mind - I thought it would be a story focused on experiencing the joys of glory long after I believed possible. What I didn't expect to find is that the actual highs have come from having a new hobby. Kids seem to instinctively treat sports as hobbies. But as an adult, keeping active can start to feel like an unnecessary evil. I entered a whole new world when I took up gymnastics, and initially I wasn't sure I would fit in. Luckily my friend Nicola, a lapsed gymnast and fellow mum, persuaded me to persevere. And thankfully, the gymnastics/parkour/martial arts freestyle folk at our local gymnastic club's adult sessions didn't laugh at the sight of two middle-aged women practising forward-rolls and cartwheels. Anyway, 60-year-old Peter Duncan (the action man of Blue Peter during my childhood) had already demonstrated that it was not too late for me to take up gymnastics. The former children's TV presenter recently took part in the BBC's celebrity Tumble programme. My new world kept getting bigger. Peter Duncan's Tumble partner, Kate McWilliam, turned out to be a coach at a couple of classes I attended at a local circus school. Then my daughter's gymnastics club let me and my friend Nicola use their gym a couple of times to practise our floor routines, and one of the coaches helped me develop my skills. And hobbies, it turns out, don't stop at the gym door, they spill out into pubs and restaurants for obligatory nights out (and medal celebrations). Of course, the journey to that podium moment has been about developing my strength and flexibility and overcoming fear when trying new tumbles. But it's also been about discovering a ready-made community, which reaches out with help, support and enthusiasm to new recruits who \\"get\\" their passion. As for my daughters, they seem completely unfazed about me doing gymnastics. I may have unwittingly led them to believe that sport is a fun and integral part of life, and not some metaphorical ogre that adults must fight. I'll take the gold medal for that alone! If you want to try gymnastics have a look at the Get Inspired page on the sport. Summarize the main points of that article.","output":"The article is about a 43-year-old mother of three who, after a long absence from sports, decided to take up gymnastics and ended up winning a gold medal in Women's Artistic Gymnastics Novice at the 17th Pat English Scottish Formers Championships.

A loan is a debt provided by an entity (organization or individual) to another entity at an interest rate, and evidenced by a promissory note which specifies, among other things, the principal amount of money borrowed, the interest rate the lender is charging, and date of repayment. A loan entails the reallocation of the subject asset(s) for a period of time, between the lender and the borrower.  - Tertiary education, also referred to as third stage, third level, and post-secondary education, is the educational level following the completion of a school providing a secondary education. The World Bank, for example, defines tertiary education as including universities as well as institutions that teach specific capacities of higher learning such as colleges, technical training institutes, community colleges, nursing schools, research laboratories, centers of excellence, and distance learning centers. Higher education is taken to include undergraduate and postgraduate education, while vocational education and training beyond secondary education is known as \\"further education\\" in the United Kingdom, or \\"continuing education\\" in the United States.  - Higher education, post-secondary education, or third level education is an optional final stage of formal learning that occurs after completion of secondary education. Often delivered at universities, academies, colleges, seminaries, and institutes of technology, higher education is also available through certain college-level institutions, including vocational schools, trade schools, and other career colleges that award academic degrees or professional certifications. Tertiary education at non-degree level is sometimes referred to as further education or continuing education as distinct from higher education.  - Continuing education (similar to further education in the United Kingdom and Ireland) is an all-encompassing term within a broad list of post-secondary learning activities and programs. The term is used mainly in the United States and parts of Canada. Recognized forms of post-secondary learning activities within the domain include: degree credit courses by non-traditional students, non-degree career training, workforce training, formal personal enrichment courses (both on-campus and online) self-directed learning (such as through Internet interest groups, clubs or personal research activities) and experiential learning as applied to problem solving.  - Secondary education normally takes place in secondary schools, taking place after primary education and may be followed by higher education or vocational training. In some countries, only primary or basic education is compulsory, but secondary education is included in compulsory education in most countries. In post-Soviet countries it is also known as general education or general middle education.  - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union.  - Further education (often abbreviated FE) in the United Kingdom and Ireland, similar to continuing education in the United States, is a term used to refer to education (in addition to that received at secondary school), that is distinct from the higher education offered in universities and also some FE colleges. It may be at any level in compulsory secondary education, from entry to higher level qualifications such as awards, certificates, diplomas and other vocational, competency-based qualifications (including those previously known as NVQ/SVQs) through awarding organisations including City and Guilds, Edexcel (BTEC) and OCR. In addition, HE qualifications are often provided such as HNC, HND, Foundation Degree or PGCE.

This summer the British driving test celebrates its seventy-fifth birthday.It's often described as one of the most frightening tests we face.     It is a painful experience that doesn't come very cheap nowadays.Taking the test in 1935 cost just 37. 5 pence;now candidates can expect to pay PS93.     The test is also harder than ever.In 1935,the pass rate was 63%; now it's 43%.In recent years,the DSA--the organization that oversees   the driving test -- has looked for ways to assess different aspects of what makes a good driver Now the DSA has announced that candidates will drive for ten minutes without detailed instructions from the examiner.DSA'S chief driving examiner Trevor Wedge said the aim was to measure a candidate's ability to drive safely while making decisions independently. However,drivers will not be punished for getting lost. \\"Candidates won't be failed for going off route,\\" Mr. Wedge said. No doubt there will still be complaints. The BBC has learnt that in 2009 there were l,889 complaints about examiners,of which just 51 were supported. Complaints that were rejected included ''Candidate crashed during test--claims examiner distracted \\" and \\"Candidate says examiner took her on busy roads during rush hour,which was unfair\\".

Their claim centered on a four-note sequence in \\"The World Is Not Enough\\" which they alleged was identical to part of \\"This Game We Play\\". When the songwriters were gathering evidence, one posed as an employee of composer James Horner to contact Don Black and solicit his services for Ocean's Eleven.

Write a text based on \\"muted reaction to breakup ruling\\" Text:","output":"Title: A Muted Reaction to the Breakup Ruling: The Unexpected Calm Amidst the Storm Introduction In a world where breakups within high-profile companies and conglomerates usually shake the business landscape, evoke strong emotions, and prompt heated debates, it is rather surprising to witness a rather lukewarm response to a recent breakup ruling. The muted reaction has left onlookers and industry experts scratching their heads, trying to decipher the reasons behind the unexpected calm. Background and Context The anticipated breakup ruling came as a result of regulatory authorities assessing the monopolistic practices of a major conglomerate operating in the technology, entertainment, and communication sectors. Over the past few years, the conglomerate has been scrutinized for dominating the market, suppressing competition, and violating consumer rights through exploitative pricing. Expected Repercussions Whenever a ruling of this magnitude is announced, one would expect a whirlwind of activity in the market. Such repercussions would typically involve stock market fluctuations, where share prices of directly affected or associated companies could soar or plummet. This would also subsequently impact the investments of stakeholders who have invested heavily in these enterprises. The public, consumers, and investors would all seek answers and assurance regarding the potential impact of such a ruling on their lives and businesses. However, the reactions to this particular breakup ruling have been anything but typical. The stock market reaction has been relatively stable with minor fluctuations. Investors seem unfazed by the announcement and the general public appears to be indifferent. Media coverage, although present, is not as intense as one would have expected, and the overall response appears to be lackluster.  Possible Reasons for the Muted Reaction 1. Timing and Fatigue: The ruling arrives amid the backdrop of a saturated news environment. The world has experienced a series of shocking events, such as pandemics, political turmoil, climate change effects, and economic crises. The general public might be overwhelmed and desensitized to yet another major event. 2. Long Gestation Period: The process leading to the breakup ruling has been a long and public affair, with the conglomerate's transgressions and regulatory authorities' investigations well-documented over time. The unsurprising nature of the ruling may have diminished its shock value and the resultant reactions. 3. Limited Immediate Impact: While the breakup ruling will have long-term effects on the conglomerate and associated industries, its direct immediate consequences may not have been acutely felt by the general public, especially considering the company's size and its diverse portfolio of products and services. The breakup could appear more as a structural reshuffling, rather than a dramatic overhaul directly affecting consumers at the ground level. 4. Faith in Market Resilience: Given the resilience of the market in recent times, investors and the public may not be too worried about the impact of the breakup ruling on the market. Instead, they might consider the event as an opportunity for market correction and the emergence of new players. Conclusion While the muted reaction to the breakup ruling has caught many off-guard, it could simply be a reflection of the times we live in. The rapid succession of global events and the pre-existing knowledge of the breakup scenario may have muted the otherwise typical reactions to such a ruling. As the dust around the announcement settles, it remains to be seen how the conglomerate, associated industries, and the general public will respond and adapt to the new landscape shaped by this transformative ruling."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","output":"Hello there! I'm going to explain these two questions for you. Remember, sometimes our body needs a superhero to help take care of it and be strong. Cortisol is like one of those superheroes that live in our body and help us when we are stressed. Sometimes we need more of it, and sometimes we need less of it. That's why the answers are different. Let me tell you what you can do in each case. Question 1: To increase cortisol levels, you might do the following: 1. Wake up early: When you wake up early, the sun tells your body it's time to wake up, and your cortisol superhero gets to work. 2. Exercise: When you play or do sports, your body sends a message that it needs more energy and your cortisol superhero helps. 3. Get excited or a little stressed: When you get excited, like before a big game, your body needs help from your superheroes, and the cortisol superhero is one of them. Question 2: To reduce cortisol levels, you can try: 1. Relaxing: This is like giving a break to your superheroes. You can relax by listening to soft music, taking a nap, or going for a walk. 2. Breathing: Taking deep breaths can help calm you down and put your cortisol superhero to more rest. 3. Eating well and sleeping well: A healthy snack and a good night's sleep will help keep all your superheroes, including cortisol, happy and strong.

The opening soprano solo in E major, \\"I know that my Redeemer liveth\\" is one of the few numbers in the oratorio that has remained unrevised from its original form. Its simple unison violin accompaniment and its consoling rhythms apparently brought tears to Burney's eyes. It is followed by a quiet chorus that leads to the bass's declamation in D major: \\"Behold, I tell you a mystery\\", then the long aria \\"The trumpet shall sound\\", marked pomposo ma non-allegro (\\"dignified but not fast\\"). Handel originally wrote this in da capo form, but shortened it to dal segno, probably before the first performance. The extended, characteristic trumpet tune that precedes and accompanies the voice is the only significant instrumental solo in the entire oratorio. Handel's awkward, repeated stressing of the fourth syllable of \\"incorruptible\\" may have been the source of the 18th-century poet William Shenstone's comment that he \\"could observe some parts in Messiah wherein Handel's judgements failed him; where the music was not equal, or was even opposite, to what the words required\\". After a brief solo recitative, the alto is joined by the tenor for the only duet in Handel's final version of the music, \\"O death, where is thy sting?\\"  The melody is adapted from Handel's 1722 cantata Se tu non-lasci amore, and is in Luckett's view the most successful of the Italian borrowings. The duet runs straight into the chorus \\"But thanks be to God\\".The reflective soprano solo \\"If God be for us\\" (originally written for alto) quotes Luther's chorale Aus tiefer Not. It ushers in the D major choral finale: \\"Worthy is the Lamb\\", leading to the apocalyptic \\"Amen\\" in which, says Hogwood, \\"the entry of the trumpets marks the final storming of heaven\\". Handel's first biographer, John Mainwaring, wrote in 1760 that this conclusion revealed the composer \\"rising still higher\\" than in \\"that vast effort of genius, the Hallelujah chorus\\".

As you know, the prizes were started by a Swede called Alfred Nobel. He was born in Stockholm, the capital of Sweden. Alfred Nobel was a great scientist. He made two important inventions, and so he became very rich. Although he was rich, Nobel was not a happy man. He never married or had children. Also, he was a sick man during his large part of life. When he died at the age of 63, he left a fund of 9,000,000. The money was to be used in giving prizes to those who made great achievements in physics, chemistry , medicine and literature , and for world peace. The first Nobel Prizes were given on December 10, 1901, five years after Nobel's death. Since then many famous people from all over the world have been given Nobel Prizes for their achievements. Each prize has three parts. The first part is a gold medal. Second, a winner of a Nobel Prize is given a certificate saying that he has been given the prize. The third part of the prize is a large amount of money-about 40,000. Often a prize is given to just one person, but not always. Sometimes a prize is shared. It may be given to two or more people who have worked together. It is also sometimes true that a prize is not given at all if there is no great achievement.

Wear Orange was inspired by friends of Hadiya Pendleton, a 15-year-old Chicago high school student killed by gunfire in 2013. The group decided to honor her life by wearing orange — the color worn by hunters in the woods to protect themselves and others. While the idea has been embraced by civic organizations, politicians and celebrities, it has been rejected by gun rights advocates. The National Rifle Association has attacked the campaign as \\"pointless,\\" and said \\"participating is an easy way of scoring points for being 'socially conscious.'\\" Here is a look at the unique relationship between Americans and their guns. Any law-abiding citizen in the United States is allowed to own or carry a gun. That right comes from the U.S. Bill of Rights and the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. It says: \\"A well-regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.\\" The Second Amendment was based partially on English common law, which describes an auxiliary right, supporting the natural rights of self-defense, resistance to oppression, and the civic duty to act in concert in defense of the state. To purchase a gun in the majority of states, a person needs to be of age, pass the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check and fill out a firearms transaction record. However, background checks are not currently required for private sales, including those conducted at gun shows. Certain people are banned from owning weapons, including convicted criminals, people with mental health illnesses or non-U.S. citizens. But the system has major holes in it. Question: What is likely true about the politics regarding gun rights in the US? Options:  A. not enough information  B. Many individuals have varying opinions regarding what should be done about the shootings in the US.  C. It is heavily divided and contended among citizens and politicians.  D. Most of the citizens that own guns feel threatened about the notion of new laws calling for gun control. A:","output":"C.

Powerball jackpot rises to 600 million, with cash value of 377 million. No one matched winning numbers in Wednesday night's Powerball drawing. Largest jackpot in U.S. history was 656 million in Mega Millions game in 2012. Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Title: Powerball Jackpot Soars to 600 Million, Nearing Record-Breaking U.S. Lottery Prize Introduction: The Powerball jackpot has risen steeply in recent days, now reaching a staggering 600 million due to no one matching the winning numbers in Wednesday night's drawing. With a cash value of 377 million, this jackpot has tickled the fancy of not only regular Powerball players but also those who rarely take part in this chance-based game. As the prize pool grows, it nears the record-breaking jackpot set by the Mega Millions game back in 2012 at 656 million.  Why this matters: (Reason: Inform the public about the substantial jackpot available) The significant increase in the Powerball jackpot has gained much public attention, as it offers a life-changing sum for those who choose to participate. With such a tremendous prize at stake, even the most casual lottery players find themselves enticed by the possibility of winning the vast fortune. As the jackpot continues to grow, more people are expected to join in on the chance to win. Comparing the two jackpots: (Reason: Put the current jackpot into context) As the Powerball prize pool edges closer to the record-breaking 656 million Mega Millions jackpot from 2012, it is worth considering how the two games compare. While the Mega Millions jackpot earned the title of the largest jackpot in U.S. history, the current Powerball jackpot shows potential to surpass this milestone if no winners emerge in the upcoming draws. Odds of winning: (Reason: Guide the audience to understand their chances of winning the jackpot) While the impressive jackpot may be enough to sway some people to buy a few extra tickets, it is crucial to remember the odds of winning the grand prize. According to Powerball, the chances of winning the jackpot stand at 1 in 292.2 million. Although the odds may be slim, the anticipation and possibility of a life-altering win often outweigh the low chances of success for many people. Conclusion: (Reason: Summarize the article and encourage readers to participate if they wish) As the Powerball jackpot surges to a remarkable 600 million, the excitement and buzz around this lottery game continue to grow. While the odds may be long, the dream of winning such wealth keeps players coming back for their chance at a life-changing experience. As the jackpot nears record-breaking status, it remains to be seen if a lucky winner will emerge or if the prize will continue to soar to even greater heights."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Three people inside the helicopter and five people inside The Clutha were killed after the Police Scotland aircraft came down at 22:30 on Friday. A further 14 people are being treated for \\"very serious injuries\\" in hospitals across the city. A major investigation is under way and the Air Accidents Investigations Branch will conduct an inquiry into the crash. Dr Jennifer Armstrong, medical director at NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, said that of the 32 people taken to local hospitals after the crash, 18 had now been treated and discharged. She confirmed that 14 people were still being treated for serious injuries. \\"The main injuries we have seen include chest injuries, head injuries, long-bone fractures and lacerations,\\" she said. It is thought that about 120 people were in the pub at the time of the crash. Many were rescued or escaped but others were trapped by a collapse on the left-hand side of the building. The three occupants of the helicopter who died were two police officers and a civilian pilot. A significant number of personnel from Police Scotland, The Scottish Fire and Rescue Service and Scottish Ambulance Service are still at the scene. Police Scotland Chief Constable Sir Stephen House told a news conference on Saturday afternoon that they would remain there for some time.

The King Street car park next to the scene is full of cars, and buses are passing just 100 yards from the cordon. There is no debris on our side of the cordon - it's hard to believe what has happened just a few yards away. We can see the blue and green tarpaulins on top of the roof of the pub, but there is no activity on that roof. On our side of the cordons, a pack of around 40 journalists and photographers are taking statements from eyewitnesses and waiting for news. He said: \\"This is a complex and ongoing rescue operation. It will not be a quick operation. It is a very complicated and indeed dangerous scene.\\" Chief Constable House said the operation would go on \\"for many days yet\\". He paid tribute to the emergency service personnel who were working at the scene and the people of Glasgow who disregarded their own personal safety to help survivors in the aftermath of the crash. Deputy First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told the same news conference that the increased death toll from the crash was \\"news that everybody today has been both dreading and expecting\\". \\"Our hearts go out to everyone who has been bereaved. It is impossible to imagine the grief and loss that they are experiencing,\\" she said. \\"They should know that the thoughts and prayers of everyone across the city, and indeed across Scotland, are with them at this unimaginably difficult time. Ms Sturgeon also praised the courage and fortitude of the emergency services and people of Glasgow in the aftermath of the crash. She added: \\"I think we were all moved last night by the way in which those who were in and around the scene did everything possible to help and the outpouring of concern and kindness today, I'm sure, will be a comfort to those affected.\\" Scotland's First Minister Alex Salmond earlier described it as a \\"black day for Scotland.\\" Prime Minister David Cameron paid tribute to the bravery of the \\"ordinary Glaswegians\\" who rushed to help.

Myself and others lifted it up and managed to get them out. I spent some time with one injured man.\\" He added: \\"At our side of the pub I would say there were less than 10 people injured, mainly walking wounded, not seriously injured.

Everyone helped everyone else to get out.\\" The Clutha: 'Very much a family bar' 'Utter disbelief' in Glasgow About 250 people attended a special service at St Andrew's Cathedral on Saturday afternoon. Archbishop Philip Tartaglia told worshipers: \\"We pray for those who have lost their lives, who are injured, the bereaved, and the emergency services and members of the public. \\"We pray for our city of Glasgow, which is in mourning today.\\" A statement posted on The Clutha bar's Facebook page on Saturday stated: \\"Our thanks go out to all the goodwill messages and prayers for those who tragically lost their lives in the accident last night.

Some societies, such as America and Australia for example, are mobile and very open. People here change jobs and move house quite often. As a result, they have a lot of relationships that often last only a short time, and they need to get to know people quickly. So it's normal to have friendly conversations with people that they have just met, and you can talk about things that other cultures would regard as personal. On the other hand there are more crowded and less mobile societies where long-term relationships are more important. A Malaysian or Mexican business person, for example, will want to get to know you very well before he or she feels happy to start business. But when you do get to know each other, the relationship becomes much deeper than it would in a mobile society. To Americans, both Europeans and Asians seem cool and formal at first. On the other hand, as a passenger from a less mobile society puts it, it's no fun spending several hours next to a stranger who wants to tell you all about his or her life and asks you all sorts of questions that you don't want to answer.

Question: what order was amended and superseded by Executive order 11246? Context: Ideas for affirmative action came as early as the Reconstruction Era (1865-1877) in which a former slave population lacked the skills and resources for sustainable living. In 1865, General William Tecumseh Sherman proposed to divide the land and goods from Georgia and grant it to families of color which became the \\"Forty acres and a mule\\" policy. The proposal was never widely adopted due to strong political opposition. Nearly a century later (1950s-1960s), policies to assist classes of individuals reemerged during the Civil Rights Movement. The civil rights guarantees came through the interpretation of the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment. The decisions came to be known as affirmative action in which mandatory, as well as voluntary programs, affirmed the civil rights of people of color. Furthermore, these affirmative action programs protected people of color from the present effects stemming from past discrimination. In 1961, President John F. Kennedy became the first to utilize the term \\"affirmative action\\" in Executive Order 10925 to ensure that government contractors \\"take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed, and employees are treated during employment, without regard to their race, creed, color, or national origin.\\" This executive order realized the government's intent to create equal opportunities for all qualified people. This executive order was eventually amended and superseded by Lyndon B. Johnson's Executive Order 11246 which prevented discrimination based on race, color, religion, and national origin by organizations which received federal contracts and subcontracts. In 1967, the order was amended to include sex as well. The Reagan administration was opposed to the affirmative action requirements of Executive Order 11246, but these contemplated changes[which?] faced bi-partisan opposition in Congress.

Write some highlights for the following article: Manuel Neuer is the ultimate 'sweeper-keeper' and now seems to want to spend more time outside his area than inside it. Germany's No 1 could be found nearer the halfway line during Bayern Munich's 0-0 draw with Hamburg on Saturday. As the match neared its conclusion, Neuer came to clear a loose ball but instead of hacking it away he took on not one but two opponents. VIDEO: Scroll down to see Manuel Neuer make a save near the half-way line on Saturday. Manuel Neuer's loose touch left him scrambling against Julian Green, forcing the keeper to make a save. Unfortunately for Neuer, the incident happened outside the box, and he received a yellow card. He rounded the first, but came unstuck when a loose touch left him scrambling to reach the ball before the second opposition. He didn't get there in time, and goalkeeping instincts came to the fore as Neuer got down low and stopped the ball with an outstretched arm. Luckily for him and Bayern, he was only given a yellow card, and the match finished 0-0. His reputation as a 'sweeper-keeper' was cemented during the World Cup after his display against Algeria. He regularly found himself sprinting off his line to clear and was ultimately the difference as Germany won 2-1 on their way to lifting the trophy. Neuer reacts after a disappointing 0-0 draw with Hamburg in the Bundesliga on Saturday. A loose touch from the Germany No 1 gifted Hamburg an opportunity. Hamburg players react instantly as the ball strikes Neuer's hand, well outside his 18-yard box.

At one point, he had to run really fast to reach the ball before some other players. He used his hands to stop the ball but was not allowed to do that outside his goal box, so he got a yellow card, which is like a warning. The game ended in a tie, with no goals from either team.

Summarize: While your popcorn garland might seem like the finishing touch to your Christmas tree, it’s actually easier to hang it when there aren’t ornaments in the way. You should add your lights before the garland, though. The best way to hang popcorn strings on your tree is to softly drape them over the branches rather than firmly stuffing them in gaps. Start at the top and carefully work your way down.  For a formal look, make sure to drape your popcorn strings in even, uniform loops. For a more casual look, allow the popcorn strings to drape unevenly. If you want your popcorn garland to stand out on your tree, consider doubling up the strings and draping them together over the branches. Once the popcorn strings are in place, you can hang your ornaments on the tree. However, you should take care when placing them among the garlands because you don’t want any large, heavy ornaments to rest on the popcorn and possibly break it.","output":"To hang a popcorn garland on your Christmas tree effectively, it's important to follow a specific order and technique. Begin by installing the lights on the tree before adding the garland, as this will prevent any interference with the delicate popcorn strings later on. To ensure the most aesthetically pleasing result, focus on gently draping the popcorn strings over the tree's branches opposed to forceful stuffing into gaps. Start from the top of the tree and methodically progress downwards, taking care to preserve the popcorn's shape and integrity. Depending on your desired look, you can either create a formal or casual aesthetic. For a formal appearance, arrange the popcorn strings into even, uniform loops across the branches. Alternatively, for a more relaxed and informal design, let the popcorn strings drape unevenly and more organically.  If you'd like the popcorn garland to be more prominent on your tree, consider doubling up the strings so that they appear thicker and more noticeable when draped on the branches. After you've carefully positioned the popcorn strings, you can then move on to hanging your ornaments. However, it's crucial to be cautious when adding ornaments near the garlands, as heavy or large ornaments may cause damage to the popcorn if they rest directly on it. By following these steps, you will achieve a beautiful Christmas tree adorned with an exquisite popcorn garland that adds a charming, festive touch to your holiday decorations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Which brother studied more about how rocks usually move several centimeters?  Hint: Almost all earthquakes occur at plate boundaries. All types of plate boundaries have earthquakes. Convection within the Earth causes the plates to move. As the plates move, stresses build. When the stresses build too much, the rocks break. The break releases the energy that was stored in the rocks. The sudden release of energy creates an earthquake. During an earthquake the rocks usually move several centimeters or rarely as much as a few meters. Elastic rebound theory describes how earthquakes occur ( Figure below ).

Article: STOCKHOLM - Mo Yan, the 2012 Nobel Prize winner for literature, said on Friday that diversity in global cultures makes human beings' cultural life interesting. Mo told a reception in the Chinese Embassy in Stockholm that it was a responsibility to protect the diversity in cultures while creating the diversity as well. He said that translation played a very important role in bridging different cultures, adding that without the translators who had translated his books he couldn't have won the Nobel Prize. \\"I think translation is much harder than writing itself,\\" said Mo Yan, explaining that it only took 43 days to write the work Life and Death Are Wearing Me Out, while it took Swedish sinologist Anna Gustafsson Chen six years to translate the work. Earlier in the day he visited a Swedish middle school, where about 20 Swedish students who were studying Chinese welcomed him by singing the theme song in the movie \\"Red Sorghum\\" which was based on his novel of the same name. \\"Unlike the rough and husky voice in the movie, the Swedish students presented the song with a gentle and soft voice, making it rather a romantic song,\\" Mo told the gathering at the Chinese Embassy. He said he hoped that there were going to be some outstanding translators among the students, adding that meeting them made him \\"extraordinarily happy.\\" He said language was going to be \\"the most reliable way\\" for interaction between peoples because one had to know the language of a nation to understand the people's inner world and spiritual life. Lan Lijun, Chinese Ambassador to Sweden, said that Chinese literature had stepped into the spotlight worldwide after Mo Yan had won the Nobel Prize, which would help contribute to the literature communication and dialogue between China and the rest of the world. People in Sweden and other parts of the world were all welcome to know more about Chinese culture, he added.

Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries.  - The formes fixes ( singular forme fixe , \`\` fixed form '' ) are the three fourteenth - and fifteenth - centuries French poetic forms : the ballade , rondeau and virelai . Each was also a musical form , generally a chanson , and all consisted of a complex pattern of repetition of verses and a refrain with musical content in two main sections . All three forms can be found in thirteenth - century sources but a fifteenth - century source gives Philippe de Vitry as their first composer while the first comprehensive repertory of these forms was written by Guillaume de Machaut . The formes fixes stopped being used in music around the end of the fifteenth century , although their influence continued ( in poetry they , especially the rondeau , continued to be used ) . Sometimes forms from other countries and periods are referred to as formes fixes . These include the Italian fourteenth century madrigal and later ballata and barzelletta , the German bar form , Spanish 13th century cantiga , and the later canción , and villancico .  - A chanson (\\"song\\", from Latin \\"cantio\\", gen. \\"cantionis\\") is in general any lyric-driven French song, usually polyphonic and secular. A singer specializing in chansons is known as a \\"chanteur\\" (male) or \\"chanteuse\\" (female); a collection of chansons, especially from the late Middle Ages and Renaissance, is also known as a chansonnier.  - Poetry (the term derives from a variant of the Greek term, \\"poiesis\\", \\"making\\") is a form of literature that uses aesthetic and rhythmic qualities of languagesuch as phonaesthetics, sound symbolism, and metreto evoke meanings in addition to, or in place of, the prosaic ostensible meaning.  - Latin (Latin: ) is a classical language belonging to the Italic branch of the Indo-European languages. The Latin alphabet is derived from the Etruscan and Greek alphabets.  - A refrain (from Vulgar Latin \\"refringere\\", \\"to repeat\\", and later from Old French \\"refraindre\\") is the line or lines that are repeated in music or in verse; the \\"chorus\\" of a song. Poetic fixed forms that feature refrains include the \\"villanelle\\", the \\"virelay\\", and the \\"sestina\\".  - The Late Middle Ages or Late Medieval Period was the period of European history generally comprising the 14th and 15th centuries (c. 13011500). The Late Middle Ages followed the High Middle Ages and preceded the onset of the early modern era (and, in much of Europe, the Renaissance).  - A sestina (Old Occitan: \\"cledisat\\" ; also known as \\"sestine\\", \\"sextine\\", \\"sextain\\") is a fixed verse form consisting of six stanzas of six lines each, normally followed by a three-line envoi. The words that end each line of the first stanza are used as line endings in each of the following stanzas, rotated in a set pattern.  - Vulgar Latin or Sermo Vulgaris (\\"common speech\\") is a generic term for the \\"nonstandard\\" (as opposed to \\"classical\\") sociolects of Latin from which the Romance languages developed. Works written in Latin during classical times used Classical Latin rather than Vulgar Latin, with very few exceptions (most notably sections of Gaius Petronius' \\"Satyricon\\"). Because of its nonstandard nature, Vulgar Latin had no official orthography. Vulgar Latin is sometimes also called colloquial Latin, or Common Romance (particularly in the late stage). In Renaissance Latin, Vulgar Latin was called \\"vulgare Latinum\\" or \\"Latinum vulgare.\\"  - Old French (', ', \\"\\"; Modern French ) was the Gallo-Romance dialect continuum spoken from the 9th century to the 14th century.  In the 14th century, these dialects came to be collectively known as the \\"langues d'oïl\\", contrasting with the \\"langue d'oc\\" or Occitan language in the south of France. The mid-14th century is taken as the transitional period to Middle French, the language of the French Renaissance, specifically based on the dialect of the Île-de-France region.  - Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound and silence, which exist in time. The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the \\"color\\" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek  (\\"mousike\\"; \\"art of the Muses\\"). In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form include the production of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as \\"the harmony of the spheres\\" and \\"it is music to my ears\\" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, \\"There is no noise, only sound.\\"  - A song, most broadly, is a single (and often standalone) work of music that is typically intended to be sung by the human voice with distinct and fixed pitches and patterns using sound and silence and a variety of forms that often include the repetition of sections. Written words created specifically for music or for which music is specifically created, are called lyrics. If a pre-existing poem is set to composed music in classical music it is an art song. Songs that are sung on repeated pitches without distinct contours and patterns that rise and fall are called chants. Songs in a simple style that are learned informally are often referred to as folk songs. Songs that are composed for professional singers who sell their recordings or live shows to the mass market are called popular songs. These songs, which have broad appeal, are often composed by professional songwriters, composers and lyricists. Art songs are composed by trained classical composers for concert or recital performances. Songs are performed live and recorded on audio or video (or in some, cases, a song may be performed live and simultaneously recorded). Songs may also appear in plays, musical theatre, stage shows of any form, and within operas.  - A chansonnier (, Galician and , ) is a manuscript or printed book which contains a collection of chansons, or polyphonic and monophonic settings of songs, hence literally \\"song-books,\\" although some manuscripts are so called even though they preserve the text but not the music (for example, the Cancioneiro da Vaticana and Cancioneiro da Biblioteca Nacional, which contain the bulk of Galician-Portuguese lyric). The most important chansonniers contain lyrics, poems and songs of the troubadours and trouvères of the Middle Ages. Prior to 1420, many song-books contained both sacred and secular music, one exception being those containing the work of Guillaume de Machaut. Around 1420, sacred and secular music was segregated into separate sources, with large choirbooks containing sacred music, and smaller chansonniers for more private use by the privileged. Chansonniers were compiled primarily in France, but also in Italy, Germany and in the Iberian peninsula.  - A villanelle (also known as \\"villanesque\\") is a nineteen-line poetic form consisting of five tercets followed by a quatrain. There are two refrains and two repeating rhymes, with the first and third line of the first tercet repeated alternately until the last stanza, which includes both repeated lines. The villanelle is an example of a fixed verse form. The word derives from Latin, then Italian, and is related to the initial subject of the form being the pastoral.  - The Renaissance was a period in European history, from the 14th to the 17th century, regarded as the cultural bridge between the Middle Ages and modern history. It started as a cultural movement in Italy in the Late Medieval period and later spread to the rest of Europe, marking the beginning of the Early Modern Age.  - A virelai is a form of medieval French verse used often in poetry and music. It is one of the three \\"formes fixes\\" (the others were the ballade and the rondeau) and was one of the most common verse forms set to music in Europe from the late thirteenth to the fifteenth centuries.    After reading the paragraphs above, choose the best answer for the entity that related to 'formes fixes' with the relationship of 'subclass of'.

Formes fixes, including the ballade, the rondeau, and the virelai, are types or subclasses of medieval French poetry. Each of these forms was characterized by specific rules concerning the structure of stanzas and the repetition of verses or refrains, reflecting the broader definitions and characteristics of poetry as a genre of literature that uses aesthetic and rhythmic qualities of language to evoke meanings. Poetry features a significant variety of forms and styles, of which formes fixes are a particular category or subclass, noted for their historical development during the 14th and 15th centuries in France."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Gary Mulholland of The Observer considers the release of Is This It a \\"world-changing moment\\" and notes that its impact was \\"immediate and dramatic\\" on both music and attire. BBC Radio 1's Zane Lowe suggests that the album moved popular opinion from DJs and pop music to \\"skinny jeans and guitars\\", \\"the template for rock 'n' roll in the modern day\\". Tam Gunn of FACT agrees and explains that it \\"caused a sea change\\" in mainstream music in the US and the UK, while Anthony Miccio of Stylus points out that the Strokes' success created the commercial context for \\"other new-wavers\\" to flourish. Rolling Stone writes that Is This It inspired \\"a ragged revolt\\" in Britain, led by the Libertines and Arctic Monkeys, and continued its influence in the US on the success of bands like Kings of Leon. The Observer shares a similar view and concludes that \\"a fine brood of heirs\\", like the Libertines and Franz Ferdinand, would not have existed and been successful if the Strokes had not reinvigorated \\"rock's obsession with having a good time\\". Jared Followill of Kings of Leon notes that the album was one of the main reasons that he wanted to get into a band; he states, \\"The title track was one of the first basslines I learned ... I was just 15 at the time.\\"Jed Gottlieb of the Boston Herald argues that, although Is This It provided substantial musical influence, its biggest success was in revamping the music industry and making A&R delegates scout and promote alternative bands.

They cannot travel through empty space. This was demonstrated in the 1600s by a scientist named Robert Boyle. Boyle placed a ticking clock in a sealed glass jar. The clock could be heard ticking through the air and glass of the jar. Then Boyle pumped the air out of the jar. The clock was still running, but the ticking could not be heard. Thats because the sound couldnt travel without air particles to transfer the sound energy. Is there any other place where sound cannot be heard? Here is a hint: is there any other place that does not have air molecules? Thats right, in space sound cannot be transferred. So can astronauts hear each other? Yes, they can, because they are in enclosed space stations or pressurized suits.In both cases, they are surrounded by air molecules. If they left their space ship and did not use their electronics, they would not be able to hear each other. Next time you watch a science fiction movie, think about this factoid.

It is one of the seven uniformed services of the United States and is designated as the Army of the United States in the United States Constitution, Article 2, Section 2, Clause 1 and United States Code, Title 10, Subtitle B, Chapter 301, Section 3001. As the largest and senior branch of the U.S. military, the modern U.S. Army has its roots in the Continental Army, which was formed (14 June 1775) to fight the American Revolutionary War (17751783)before the U.S. was established as a country. After the Revolutionary War, the Congress of the Confederation created the United States Army on 3 June 1784, to replace the disbanded Continental Army. The United States Army considers itself descended from the Continental Army, and dates its institutional inception from the origin of that armed force in 1775.  - The United States Air Force (USAF) is the aerial warfare service branch of the United States Armed Forces and one of the seven American uniformed services. Initially part of the United States Army, the USAF was formed as a separate branch of the military on 18 September 1947 under the National Security Act of 1947. It is the most recent branch of the U.S. military to be formed, and is the largest and one of the world's most technologically advanced air forces. The USAF articulates its core functions as Nuclear Deterrence Operations, Special Operations, Air Superiority, Global Integrated ISR, Space Superiority, Command and Control, Cyberspace Superiority, Personnel Recovery, Global Precision Attack, Building Partnerships, Rapid Global Mobility and Agile Combat Support.  - The United States Armed Forces are the federal armed forces of the United States. They consist of the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard. The President of the United States is the military's overall head, and helps form military policy with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), a federal executive department, acting as the principal organ by which military policy is carried out. From the time of its inception, the military played a decisive role in the history of the United States. A sense of national unity and identity was forged as a result of victory in the First Barbary War and the Second Barbary War. Even so, the Founders were suspicious of a permanent military force. It played an important role in the American Civil War, where leading generals on both sides were picked from members of the United States military. Not until the outbreak of World War II did a large standing army become officially established. The National Security Act of 1947, adopted following World War II and during the Cold War's onset, created the modern U.S. military framework; the Act merged previously Cabinet-level Department of War and the Department of the Navy into the National Military Establishment (renamed the Department of Defense in 1949), headed by the Secretary of Defense; and created the Department of the Air Force and National Security Council.  - The National Security Act of 1947 was a major restructuring of the United States government's military and intelligence agencies following World War II. The majority of the provisions of the Act took effect on September 18, 1947, the day after the Senate confirmed James Forrestal as the first Secretary of Defense.    After reading the paragraphs above, we are interested in knowing the entity with which 'ivor parry evans' exhibits the relationship of 'conflict'. Find the answer from the choices below.  Choices: - american civil war  - american revolutionary war  - cold war  - first barbary war  - second barbary war  - world war ii Answer:","output":"Ivor Parry Evans was a United States Air Force officer and commander. The United States Air Force (USAF) was formed as a separate branch of the military on 18 September 1947 under the National Security Act of 1947. Since the USAF was created after World War II and during the onset of the Cold War, it is most likely that Ivor Parry Evans exhibited the relationship of 'conflict' with the Cold War.

Can we infer the following? Chapter 16 starts by describing the events that took place on a Sunday. Choices: (i). Yes. (ii). It's impossible to say. (iii). No. The answer is:","output":"(iii). No. The text specifically mentions that the events of Chapter 16 took place on a Friday, not a Sunday. Thus, we can infer that the statement provided is incorrect. It is not possible to infer that Chapter 16 starts by describing the events that took place on a Sunday because the text clearly states \\"Friday was a comfortable day in the household of King.\\" Furthermore, the events of this chapter seem to revolve around storytelling by the Story Girl, and the overall good humor in the King household. The range of stories mentioned, from Eastern myth to anecdotes of Carlisle workaday folks, suggest an atmosphere of imagination, conviviality, and familial interaction. Nonetheless, the day on which these events occur is distinctly stated as Friday. There is no ambiguity or uncertainty in the time reference provided in the text. Consequently, the notion that they happened on a Sunday is not supported or inferred from the information provided in the text. The text does not provide information on whether similar events occur on a Sunday or any other day of the week, therefore it is not possible to make assumptions or inferences outside of this specified day. Without additional information or context, the explicit mention of \\"Friday\\" as the day in question refutes the statement that Chapter 16 describes events occurring on a Sunday."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Premise: yeah i didn't realize that Hypothesis: I finally realized it just now.  Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","output":"To analyze whether the premise entails the hypothesis, we first need to understand the context and meaning of both statements. Let's break them down and examine them closely. Premise: \\"Yeah, I didn't realize that.\\" In this statement, the speaker acknowledges that they were unaware of a particular piece of information or a fact. They may or may not indicate when they became aware of it, but it is clear that they realized their lack of knowledge at some point. Hypothesis: \\"I finally realized it just now.\\" This statement refers to the speaker's gaining of insight or awareness about the previously unknown fact. They specify that the realization happened at the present moment (\\"just now\\"). The use of \\"finally\\" suggests that this realization may have been expected to happen eventually or that the person might have struggled with understanding the information before. Now, let's examine whether the premise entails the hypothesis. An argument's premise entails its conclusion if the truth of the premise guarantees the truth of the conclusion, making it impossible for the premise to be true without the conclusion also being true. In this case, the premise acknowledges the speaker's past state of being unaware of a fact, while the hypothesis focuses on the present moment and the actual realization of that fact. The two statements are related but do not guarantee the truth of each other. It is theoretically possible for the person to have been unaware of the information (premise) but not necessarily have the realization at the specific moment indicated in the hypothesis. However, there is a close relationship between the premise and hypothesis, and both statements suggest that the speaker has experienced a change in their understanding. The premise may not strictly entail the hypothesis, but the hypothesis can be conceived as a logical progression based on the premise. The speaker's prior lack of understanding (premise) could naturally lead to the moment of realization (hypothesis), especially when considering additional context, such as a conversation or experience that helped this realization to occur. In conclusion, while the premise does not strictly entail the hypothesis, there is a logical progression from one statement to the other. The relationship between the two statements makes it reasonable to believe that the speaker once did not understand the fact but has since come to understand it."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: Every chemical reaction occurs with a concurrent change in what?    Choices:  - neutrons  - mass  - hydrogen  - energy  A: Answer:","output":"Every chemical reaction occurs with a concurrent change in energy. Step 1: Understand the question The question is asking for the common factor that changes during a chemical reaction, and provides four choices. Step 2: Analyze each choice - Neutrons: Neutrons are subatomic particles in the nucleus of atoms, and chemical reactions involve electrons and breaking/making of chemical bonds. Therefore, change in the number of neutrons is not relevant in a chemical reaction. - Mass: The mass doesn't change in a chemical reaction, as the Law of Conservation of Mass states that mass is conserved during a chemical reaction. - Hydrogen: While hydrogen may be involved in some chemical reactions, it is not always present in every reaction. - Energy: During chemical reactions, energy is either released (exothermic reaction) or absorbed (endothermic reaction) as bonds are broken and new ones are formed. Step 3: Choose the correct answer Based on the analysis, energy is the concurrent change in every chemical reaction."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Would \\"Farmington Hills consistently ranks as one of the safest cities in the United States , as well as in the state of Michigan.\\" be a reasonable answer? A:","output":"Farmington Hills, MI is located in Oakland County.  Regarding whether \\"Farmington Hills consistently ranks as one of the safest cities in the United States, as well as in the state of Michigan\\" is a reasonable answer, it depends on the context. If the question is focused on the safety aspect of Farmington Hills, this statement can be a part of the response. It is important, however, to provide sources or statistical data to support the claim. Farmington Hills indeed has a reputation for being a safe city. Factors contributing to this distinction include the city's low crime rates, good education system, and efforts by local law enforcement to maintain order and security. Additionally, the strong sense of community, well-maintained infrastructure, and numerous recreational options make the city an attractive place to live. The Farmington Hills Police Department adheres to the community policing philosophy, engaging in proactive measures to prevent crime and resolve public safety concerns. Officers work closely with local organizations, businesses, schools, and community members to foster a safe environment. In recent years, various surveys and reports have highlighted the safety of Farmington Hills. For example, SafeWise, a home safety and security resource, ranked the city among the top 25 safest cities in Michigan in its annual report. Other sources, such as AreaVibes, have also given Farmington Hills high safety ratings based on factors like crime rates and police presence. Education plays a key role in the perception of Farmington Hills' safety. The city is part of the award-winning Farmington Public Schools district, which provides quality education and numerous resources for students and their families. The dedication to education within the community can contribute to lower crime rates and a sense of stability. Furthermore, Farmington Hills has a wealth of recreational facilities and community centers that promote a healthy and active lifestyle. These facilities include parks, trails, golf courses, public pools, ice arenas, and more. The availability of resources for residents to engage in leisure activities and build community bonds has a positive impact on the overall safety and well-being of the city. In conclusion, the statement claiming that Farmington Hills consistently ranks as one of the safest cities in the United States and in Michigan has merit. However, to make the answer more substantial, it is crucial to support the statement with reliable sources or statistical data, especially when addressing specific safety concerns or factors contributing to the city's safety reputation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Is the premise \\"Two sumo wrestlers wrestling in a sand ring.\\" true if \\"There is a international sumo match going on.\\"?","output":"The premise \\"Two sumo wrestlers wrestling in a sand ring\\" cannot be directly confirmed or disproved solely based on the information \\"There is an international sumo match going on.\\" Here's why: 1. Sumo Wrestling and its Environment: Traditional sumo wrestling, a competitive full-contact wrestling sport that originated in Japan, typically takes place in a circular ring known as a \\"dohyo.\\" The ring is not made of sand, but instead of clay and covered in a layer of sand. 2. International Sumo Matches: If there is an international sumo match going on, it would logically follow that there are at least two sumo wrestlers wrestling each other. However, details about the specific environment or ring in which they are wrestling are not provided in the statement. 3. Sand Ring: Sumo wrestling traditionally occurs in a dohyo, not a \\"sand ring.\\" Thus, the premise \\"Two sumo wrestlers wrestling in a sand ring\\" seems to deviate from the norms of traditional sumo wrestling. However, this doesn't mean it's impossible. Untraditional matches could take place in a sand ring, though this would be unusual and is not suggested by the information given. In conclusion, though it is plausible that two sumo wrestlers could wrestle in a sand ring (perhaps under special or nontraditional circumstances), it is not possible to verify or falsify this purely from the information that an international sumo match is taking place. More specific data about the location and conditions of the match would be required. Furthermore, considering the traditional norms of sumo wrestling which use a dohyo instead of a simple sand ring, the original premise seems unlikely in the context of a formal international sumo match."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Off the coast of which county would you find the 'Goodwin Sands'????","output":"The Goodwin Sands is a 10-mile-long sandbank located off the coast of Kent, a county in southeastern England. It lies about six miles east of the town of Deal and is situated in the English Channel, which separates the United Kingdom from continental Europe. This submerged sandbank has caused numerous shipwrecks throughout history due to its notorious and treacherous nature. Formed by the deposition of sediment carried by river channels and tidal currents, Goodwin Sands serves as a crucial natural habitat for many marine species. It is home to an array of fauna like seals, crustaceans, mollusks, and different fish species. Additionally, the sandbank significantly contributes to the coastal defense of Kent. The sands help break up incoming waves that would otherwise erode the coastline along Deal, Ramsgate, and Kingsdown. The Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) operates a lifeboat station in Ramsgate, as the ever-shifting sands make navigation in the area dangerous, especially for inexperienced sailors. The Goodwin Sands have been claimed to be one of the \\"shipwreck capitals\\" of the world, with over 2,000 shipwrecks documented across the centuries. Aside from its environmental and maritime significance, Goodwin Sands has an interesting history. From the 13th century, the sandbank was mentioned in tales of folklore, including the legend of the lost city of Lomea, which is believed to have been swallowed by the sands. Goodwins also played a role in major conflicts, such as the Battle of Goodwin Sands in 1652 during the First Anglo-Dutch War. Moreover, it served as a hiding spot for British submarines in World War II and a graveyard for several downed military aircraft. Overall, the Goodwin Sands sandbank, off the coast of Kent County in southeastern England, constitutes an essential ecological site and historically significant location. It is a noteworthy feature of the English Channel that continues to draw attention for its perilous disposition and rich maritime history."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What may happen after they miss the deadline ?","output":"After missing the deadline, several consequences and scenarios may unfold depending on the nature, importance, and context of the deadline in question. Since it is not specified what type of deadline was missed in the article, I will provide a general overview of potential outcomes. 1. Missed Opportunities: One of the most immediate effects of missing a deadline is the potential loss of opportunities related to the task or project. This might mean missing out on business deals, job offers, or collaborations that could have arisen if the deadline was met. 2. Damage to Reputation: Constantly missing deadlines could lead to a negative perception of the person's work ethic, professionalism, and reliability. Such a damaged reputation may result in difficulty securing new jobs and projects, or maintaining professional relationships. 3. Strained Relationships: Whether the deadline involved personal commitments or professional collaboration, missing deadlines can strain relationships with colleagues, friends, or family members who were relying on the individual to meet their commitments. This strain may lead to long-term damage or loss of trust. 4. Additional Stress and Workload: Missing a deadline often means having to put in extra hours to catch up on the missed task, along with handling other tasks that continue to come in. The additional workload could lead to increased stress and burnout. 5. Financial Consequences: In some cases, missing a deadline could result in financial penalties, such as late fees or having to pay compensation to other parties who were affected by the delays. 6. Lowered Productivity: When a deadline is missed, it may cause other tasks and projects to be delayed, potentially creating a domino effect on productivity. This negatively affects the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the individual or team involved. To cope with and recover from missing a deadline, the person should take immediate and appropriate actions such as: 1. Communicate with those affected: It is crucial to notify the relevant stakeholders about the missed deadline and explain the reasons behind it. This shows a sense of responsibility and can help maintain trust. 2. Develop a plan to catch up: The person should create a recovery plan with revised deadlines and priorities. This will help ensure timely completion of the delayed task as well as upcoming tasks. 3. Learn from the experience: Analyze why the deadline was missed (e.g., poor time management, overcommitment, or procrastination) and develop strategies to avoid similar issues in the future. 4. Make amends: Depending on the nature of the deadline, offering an apology or compensating for any consequences due to the delay may help maintain the relationships involved. 5. Establish a more realistic timeline in the future: When committing to future deadlines, it is essential to consider the lessons learned from the missed deadline and set more achievable goals. In conclusion, missing a deadline can lead to various negative outcomes, including missed opportunities, a damaged reputation, strained relationships, additional workload, financial penalties, and lowered productivity.

The findings suggest there may be some scientific basis to the \\"5 second rule\\" --- the belief about it being fine to eat food that has only had contact with the floor for five seconds or less. Although people have long followed the 5 second rule, until now it was unclear whether it actually helped. The study, undertaken by final year Biology students and led by Anthony Hilton, Professor of Microbiology at Aston University, monitored the transfer of the common bacteria from a variety of indoor flooring types (carpet, cement floor etc.) to toast, pasta, a biscuit and a sticky sweet when contact was made from 3 to 30 seconds. The results showed that: Time is a significant factor in the transfer of bacteria from a floor surface to a piece of food; and the type of flooring the food has been dropped on has an effect, with bacteria least likely to transfer from carpeted surfaces and most likely to transfer from cement flooring surfaces to moist  foods making contact for more than 5 seconds. Professor Hilton said: \\"Consuming food dropped on the floor still carries an infection risk as it very much depends on which bacteria are present on the floor at the time.\\" The Aston team also carried out a survey of the number of people who employ the 5 second rule. The survey showed that: 87% of people surveyed said they would eat food dropped on the floor, or already have done so. 55% of those who would eat or have eaten food dropped on the floor are women. 81% of the women who would eat food from the floor would follow the 5 second rule.

Remy gave candy to their friends when they were at their house.  Given the context: What will Remy want to do next?  Possible answers: have fun, ask about their friends, Hard to understand Answer:","output":"Based on the given context, it can be concluded that Remy has a friendly and generous personality since they are giving candy to their friends. Although it is hard to predict exactly what Remy wants to do next, we can deduce the most probable course of action based on their behavior and potential social scenarios. One possibility is that Remy aims to have fun with their friends. Sharing candy could be Remy's way of initiating a social gathering or a casual hangout. Remy might want to engage in conversation, play games, watch a movie, or partake in other enjoyable activities with their friends. Bonding over shared experiences strengthens relationships and creates lasting memories. Thus, having fun could be Remy's primary objective in this situation. Another plausible scenario is that Remy wants to show genuine interest and concern for their friends by asking about their lives, problems, and achievements. This act of caring can reinforce their relationships and foster a sense of camaraderie. Remy might inquire about their friends' work, studies, hobbies, or family life, or converse about recent experiences and future plans. By being an attentive listener and offering support or advice, Remy can convey empathy and nurture their friendships. Additionally, Remy's next course of action might not be explicitly stated in the given context. It could be a combination of both having fun and asking about their friends. It is also possible that Remy has a specific reason for the candy-sharing gesture, such as celebrating an achievement or commemorating a special occasion. In such cases, their subsequent actions would be aligned with the event's purpose. In conclusion, while it is challenging to pinpoint Remy's precise intentions, we can infer that their next actions are likely motivated by a desire to bond with their friends and create an enjoyable atmosphere. Therefore, engaging in fun activities and showing concern for their friends are the most probable outcomes based on the given context."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the title of this article: After the consulship had been opened to the plebeians, the plebeians were able to hold both the dictatorship and the censorship. Plebiscites of 342 BC placed limits on political offices; an individual could hold only one office at a time, and ten years must elapse between the end of his official term and his re-election. Further laws attempted to relieve the burden of debt from plebeians by banning interest on loans. In 337 BC, the first plebeian praetor was elected. During these years, the tribunes and the senators grew increasingly close. The senate realised the need to use plebeian officials to accomplish desired goals. To win over the tribunes, the senators gave the tribunes a great deal of power and the tribunes began to feel obligated to the senate. As the tribunes and the senators grew closer, plebeian senators were often able to secure the tribunate for members of their own families. In time, the tribunate became a stepping stone to higher office.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: I have a new situation: Gary, a high school student, is supposed to be studying two different cells under a microscope during his biology class. Gary doesn't like biology class at all though and can't find the motivation to look at the cells in detail. In his homework where students are supposed to write what they observed, Gary simply wrote down the first thing he saw under the microscope which was that Cell A is larger than cell B. It won't get him a great grade, but Gary is hoping it will at least get him a pass on the assignment.  But I can use this background: As a cell grows, its volume increases more quickly than its surface area. If a cell was to get very large, the small surface area would not allow enough nutrients to enter the cell quickly enough for the cell’s needs. This idea is explained in Figure below . However, large cells have a way of dealing with some size challenges. Big cells, such as some white blood cells, often grow more nuclei so that they can supply enough proteins and RNA for the cell’s requirements. Large, metabolically active cells often have lots of cell protrusions, resulting in many folds throughout the membrane. These folds increase the surface area available for transport of materials into or out of the cell. Such cell types are found lining your small intestine, where they absorb nutrients from your food through protrusions called microvilli .  What is an answer for this question: Does Cell A or Cell B have more folds across the membrane? Answer:","output":"To determine whether Cell A or Cell B has more folds across the membrane, we must first consider the available information and background knowledge provided in the situation. Gary, the high school student, only provided one observation: Cell A is larger than Cell B. While this information is limited, we can use the background knowledge on cell growth, surface area, and the strategies cells employ to deal with size challenges to reason about which cell might have more folds across the membrane. As mentioned in the background information, as a cell grows, its volume increases more quickly than its surface area. As a result, large cells may not have a sufficient surface area to allow the efficient transport of nutrients and materials in and out of the cell. Therefore, large cells have developed adaptations to overcome this limitation, such as acquiring more nuclei or increasing the number of folds across the membrane. These folds, such as microvilli, can be found in highly active cells like those lining the small intestine. Considering this information, we can make an educated guess that the larger Cell A may have more folds across the membrane compared to the smaller Cell B. The reason is that larger cells, like Cell A, need to compensate for their limited surface area compared to their volume to maintain the efficient transport of nutrients and materials. This is achieved by increasing the number membrane folds, which increases the surface area for transport. It is important to note that it's impossible to provide a definitive answer based on the single observation from Gary that Cell A is larger than Cell B. A more detailed analysis of the cells under the microscope would need to be performed to accurately identify the number of membrane folds in each cell. However, with the limited information provided, our best-educated guess is that larger Cell A might have more membrane folds than Cell B as part of its adaptive strategies."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the question: I know that the answer to the question \\"What is significant about birds??\\" is in \\"Ninety-five percent of bird species are socially monogamous. These species pair for at least the length of the breeding season or—in some cases—for several years or until the death of one mate. Monogamy allows for both paternal care and biparental care, which is especially important for species in which females require males' assistance for successful brood-rearing. Among many socially monogamous species, extra-pair copulation (infidelity) is common. Such behaviour typically occurs between dominant males and females paired with subordinate males, but may also be the result of forced copulation in ducks and other anatids. Female birds have sperm storage mechanisms that allow sperm from males to remain viable long after copulation, a hundred days in some species. Sperm from multiple males may compete through this mechanism. For females, possible benefits of extra-pair copulation include getting better genes for her offspring and insuring against the possibility of infertility in her mate. Males of species that engage in extra-pair copulations will closely guard their mates to ensure the parentage of the offspring that they raise.\\". Can you tell me what it is? The answer is:","output":"The significant aspect about birds mentioned in the passage is that 95% of bird species are socially monogamous. These species form pairs for at least the breeding season, sometimes for several years or until one mate dies.

Separate the eggs: First, crack your eggs and separate the egg whites from the yolks. Put the egg whites in one bowl and the yolks in another. 2. Beat the egg whites: Using a whisk or an electric mixer, beat the egg whites until they become foamy and form soft peaks. This will make the omelette spongier because the beaten egg whites will trap air, making the omelette fluffy. 3. Mix yolks, flour, and milk: In the bowl with the egg yolks, add a little bit of flour and some milk. Mix everything together until it is smooth. This mixture will make your omelette spongier because the flour will help it hold its shape and the milk will make it tender. 4. Combine the mixtures: Gently fold the beaten egg whites into the yolk, flour, and milk mixture. Be very careful not to overmix, as this could cause your omelette to be less spongy. 5. Cook the omelette: Heat a non-stick pan or a greased skillet over medium heat. Pour the mixture into the pan and cook the omelette until it's golden brown on both sides and cooked through.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which farmer observed a greater buildup of calcium in the soil?  Hint: Precipitation in grasslands is equal to or less than evapotranspiration and causes soil development to operate in relative drought. Leaching and migration of weathering products is therefore decreased. Large amounts of evaporation causes buildup of calcium (Ca) and other large cations flocculate clay minerals and fulvic acids in the upper soil profile. Impermeable clay limits downward percolation of water and fulvic acids, reducing chemical weathering and podzolization. The depth to the maximum concentration of clay increases in areas of increased precipitation and leaching. When leaching is decreased, the Ca precipitates as calcite (CaCO3) in the lower soil levels, a layer known as caliche.

I thought I had moved past it for the most part, thanks to supportive family and lots of counseling and medication to treat my treatment resistant depression I’ve struggled over the last 25 years. I will be 40 this year. My son, the oldest, turned 15 this year … the same age I was when it began. I see how young he is and recognized for the first time just how young I had been when I was abused. That was really hard for me, emotionally. Now, I look at my two girls, ages 9 and 3, and worry for their safety - probably more than I should, but understandable given what I went through. We have had lots of “body safety” talks and my older daughter understands the very basics of what I went through, mainly because I have spent a great part of this past year writing a memoir about my experiences and have begun speaking publicly about what I went through and what it means to be a survivor. This is challenging because it’s hard to talk about and explain to a child in a way that they understand without making them fear the world. I struggle with this often. I’ve chosen to use it as an opportunity to teach them about activism and the power of speaking the truth, what it means to be a survivor instead of a victim.

In Thailand , you do n't normally bring a present for the bride and groom . However , you can give some money . You put this in the same envelope that you received your invitation . This already has your name on it . Question: What may be the reason for giving a bride and groom money for their wedding ?","output":"There are several reasons why giving a bride and groom money for their wedding is a common practice in Thailand, as well as in many other cultures around the world. Some of the reasons include the following: 1. Financial Assistance: Weddings can be an expensive endeavor, and providing monetary gifts can help the couple offset the costs associated with the event. This assistance can be especially meaningful in Thailand, where families might not have as much disposable income, and it can be seen as a way for guests to show their appreciation and support for the couple as they start their new life together. 2. Cultural Significance: In Thai culture, giving money at a wedding signifies the guest's respect and wishes for prosperity and good fortune for the couple. It is considered a blessing and symbolizes the transfer of positive energy and wealth from the guest to the newlyweds, as they embark on their journey together. 3. Flexibility: Money as a gift provides the couple with the flexibility to use it according to their needs and preferences. This can be particularly useful for newlywed couples setting up their new home or planning their honeymoon. Monetary gifts allow them to prioritize their spending on what matters the most to them, which may be different for each couple. 4. Convenience: For guests, giving money can be both convenient and practical, as they may not have the time or resources to find the perfect gift for the bride and groom. Additionally, it helps to eliminate the possibility of the couple receiving duplicate items, which they might have to return or exchange. 5. Traditional Rituals: In some instances, the giving of money during a Thai wedding can also be linked to specific ceremonial customs, such as the \\"Sinsod\\" or dowry that is given by the groom to the bride's family. This can involve a negotiation of a sum, and the money is then presented during the wedding ceremony as a symbol of the groom's commitment to care for his new wife and her family. In conclusion, giving money as a gift to the bride and groom in a Thai wedding reflects a combination of cultural significance, practicality, and a desire to contribute to the couple's financial stability as they start their married life together. It is embraced as a thoughtful and meaningful gesture by both the couple and their guests, demonstrating a deep connection and respect for the traditions and values that shape Thai marriages."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Manchu (Manchu: manjU; Mollendorff: manju; Abkai: manju; simplified Chinese: Man Zu ; traditional Chinese: Man Zu ; pinyin: Manzu; Wade-Giles: Man3-tsu2) are an ethnic minority in China and the people from whom Manchuria derives its name. They are sometimes called \\"red-tasseled Manchus\\", a reference to the ornamentation on traditional Manchu hats. The Later Jin (1616-1636), and Qing dynasty (1636-1912) were established by Manchus, who are descended from the Jurchen people who earlier established the Jin dynasty (1115-1234) in China. Manchus form the largest branch of the Tungusic peoples and are distributed throughout China, forming the fourth largest ethnic group in the country. The early phase of Manchu clothing succeeded from Jurchen tradition. White was the dominating color. To facilitate convenience during archery, the robe is the most common article of clothing for the Manchu people. Over the robe, a surcoat is usually worn, derived from the military uniform of Eight Banners army. During the Kangxi period, the surcoat gained popularity among commoners. The modern Chinese suits, the Cheongsam and Tangzhuang, are derived from the Manchu robe and surcoat which are commonly considered as \\"Chinese elements\\".  Wearing hats is also a part of traditional Manchu culture, and Manchu people wear hats in all ages and seasons in contrast to the Han Chinese culture of \\"Starting to wear hats at 20 year-old\\" (Er Shi Shi Guan ), . Manchu hats are either formal or casual, formal hats being made in two different styles, straw for spring and summer, and fur for fall and winter. Casual hats are more commonly known as \\"Mandarin hats\\" in English.  Manchus have many distinctive traditional accessories. Women traditionally wear three earrings on each ear, a tradition that is maintained by many older Manchu women. Males also traditionally wear piercings, but they tend to only have one earring in their youth and do not continue to wear it as adults. The Manchu people also have traditional jewelry which evokes their past as hunters. The fergetun (fergetUn), a thumb ring traditionally made out of reindeer bone, was worn to protect the thumbs of archers. After the establishment of the Qing dynasty in 1644, the fergetun gradually became simply a form of jewelry, with the most valuable ones made in jade and ivory.

David (; ; \\"Dawid\\"; ; ; Gəˁəz: Dawit; possibly meaning \\"beloved one\\") was the second king of the United Kingdom of Israel and Judah, according to the Hebrew Bible.  In the biblical narrative, David is a young shepherd who first gains fame as a musician and later by killing Goliath. He becomes a favorite of King Saul and a close friend of Saul's son Jonathan. Worried that David is trying to take his throne, Saul turns on David. After Saul and Jonathan are killed in battle, David is anointed as King. David conquers Jerusalem, taking the Ark of the Covenant into the city, and establishing the kingdom founded by Saul. As king, David arranges the death of Uriah the Hittite to cover his adultery with Bathsheba. The text does not state whether she consented to sex. According to the same biblical text, God denies David the opportunity to build the temple and his son, Absalom, tries to overthrow him. David flees Jerusalem during Absalom's rebellion, but after Absalom's death he returns to the city to rule Israel. Before his peaceful death, he chooses his son Solomon as his successor. He is mentioned in the prophetic literature as an ideal king and an ancestor of a future Messiah, and many psalms are ascribed to him. 1. What Gəˁəz: Dawit means? 2. Who was David? 3.

A: The answer is:","output":"During diastole, the elastic walls of the arteries relax and expand. Diastole is the phase of the cardiac cycle when the heart relaxes and fills with blood. This relaxation occurs after the heart contracts or beats (called systole) to pump blood out to the body. When the ventricles of the heart are in the process of relaxation (diastole), blood pressure in the large arteries decreases. As a result, the elastic walls of the arteries expand to accommodate the reduced pressure and store the blood that was ejected during systole. This expansion of the artery walls helps to maintain a relatively constant blood flow and pressure throughout the arterial system. The elastic properties of the arteries play a crucial role in the circulation of blood by acting as a shock absorber and a reservoir to maintain blood pressure during the different phases of the cardiac cycle. This ensures that oxygen and nutrients continue to be delivered to the organs and tissues, even when the heart is in its resting phase."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Options: - food - specialty store - christmas tree - department store - christmas stocking  The answer is \\"christmas tree\\" because The answer is:","output":"\\"christmas tree\\" because: Step 1: Analyze the given options and their relevance to the question. In this case, the question is about providing a great gift for a poor family in December, specifically aiming at providing decorations. The given options are food, specialty store, christmas tree, department store, and christmas stocking. Step 2: Eliminate irrelevant options. The first step is to eliminate options that do not directly fulfill the requirement of being a decoration. - Food: While food is essential for a family's survival especially in a time of need, it does not serve as a decoration for the festive season. - Specialty store and Department store: These are both places to buy items, not actual gifts or decorations themselves. Therefore, they can be eliminated. Step 3: Compare the remaining options. At this point, we have two options left - christmas tree and christmas stocking. - Christmas Tree: A Christmas tree is a universally recognized symbol of the December holiday season. It serves as a centerpiece for holiday decorations and offers a sense of festivity and joy. - Christmas Stocking: Although a Christmas stocking is also a part of holiday decorations, it is a much smaller item and may not have the same impact in transforming the atmosphere of the home as a Christmas tree would. Step 4: Choose the best option based on the comparisons. Based on the analysis of the remaining options, a \\"Christmas tree\\" would make the best gift for the poor family, as it is a more prominent decoration associated with December festivities and can significantly uplift the atmosphere of their home during the holiday season."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Both Seti II and Amenmesse have been suggested although the fact that that Siptah later changed his royal name or nomen to Merneptah Siptah after his Year 2 suggests rather than his father was Merneptah. If correct, this would make Siptah and Seti II half-brothers since both of them were sons of Merneptah.   - A sarcophagus (plural, sarcophagi) is a box-like funeral receptacle for a corpse, most commonly carved in stone, and usually displayed above ground, though it may also be buried. The word \\"sarcophagus\\" comes from the Greek \\"sarx\\" meaning \\"flesh\\", and \\"phagein\\" meaning \\"to eat\\", hence \\"sarcophagus\\" means \\"flesh-eating\\"; from the phrase \\"lithos sarkophagos\\". Since \\"lithos\\" is Greek for \\"stone\\", \\"lithos sarcophagos\\" means, \\"flesh-eating stone\\".

She was the Great Royal Wife of Pharaoh Ramesses VI and mother of Pharaoh Ramesses VII, Princess Iset (God's Wife of Amun) and Princes Amenherkhepshef and Panebenkemyt.  - Limestone is a sedimentary rock, composed mainly of skeletal fragments of marine organisms such as coral, forams and molluscs. Its major materials are the minerals calcite and aragonite, which are different crystal forms of calcium carbonate (CaCO).  - Ramesses VI Nebmaatre-Meryamun (also written Ramses and Rameses) was the fifth ruler of the Twentieth dynasty of Egypt who reigned from 1145 to 1137 BC and a son of Ramesses III by Iset Ta-Hemdjert. His royal tomb, KV9, is located near Tutankhamun's tomb in the Valley of the Kings.  - Iset Ta-Hemdjert or Isis Ta-Hemdjert, simply called Isis in her tomb, was an Ancient Egyptian queen of the twentieth dynasty; the Great Royal Wife of Ramesses III and the Royal Mother of Ramesses VI.  - Usermaatre Setepenre Meryamun Ramesses VII (also written Ramses and Rameses) was the sixth pharaoh of the 20th dynasty of Ancient Egypt.

If you want your first kiss to be special, then try picking the person you think would make it the most special. If you're worried that your kissing technique isn't all that great yet, then maybe choose someone you'd be less embarrassed about. (And stop worrying! Kissing is fun once you get the hang of it.)  There's nothing like kissing a real, breathing human being. A person will respond to your lips like a hand or a fruit can't. Kissing comes naturally to humans. That's why we do it! Practicing kissing before you actually kiss is like practicing riding a bike on a seesaw. It doesn't really prepare you for the real deal. You get good at riding a bike by riding a bike, just like you get good at kissing by kissing another person. If you're a girl, you might just be able to go up to a guy and ask him if he wants to kiss. (Or you can develop a friendship with him and if it blossoms into something stronger, kiss him when you're close.) If you're a guy, your job is going to be a bit harder. Look for a good opportunity to kiss someone:  Kiss someone you think is attracted to you. It's hard to know sometimes, but if you know that someone does or doesn't like you, use that information accordingly. Work up to a kiss. Work up to a kiss first by flirting. Touch the person's shoulder gently when you're talking to them; compliment an aspect of their eyes; or stare longingly into their eyes. Be physically close to the person. It'll be awkward if you're five feet away when you move in for a kiss. Get close to the person. Maybe even put your arm around their waist if all the signals you're getting say \\"yes!\\" You want your lips to be supple, soft, and smooth before you kiss. Balm your lips regularly before you kiss so that they're free of dry, flaky skin that can distract from the moment. Remember:   Do not apply lip-gloss before you kiss. Lip-gloss can be sticky, glittery, and sweet. You don't want the sticky, your partner doesn't need the glittery, and you don't need the sweet. Your lips are sweet enough!  Do not apply lipstick before you kiss. Lipstick may look smashing, but it's usually for older women. It can smudge when you kiss, leaving your kissing partner marked. If you have the luxury of brushing your teeth right before the kiss, take advantage of it. If not, take a breath mint. Avoid onions, garlic, and other strong-tasting foods right before you kiss. Send the signal for your partner to get ready for the kiss by getting really close. Almost uncomfortably close. If your partner moves back, she/he isn't ready for a kiss. If your partner stays where s/he is or moves even closer, you know you're doing something right. This one is important. Fix the other person's gaze with your eyes. The eyes are very powerful, and they can communicate a lot of things that we can't with our voice.  When you move in for the kiss, turn your eyes to the person's mouth. You want your mouth to land on the other person's mouth, so you need your eyes if you don't want to botch the landing. Once your lips are interlocked, close your eyes. We don't know why, but it's kinda creepy to have someone staring at you while you kiss them. It's better just to close your eyes altogether. If you try to kiss your partner straight on, your noses are going to get in the way and keep you from actually meeting lips. Instead, tilt your head either to the left or the right slightly so that your noses don't disturb the action your lips want!  If you're sitting next to a person, the side your sitting on should dictate which way you tilt your head:  If you're sitting to the left of someone, it's best to tilt your head to the left. If you're sitting to the right of someone, it's best to tilt your head to the right. The first time you kiss, keep your lips locked for a couple seconds, unless the other person opens their lips and starts kissing quicker. If you let the first kiss last, you'll get rid of some butterflies and set the stage for the next couple of kisses. Not at the same time, of course. Start by taking your lips and softly kiss your partner's lower lip a few times. Then, move to their upper lip.  Be gentle. Your partner will appreciate it, even if your heart is beating through your chest. Plus, it will make the kiss more sensual. Be responsive. Responsive just means respond to what the other person is doing. A kiss is like a dance: you have to move based on how your partner moves. Go for slow instead of fast. A bad kisser will try to rush the kiss, kissing at about a thousand lips per second. Slow it down, savor every last touch of the lips, and remember to keep your eyes closed!

Some of Baird's early inventions were not fully successful. In his twenties he tried to create diamonds by heating graphite and shorted out Glasgow's electricity supply. Later Baird invented a glass razor, which was rust-resistant, but shattered. Inspired by pneumatic tyres he attempted to make pneumatic shoes, but his prototype contained semi-inflated balloons, which burst. He also invented a thermal undersock (the Baird undersock), which was moderately successful. Baird suffered from cold feet, and after a number of trials, he found that an extra layer of cotton inside the sock provided warmth.  Baird's numerous other developments demonstrated his particular talent at invention. He was a visionary and began to dabble with electricity. In 1928, he developed an early video recording device, which he dubbed Phonovision. The system consisted of a large Nipkow disk attached by a mechanical linkage to a conventional 78-rpm record-cutting lathe. The result was a disc that could record and play back a 30-line video signal. Technical difficulties with the system prevented its further development, but some of the original phonodiscs have been preserved, and have since been restored by Donald McLean, a Scottish electrical engineer.  Baird's other developments were in fibre-optics, radio direction finding, infrared night viewing and radar. There is discussion about his exact contribution to the development of radar, for his wartime defence projects have never been officially acknowledged by the UK government. According to Malcolm Baird, his son, what is known is that in 1926 Baird filed a patent for a device that formed images from reflected radio waves, a device remarkably similar to radar, and that he was in correspondence with the British government at the time. The radar contribution is in dispute. According to some experts, Baird's \\"noctovision\\" is not radar. Unlike radar (except Doppler radar), Noctovision is incapable of determining the distance to the scanned subject. Noctovision also cannot determine the coordinates of the subject in three-dimensional space.

This is one of the greatest restaurants I have ever been to and I wish to god I had the kind of wit and vocabulary to accurately reflect the really really REALLY good meal I had here.    As soon as i walked in, I felt really special, which sounds corny and laughably pathetic but I'm not kidding...I felt like one of Angelina Jolie's adopted kids...really special.  The host was a chipper fellow who whisked our coats away and took us to our cozy nook on the second tier in full view of the slate waterfall cascading down the full length of the 3 story restaurant.  I was mesmerized.    Our waitress was a sophisticated, demure lady who catered to our every need and helped us navigate the wonderfully creative menu.  We were given yummy complimentary scallop appetizers over baby veggies.  My sister and I immediately looked at each other and knew this was gonna be goodddddd...  I would spell out every dish and how friggin' awesome it was but I'll post pictures instead...even the one of me crying at the end of the meal.  Be sure to read the captions...  The bathroom was gorgeous showcasing cutting-edge design concepts which had me convinced there was a hidden camera shooting me for the next \\"Bold look of Kohler\\" commercial (in the non-creepiest way...I do realize I'm talking about hidden cameras in a public bathroom).

Every now and then, we are gifted with a rare sighting of an animal that is simply extraordinary. One such example of nature's amazing surprises is the appearance of a white squirrel. With the odds of a squirrel being born white thought to be about one in 100,000, spotting one in your back garden is definitely an occasion worth capturing on camera.  The Rarity, Background, and Cause of White Squirrels White squirrels are incredibly rare, with their numbers estimated to be as low as one in 100,000. This rarity in the squirrel population can be attributed to a few factors. Most white squirrels are the result of a genetic trait known as leucism or albinism. In the case of leucism, there is a partial loss of pigmentation in the animal, leading it to appear white or pale in color. Albino squirrels, on the other hand, have a complete lack of melanin production, which leads to their white fur and pink or reddish eyes. White squirrels tend to face several challenges in the wild, predisposing them to a lower likelihood of survival as compared to their more common, brown- or grey-furred counterparts. Due to their stark contrast from their surroundings, white squirrels are more easily spotted by predators, significantly endangering their lives. Furthermore, the absence of pigmentation in albinos makes them susceptible to a range of health issues, including susceptibility to sunburn and poor eyesight.  Capturing the Moment Despite the odds, spotting a white squirrel is truly a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity that should be celebrated and documented. Using a camera to capture this rare moment is essential for several reasons: 1. Preserving the memory: Encountering a white squirrel is a unique and unforgettable experience. Taking a photograph of the enchanting creature is a fantastic way to cherish the moment and share it with your friends and family. 2. Raising awareness: By capturing the sighting on film, you can help raise awareness for these rare animals and their conservation. By sharing the images or anecdotes, you encourage others to appreciate the diversity and beauty of the wildlife in their own backyards. 3. Research opportunities: Documenting white squirrel sightings can be a valuable contribution to ongoing research dedicated to understanding the genetics, distribution, and ecology surrounding these uncommon creatures. Citizen scientists can add to the available information and increase the knowledge on these elusive animals. Conclusion Nature is undoubtedly full of wondrous creatures, and the white squirrel is a shining testament to that. The odds of one being born are already astoundingly low at an estimated one in 100,000, making each sighting an exceptional event worth preserving on camera. Not only does capturing these events allow us to celebrate and appreciate the marvels of nature, but it also contributes to the research and conservation of these captivating animals. Encounters with white squirrels serve as a reminder to be more aware of our natural surroundings and to protect the environment for these rare beauties and the countless other creatures that call it home."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

They are tetrapods, but the snakes and a few species of lizard either have no limbs or their limbs are much reduced in size. Their bones are better ossified and their skeletons stronger than those of amphibians. The teeth are conical and mostly uniform in size. The surface cells of the epidermis are modified into horny scales which create a waterproof layer. Reptiles are unable to use their skin for respiration as do amphibians and have a more efficient respiratory system drawing air into their lungs by expanding their chest walls. The heart resembles that of the amphibian but there is a septum which more completely separates the oxygenated and deoxygenated bloodstreams. The reproductive system has evolved for internal fertilization, with a copulatory organ present in most species. The eggs are surrounded by amniotic membranes which prevents them from drying out and are laid on land, or develop internally in some species. The bladder is small as nitrogenous waste is excreted as uric acid.Turtles are notable for their protective shells. They have an inflexible trunk encased in a horny carapace above and a plastron below. These are formed from bony plates embedded in the dermis which are overlain by horny ones and are partially fused with the ribs and spine. The neck is long and flexible and the head and the legs can be drawn back inside the shell. Turtles are vegetarians and the typical reptile teeth have been replaced by sharp, horny plates. In aquatic species, the front legs are modified into flippers.Tuataras superficially resemble lizards but the lineages diverged in the Triassic period. There is one living species, Sphenodon punctatus. The skull has two openings (fenestrae) on either side and the jaw is rigidly attached to the skull. There is one row of teeth in the lower jaw and this fits between the two rows in the upper jaw when the animal chews. The teeth are merely projections of bony material from the jaw...  and the situation: Two continents were known for the strange discrepancies in animal populations.

The Philips scheme is more limited in its scope, but has the benefit of being ready for market. It works by making each of the fitted LEDs transmit a distinct location code. If users open a compatible app and let their smartphone camera look upwards, this can be used to determine their location - accurate to up to 1m - and the direction they are facing. It functions in a similar way to GPS-based maps used outdoors, and compares favourably to wi-fi based location systems, which are typically accurate to only 3-5m. Many retailers, however, are investing instead in beacons - small Bluetooth 4 transmitters that allow compatible apps to work out how far away a user is standing, but not their precise position. Beacons have the benefit of being cheaper and potentially easier to try out than replacing a store's complete lighting system. However, one expert saw the merits of Philips's alternative. \\"You have to look at this as a long-term investment, but this is potentially an easier spend to swallow as you're not just betting on one thing - you still have a good lighting system,\\" commented Chris Green, principal technology analyst at the Davies Murphy Group consultancy. \\"It also goes far beyond what is achievable with the beacons. \\"To try and get a similar effect you'd need so many of them that they would be awkward to deploy, plus you'd need to rely on users having a phone that not only supports the newer Bluetooth standard but also has it switched on. \\"By contrast, this is up in the air, so easier to roll out.\\" A summary of the above article is?","output":"The article discusses a new technology designed by Philips and installed at a Carrefour supermarket in Lille, France.

After two years in Yonkers, New York, the family moved to Longmeadow, Massachusetts, where Santiago attended Longmeadow High School and graduated from Wilbraham & Monson Academy in 1983. His first experience with a musical instrument was playing a Hammond organ at the age of eight, but he never took on the instrument seriously because he had to share it with five brothers. Santiago first played a guitar at the age of nine after he noticed a classical guitar hanging on his oldest brother's wall for decoration.

In August 1913, Karluk, a brigantine formerly used as a whaler, became trapped in the  ice while sailing to a rendezvous point at Herschel Island. After a long drift across the Beaufort and Chukchi seas, in January 1914 the ship was crushed and sunk. In the ensuing months, the crew and expedition staff struggled to survive, first on the ice and later on the shores of Wrangel Island. In all, eleven men died before rescue. The Canadian Arctic Expedition was organised under the leadership of Canadian anthropologist Vilhjalmur Stefansson, and had both scientific and geographic purposes. Shortly after Karluk was trapped, Stefansson and a small party left the ship, stating that they intended to hunt for caribou. However, the ice carried Karluk westwards, far from the hunting party who found it impossible  to return to the ship. Stefansson reached land and then devoted himself to the expedition's scientific objectives, leaving the crew and staff on board the ship under the charge of its captain, Robert Bartlett. After the sinking, Bartlett organised a march across the ice to Wrangel Island, 80 miles (130 km) away. Conditions   were difficult and dangerous; two four-man parties were lost before the island was reached. From the island, Bartlett and an Inuk companion set out across the frozen sea for the Siberian coast, in search of help. Assisted by local populations, the pair eventually reached Alaska, but sea ice conditions prevented any immediate rescue mission. On Wrangel Island, the stranded party survived by hunting game, but were short of food and troubled by internal dissent.

See options at the end Sarah has able to ride a bike without training wheels, unlike Katrina, because  Pick your answer from: (1). Sarah was younger and had poor balance.; (2). Katrina was younger and had poor balance.;","output":"Sarah has been able to ride a bike without training wheels, unlike Katrina, because Katrina was younger and had poor balance. This statement illustrates that Sarah's proficiency in biking has less to do with her own abilities and more to do with Katrina's lack of the same. Let's break it down a little more:  To begin, age can be an important factor in developing certain physical skills such as bike riding. Younger children often struggle more with balance due to the ongoing development of their motor skills. Adults, on the other hand, generally have fully developed motor skills and therefore better balance. So, if Katrina was younger than Sarah when trying to learn bike-riding, she might've had more difficulty due to her age and still-developing motor skills. The ability to ride a bike is heavily dependent on balance. It requires the rider to continually adjust their body position to stay upright while maintaining control over the direction and speed of the bike. If Katrina had poor balance, this would certainly make riding a bike without training wheels much more challenging. Training wheels help keep the bike stable while learners are still developing their balance skills for bike riding. If Katrina was not yet able to maintain her balance independently, she would need to continue using training wheels. In contrast, Sarah, being presumably older than Katrina, has developed better balance and may have accessed bike riding at an age when her balance and motor skills were better developed. This developmental edge could've made it easier for her to learn how to ride without training wheels. Assuming they had comparable opportunities and resources for learning, it's plausible that Sarah was able to ditch the training wheels before Katrina due to these age-linked physical development differences. But it's worth remembering that every individual's growth and development is different. Some might have excellent balance at a younger age, while others might only develop it when they get a little older. It's a process that's unique to each person, which is why it's important to be patient and understanding when teaching new skills, especially those like biking that have a physical developmental component.  To summarize, Sarah has been able to ride a bike without training wheels, unlike Katrina, because Katrina was younger and had poor balance. But with time, practice, and patience, Katrina will likely be able to develop the necessary balance and skills to ride without training wheels, just like Sarah."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","output":"Yes, these two questions are inquiring about the same information, which is understanding if an individual identifies as an introvert. I will provide you with a detailed and long answer to help you identify if you may be an introvert. Introversion and extroversion are personality aspects that describe how individuals respond to social situations and where they gain their energy. Introverts typically gain energy by spending time alone or in small, intimate groups, while extroverts thrive in larger groups and social situations. It's important to note that these traits exist on a continuum, and most people fall somewhere in between, as ambiverts. Here are some key characteristics and behaviors that may indicate you are an introvert: 1. Social preferences: One primary sign of an introvert is preferring to spend time alone or in the company of a few close friends and family, rather than larger social occasions. If you feel drained after attending bigger events and need time to recharge, you could be an introvert. 2. Need for privacy and personal space: Introverts generally value their privacy and the need to have a space of their own, where they feel safe to think, process, and recharge away from the stimuli of the world. 3. Enjoyment of solitude: Unlike extroverts who gain energy from social situations, introverts usually prefer engaging in activities alone or involving fewer people. They might enjoy reading, writing, or other solitary hobbies. 4. Deep thinkers: Introverts tend to have a rich inner world and often engage in deep thinking and introspection. They may spend significant time pondering life's complexities, analyzing situations, and reflecting on their feelings and thoughts. 5. Active listening skills: Introverts often excel at listening and absorbing information, preferring to observe and understand the world around them before speaking up or sharing their insights. 6. Small group preferences: Introverts generally feel more comfortable in small, intimate group settings where they can engage in meaningful conversations rather than trying to mingle in larger, more chaotic environments. 7. Selective in forming relationships: Introverts usually prefer to develop a few deep and close relationships rather than having numerous, but less intimate acquaintances. 8. Sensitivity to external stimuli: Introverts might be more sensitive to external stimuli such as loud noises, bright lights, or large crowds, which can lead to overwhelm and the need to retreat from these settings. 9. Focus and concentration: Introverts often have the ability to maintain focus on a task or project for extended periods, particularly in quiet or secluded environments. Remember that people can have a combination of introverted and extroverted qualities, and exhibiting some of these characteristics may not necessarily mean one exclusively identifies as an introvert. Personality traits can evolve over time with experience and personal development. To further explore if you are an introvert, consider taking reliable self-assessment tests, such as the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) or the Big Five Personality Test. These tests can provide valuable insights into your personality type and help you better understand your preferences and tendencies."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Remans are a slave race of the Romulan Empire, used as miners and cannon fodder. A faction of the military is in support of Shinzon, but the Praetor and senate are set against it. After rejecting the motion, the Praetor and remaining senators are disintegrated by a device left in the room by a military-aligned senator. Meanwhile, the crew of the USS Enterprise-E prepares to bid farewell to first officer Commander William Riker and Counselor Deanna Troi, who are being married on Betazed. En route, they discover a positronic energy reading on a planet in the Kolaran system near the Romulan Neutral Zone. Captain Jean-Luc Picard, Lieutenant Commander Worf, and Lieutenant Commander Data land on Kolarus III and discover the remnants of an android resembling Data. When the android is reassembled it introduces itself as B-4. The crew deduce it to be a less-advanced, earlier version of Data. Picard is contacted by Vice Admiral Kathryn Janeway and orders the ship on a diplomatic mission to nearby Romulus. Janeway explains that the Romulan Empire has been taken over in a military coup by Shinzon, who says he wants peace with the Federation and to bring freedom to Remus. On arrival, they learn Shinzon is a clone of Picard, secretly created by Romulans to plant a high ranking spy into the Federation, but the project was abandoned and Shinzon left on Remus as a child to die as a slave. After many years, Shinzon became a leader of the Remans, and constructed his heavily armed flagship, the Scimitar. Initially, diplomatic efforts go well, but the Enterprise crew discover the Scimitar is producing low levels of thalaron radiation, which had been used to kill the Imperial Senate and is deadly to nearly all life forms.

In the months that followed, North West made headlines and became a trending topic on social media platforms, with some fans loving the unique name and others poking fun at it. As the world eagerly awaited the couple's explanation of their choice, Kim and Kanye remained tight-lipped on the matter. Meanwhile, North West, or \\"Nori\\" as her parents affectionately called her, began to grow up in the spotlight, with paparazzi capturing her every move. Both Kim and Kanye continued their rise to fame, carefully balancing their careers with their new roles as parents. Nori eventually started school and, despite her famous parents, managed to maintain a relatively normal childhood. The world became familiar with her sense of style, a blend of her mom's glamorous taste and her dad's cutting-edge fashion sense. As she grew older, North West developed a love for the arts, inspired by her father's passion for music and her mother's love for fashion.

Lila Loomis (Vera Miles), sister of Marion Crane, vehemently protests with a petition that she has been circulating with signatures of 743 people, including the relatives of the seven people Norman killed prior to his incarceration, but her plea is dismissed. Norman is taken to his old home behind the Bates Motel by Dr. Bill Raymond (Robert Loggia), who assures him everything will be fine. Norman is introduced to the motel's new manager, Warren Toomey (Dennis Franz). The following day, Norman reports to a prearranged job as a dishwasher and busboy at a nearby diner, run by a kindly old lady named Emma Spool (Claudia Bryar). One of his co-workers there is Mary Samuels (Meg Tilly), a young waitress. After work, Mary claims she has been thrown out of her boyfriend's place and needs a place to stay. Norman offers to let her stay at the motel, then extends the offer to his home when he discovers that Toomey has turned what had been a shabby but respectable motel into a sleazy adult one.

Premise: so i don't know and it's also a long way away Hypothesis: It's also a long way away Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","output":"To determine if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, we must first break down the premise and the hypothesis to understand the information they convey. Premise: \\"So I don't know and it's also a long way away.\\" The premise comprises two separate statements: 1. \\"I don't know\\" - The speaker does not have enough information or knowledge about the subject. 2. \\"It's also a long way away.\\" - The subject being discussed is far away from the speaker's current location or in terms of time or difficulty. Hypothesis: \\"It's also a long way away.\\" The hypothesis is a single statement referring to the idea that the subject is at a considerable distance from the speaker's location or in terms of time or difficulty. To examine if the hypothesis is entailed by the premise, we need to assess if the information provided in the premise is adequate to hold the hypothesis true. If the premise necessarily leads to the hypothesis, it can be said that the hypothesis is entailed by the premise. In this case, we see that the second statement in the premise is identical to the hypothesis. When the speaker says, \\"it's also a long way away,\\" they are directly referring to the idea expressed in the hypothesis. Thus, we can confidently state that the hypothesis, \\"It's also a long way away,\\" is entailed by the premise, \\"So I don't know and it's also a long way away.\\" However, it is essential to note that the first statement in the premise (i.e., \\"I don't know\\") is irrelevant to the entailed hypothesis. This particular portion of the premise does not provide adequate information to draw any valid conclusions about whether or not the hypothesis is entailed.

Hint: Before iodized salt was developed, some people experienced a number of developmental difficulties, including problems with thyroid gland function and mental retardation. In the 1920s, we learned that these conditions could usually be treated easily with the addition of iodide anion to the diet.

This is primarily due to natural iodine sources being more abundant in coastal regions. Coastal populations typically have access to seafood and seaweed, which are rich in iodine. Seawater also contains a higher concentration of iodide ions, allowing marine plants and animals to accumulate them in their bodies. Therefore, people living near the coast who consume these marine products tend to have a sufficient intake of iodine. Moreover, the soil near the ocean also contains higher levels of iodine from the sea, which permeates into the soil and crops grown along the coast. Conversely, inland populations face a higher risk of iodine deficiency. In regions farther from the coast, the soil generally contains lower levels of iodine. This is a result of the natural decrease in iodine content as one moves farther from the ocean and the natural processes, such as rain and geological leaching, which carry away minerals from the soil. As a consequence, the crops and water that people rely on in these inland areas are likely to have much lower iodine concentrations. Before the introduction of iodized salt, iodine deficiency was a significant issue, especially in rural or mountainous areas. The 1920s marked a turning point in the understanding and treatment of iodine deficiency when it was discovered that adding iodide anion to the diet could alleviate its related health problems. One of the easiest ways to increase iodide intake was by adding it to table salt. The widespread use of iodized salt has played a crucial role in preventing iodine deficiencies worldwide. In conclusion, inland populations historically faced a higher risk of iodine deficiencies and their associated health problems compared to those in coastal regions, primarily due to the limited availability of natural iodine sources in their diet and soil. The implementation of iodized salt as a public health measure has greatly contributed to reducing this risk and improving the overall health of individuals living in both coastal and inland areas. However, it is essential to continue monitoring iodine levels and taking appropriate preventive measures, especially in regions where deficiency remains a concern."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

According to some people of the 1780s American English was a peasant's language that a \\"gentleman\\" will not speak. Considered in a bilingual point of view, British English was the dominant language linked to prestige and language purism . The belief in the authority or say in the superior of British English, has remained to the twentieth century, especially in the former British Empire or in the fields of British influence. Thus, it is reported that in prefix = st1 /China, teachers and school textbooks refer to and recommend Received Pronunciation as the model, as well as standard British sentence structures, spelling and words. British English is also encouraged and accepted as the criteria of some major official examinations, for example, College English Test and Test for English Majors which are conducted by government. Similar situations could be found in countries, for example, in Africa, the West African Examination Council and Joint Admission accepts the British English as the standard English. Report can also be found that inCairosome university students received lower grades if they used American spellings instead of British English. In Europe, we find teachers, British people as well as natives of the country in which they work, who follow the British English standard, and laugh at the American English. However, the above attitudes are nothing but the last influence of a long-gone period of British supermacy . The beginning of a clear lead of American English can be traced to the decades after World War II. This coincides with the simultaneous  rise of the US as a military and technological power and the decline of the British Empire, which drove many to American English.

Michael took Steven to the shooting range because","output":"Michael took Steven to the shooting range because he recognized that both of them shared a strong passion for firearms, and he wanted to bond with Steven by engaging in an activity that they both enjoyed and appreciated. Michael knew his way around firearms, having gained extensive knowledge and practical experience since he was young. His father, a military officer, had instilled in him both respect and admiration for firearms, emphasizing the importance of safety and proper handling when using them. As a result, Michael had developed exceptional marksmanship skills and a keen understanding of various firearm models and their mechanisms. Steven, on the other hand, also knew his way around a firearm but came from a different background. Raised by a single mother, he never had the same close connection with a strong male role model like Michael's father. Nonetheless, he developed a love for firearms on his own, primarily through books, online forums, and watching videos on the internet. On weekends, he would join his friends at a local shooting range to practice and hone his skills, gradually familiarizing himself with different guns and their individual quirks. Shooting became more than just a hobby to Steven; it was an essential outlet for him, a means of feeling empowered and confident in a world that had often left him feeling vulnerable and insecure. Michael, having observed Steven's enthusiasm and dedication to the world of firearms, decided to take him along to the shooting range one fateful afternoon to strengthen their connection. He believed that the shared experience would provide them with an opportunity to learn from each other and create a powerful bonding experience that transcended mere hobby or activity. Upon arriving at the range, Michael wasted no time setting up targets and preparing their firearms for a day of shooting. The two men eagerly exchanged insights on different models, firing techniques, and overall gun safety practices. As the hours flew by, Michael and Steven found their conversations expanding beyond the boundaries of firearms, delving into more profound discussions about life, aspirations, and the paths they were forging in this world. As the sun began to set, the pair reflected on the many lessons they had learned from each other throughout the day. It was clear that this shared experience had brought them closer, transcending their initial common ground of firearms and developing into a profound connection characterized by mutual respect and understanding. In summary, Michael took Steven to the shooting range because he recognized the significance of their shared passion for firearms and foresaw the potential for a powerful bonding experience that would ultimately allow them to forge a strong friendship. This shared activity enabled both Michael and Steven to learn valuable skills from one another, creating a unique and meaningful connection that would undoubtedly last a lifetime."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The Brown Eyed Girls (Hangul: beuraun aideu geolseu, Japanese: buraunaidogaruzu), often abbreviated as B.E.G., BG or beuageol (beu-ah-geol) is a South Korean girl group managed by Mystic Entertainment. The group consists of four members: JeA, Miryo, Narsha, and Gain. They debuted as an R&B/Ballad vocal group with \\"Come Closer (dagawaseo)\\" in 2006 and have since challenged themselves with a notable variety of different music genres. They rose to popularity in 2008 with \\"L.O.V.E\\" and their retro-dance number \\"How Come,\\" and cemented their position in the K-pop world in 2009 with \\"Abracadabra\\", with its electronica-based genre, pioneering (albeit controversial) concept, along with its iconic and now globally recognized dance entitled 'The Arrogant Dance (sigeonbangcum)'--successfully ingraining themselves into modern popular culture. The group's leader, Jea, was the one responsible of the group's creation and was actively involved in the selection of the other members, picking out Miryo, who was known as a great female rapper from the hip-hop community having previously worked with other fellow rappers, such as Gil Seong-joon from Leessang, and the main female rapper in well-known hip-hop group Honey Family. Narsha was chosen when Jea remembered her as a \\"talented singer\\" from her high school days, and Ga-in was selected by the three members after she was eliminated from \\"Battle Shin Hwa.\\" According to Ga-in, she was crying in the bathroom after failing the audition, was found by composer Ahn Jung Hoon, and then was chosen through the audition in Brown Eyed Girls' company. Singer Yoari trained with the group until 2006, when it was decided she would be the lead singer for Sprinkler. The four members held several small size concerts, and was actually known as \\"Crescendo\\" before officially debuting as \\"Brown Eyed Girls.\\"  After more than 3 years of training in singing and holding several small size concerts, the Brown Eyed Girls released their debut album Your Story in South Korea on March 2, 2006, with the ballad track, \\"Come Closer\\" as their single. Debuting as a \\"faceless group\\" they did not appear on any visual media and chose to not even appear in their own music video. The album was well received by critics but did not do as well as expected commercially. The album was later re-released to include \\"Hold The Line\\" (which samples \\"Push The Button\\" by British girl band Sugababes and \\"Technologic\\" by Daft Punk). This song became a hit, further boosting the band's popularity. \\"Hold the Line\\" was disclosed across the world because it was included in the list of songs from the game Pump it Up.  After a short break, the group went back into the studio to work on their second album Leave Ms. Kim (ddeonara miseugim), which included their R&B title track \\"You Got Me Fooled\\" (neoege sogassda). Subsequent singles were \\"Oasis\\" (oasiseu) featuring Lee Jae Hoon and \\"It's Mine\\" (naeggeoya), a collaboration with fellow group SeeYa.  During the break between their debut and second albums, the Brown Eyed Girls released their first digital single entitled \\"I Am a Summer\\" (naega yeoreumida), which was later included in their second LP.  The first two albums contained typical R&B ballads which had been very popular in the K-pop scene. However, the commercial success was relatively higher in two singles between the first and second albums. Moreover, the second album containing \\"You Got Me Fooled\\" (neoege sogassda) was released at nearly the same time as Wonder Girls' \\"Tell Me\\" which received a nationwide success in Korea. Therefore, their second album was once again a commercial disappointment. At the same time, the general K-pop scene was changing from R&B ballads to dance music.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Is Your Story the name of an album?","output":"Yes, Your Story is the name of an album.

Q: Question: In what year did the industrialist that Sætren worked for found the company that he also managed? Passage:Sætren studied at Lillehammer Latin- og Realskole, at Qvams skole in Christiania and at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich from 1862 to 1865. In 1866 he started working as a draftsman for Kanalvæsenet, the body for exploitation of Norwegian water resources, and held various positions at Kanalvæsenet over a period of 41 years. He ended his career as manager for the Bandak-Norsjø Canal from 1891 to 1907. The boat locks of the Bandak-Norsjø Canal could lift boats with a length of up to 100 feet. The canal became an important water transport system, and also a tourist destination. Sætren was a counsellor for industrialist Sam Eyde, the founder and first mangager of Norsk Hydro, who acquired rights for exploiting waterfalls for hydroelectric power. Sætren published maps and overviews of water resources in Norway, such as his map  from 1904. He was the first editor of the magazine Norsk Teknisk Tidsskrift, which he edited from 1883 to 1886. He was also a proponent for the construction of the Holmenkoll Line, and chaired the board of directors for ten years from 1896.

Ballads derive from the medieval French \\"chanson balladée\\" or \\"ballade\\", which were originally \\"danced songs\\". Ballads were particularly characteristic of the popular poetry and song of the British Isles from the later medieval period until the 19th century. They were widely used across Europe, and later in the Americas, Australia and North Africa. Ballads are 13 lines with an ABABBCBC form, consisting of couplets (two lines) of rhymed verse, each of 14 syllables.  - Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound and silence, which exist in time. The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the \\"color\\" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek  (\\"mousike\\"; \\"art of the Muses\\"). In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form include the production of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as \\"the harmony of the spheres\\" and \\"it is music to my ears\\" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, \\"There is no noise, only sound.\\"  - Jesus Christ Superstar is a 1970 rock opera with music by Andrew Lloyd Webber and lyrics by Tim Rice. The musical started as a rock opera concept album before its Broadway debut in 1971. The musical is sung-through, with no spoken dialogue. The story is loosely based on the Gospels' accounts of the last week of Jesus's life, beginning with the preparation for the arrival of Jesus and his disciples in Jerusalem and ending with the crucifixion. It highlights political and interpersonal struggles between Judas Iscariot and Jesus that are not present in the Bible narratives.  - Slowhand is a 1977 album by Eric Clapton. Released on 25 November by RSO Records, and titled after Clapton's nickname, it is one of his commercially and critically most successful studio albums. \\"Slowhand\\" produced the two hit singles \\"Lay Down Sally\\" and \\"Wonderful Tonight\\", reached various international music charts and was honored with numerous awards and recording certifications. In 2012, a deluxe edition was released to celebrate the album's 35th anniversary.  - \`\` Wonderful Tonight '' is a ballad written by Eric Clapton . It was included on Clapton 's 1977 album Slowhand . Clapton wrote the song about Pattie Boyd . The female vocal harmonies on the song are provided by Marcella Detroit ( then Marcy Levy ) and Yvonne Elliman .  - London is the capital and most populous city of England and the United Kingdom, as well as the most populous city proper in the European Union. Standing on the River Thames in the south east of the island of Great Britain, London has been a major settlement for two millennia. It was founded by the Romans, who named it \\"Londinium\\". London's ancient core, the City of London, largely retains its medieval boundaries. Since at least the 19th century, \\"London\\" has also referred to the metropolis around this core, historically split between Middlesex, Essex, Surrey, Kent, and Hertfordshire, which today largely makes up Greater London, governed by the Mayor of London and the London Assembly.  - \\"Lay Down Sally\\" is a song performed by Eric Clapton, and written by Clapton, Marcella Detroit (as Marcy Levy, the diminutive form of her birth name), and George Terry. It appeared on his November 1977 album \\"Slowhand\\", and reached No. 3 on the \\"Billboard\\" Hot 100 chart.  - The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum is a hall of fame and museum located on the shore of Lake Erie in downtown Cleveland, Ohio, United States. The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Foundation was established on April 20, 1983, by Atlantic Records founder and chairman Ahmet Ertegun to recognize and archive the history of the best-known and most influential artists, producers, engineers, and other notable figures who have had some major influence on the development of rock and roll. In 1986, Cleveland was chosen as the hall of fame's permanent home. Since opening in September 1995, the \\"Rock Hall\\"  part of the city's redeveloped North Coast Harbor  has hosted more than 10 million visitors and had a cumulative economic impact estimated at more than 1.8 billion.  - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries.  - Marcella Detroit (born Marcella Levy, June 21, 1952) is an American soprano vocalist (perhaps best known for her backup singing on many Top 20 Billboard hits), guitarist, and songwriter.

Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"Terry Eastland, the author who wrote From Ending Affirmative Action: The Case for Colorblind Justice states, \\"Most arguments for affirmative action fall into two categories: remedying past discrimination and promoting diversity\\". Eastland believes that the founders of affirmative action did not anticipate how the benefits of affirmative action would go to those who did not need it, mostly middle class minorities. Additionally, she argues that affirmative action carries with it a stigma that can create feelings of self-doubt and entitlement in minorities. Eastland believes that affirmative action is a great risk that only sometimes pays off, and that without it we would be able to compete more freely with one another. Libertarian economist Thomas Sowell identified what he says are negative results of affirmative action in his book, Affirmative Action Around the World: An Empirical Study. Sowell writes that affirmative action policies encourage non-preferred groups to designate themselves as members of preferred groups [i.e., primary beneficiaries of affirmative action] to take advantage of group preference policies; that they tend to benefit primarily the most fortunate among the preferred group (e.g., upper and middle class blacks), often to the detriment of the least fortunate among the non-preferred groups (e.g., poor white or Asian); that they reduce the incentives of both the preferred and non-preferred to perform at their best – the former because doing so is unnecessary and the latter because it can prove futile – thereby resulting in net losses for society as a whole; and that they engender animosity toward preferred groups as well.:115–147\\"?

Matthew was able to solve the case but Lawrence was totally stumped, because  Available options: [A]. Matthew lacked the attention to detail do the job. [B]. Lawrence lacked the attention to detail do the job.","output":"B. Lawrence lacked the attention to detail do the job. Despite their partnership, Matthew and Lawrence had stark differences in their approach to solving cases. Matthew was a seasoned detective; his reputation was built upon his incredible prowess in piecing together clues and spotting the minute details that others often overlooked. Lawrence, on the other hand, was relatively new to the field. Though he possessed an impressive understanding of the criminal mind, he lacked the essential attention to detail in order to unravel the complexities of most cases. As the investigation unfolded, the duo faced one of the most challenging puzzles of their careers. The case involved a series of seemingly unrelated thefts, each one more elaborate than the last. At first glance, there appeared to be no discernible pattern. Yet, amidst the chaos, Matthew’s keen eye picked up on the subtle connections between the crimes. Lawrence found himself growing increasingly frustrated with his inability to discover such connections. He dedicated long hours to studying the reports, poring over crime scene photos, and examining evidence, all in an attempt to match his partner's efficacy. Despite his determination, the success he craved continued to elude him. The limits of his capabilities became all too apparent as the case progressed. Matthew, aware of his partner's struggles, became increasingly concerned about Lawrence's mental and emotional state. The stress of the case was evident in Lawrence's graying demeanor, his strained voice, and the deepening lines on his tired face. Nonetheless, Matthew resolved to bolster his partner's self-confidence by encouraging him to take on more responsibility in the investigation. But the persistent presence of Lawrence’s weakness left them at a disadvantage. The case required an exceptional level of scrutiny, and while Matthew did his best to delegate tasks, he could not ignore the fact that Lawrence's inadequacy was hindering their progress. Matthew realized that this was no ordinary case—rather, it was one that could potentially make or break their partnership. As the two worked tirelessly over the case, Matthew began to close in on the truth. He discovered an intricate web of strategic dealings, unexpected twists, and falsified alibis, all pointing toward one mastermind responsible for orchestrating the crimes. With his keen perception and years of experience, Matthew expertly unraveled the manipulation and deceit that had kept the criminal concealed for so long. When the case was finally solved, Matthew looked on as Lawrence stood crestfallen, overwhelmed by his shortcomings. Lawrence's frustration at his inability to contribute as he had hoped, coupled with Matthew’s astounding success, cast a heavy pall over his self-worth. But it was in this moment of self-doubt that Matthew imparted a valuable lesson. It is in the face of our deepest failures that we discover our greatest opportunities for growth. All great detectives, Matthew explained, have experienced loss and failure. But it is in the ashes of defeat that true potential and determination are forged. As Matthew and Lawrence moved on to their next case, they did so with a newfound understanding of their dynamic partnership. Lawrence, still stung by his struggles but inspired by Matthew's words, vowed to better himself and one day master the art of paying attention to detail. Together, they continued to tackle the dark shadows of crime, each one learning from the other, and striving to become the best detectives they could be."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Process:  - Food is taken into the mouth - The food is chewed - Saliva mixes with the food and starts breaking it down - The chewed food travels down the esophagus to the stomach - The stomach secretes acid - Grinds and mixes the food - The food moves to the small intestine - The small intestine uses enzymes to further break down the food - The food passes into the colon - The food is expelled from the body.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose High fiber foods like Bran happens, how will it affect Foods with lots of fiber are eaten.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","output":"The perturbation hypothesis suggests that introducing a change, in this case, the consumption of high fiber foods like bran, may have an effect on the previously mentioned process of digestion. Foods with lots of fiber will indeed have a direct impact on the digestive process, particularly on the movement and breakdown of food, as well as nutrient absorption. Let's examine the impact of high fiber foods on each step of the digestive process: 1. Food is taken into the mouth: High fiber foods like bran might require more chewing due to their texture, which in turn increases the time spent in the mouth for mechanical breakdown. 2. The food is chewed: Chewing breaks down the food into smaller pieces, making it easier for enzymes like amylase in saliva to break down the carbohydrates in fiber-rich foods. 3. Saliva mixes with the food and starts breaking it down: Salivary amylase, an enzyme found in saliva, breaks down some of the carbohydrates in high fiber foods, specifically targeting starch while leaving most of the fiber intact. 4. The chewed food travels down the esophagus to the stomach: The presence of fiber in the food bolus may slow down the movement through the esophagus due to increased viscosity. 5. The stomach secretes acid: Fiber-rich foods have a buffering effect by absorbing and neutralizing some of the stomach acid, which may reduce irritation or damage to the stomach lining. 6. Grinds and mixes the food: High fiber foods might take longer to be broken down in the stomach due to gastric motility, slowing down the gastric emptying rate. This increased transit time in the stomach creates a feeling of fullness or satiety, which may reduce total calorie intake. 7. The food moves to the small intestine: Fiber can help regulate the release of food into the small intestine, preventing sudden spikes in blood sugar. However, the presence of fiber may also reduce the efficiency of nutrient absorption as it can interfere with the absorption of certain minerals, vitamins, and other nutrients by binding to them. 8. The small intestine uses enzymes to further break down the food: High fiber foods increase the secretion of digestive enzymes (like pancreatic amylase and lipase) to help break down the carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. However, insoluble fiber is not broken down by these enzymes and remains relatively intact, as it travels through the small intestine. 9. The food passes into the colon: Both soluble and insoluble fiber have specific effects on the colon. Soluble fiber acts as a prebiotic, feeding the beneficial bacteria in the gut and contributing to the production of short-chain fatty acids. These fatty acids serve as an energy source for the colon cells and have anti-inflammatory properties, promoting overall gut health. Insoluble fiber adds bulk to the stool and helps retain water, promoting regular bowel movements and preventing constipation. 10. The food is expelled from the body: High fiber foods, specifically insoluble fiber, promote regular bowel movements by increasing stool bulk and softening the stool, which makes it easier to pass. In conclusion, high fiber foods have both direct and indirect effects on the digestive process. Most of these effects are beneficial, such as improving gut health, promoting satiety, and regulating bowel movements. However, some drawbacks may include reduced absorption of certain nutrients and possible abdominal discomfort for those not accustomed to a high-fiber diet. It is essential to gradually increase fiber intake and ensure adequate hydration to minimize any adverse effects."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

It seems like a statement or title to a concept rather than a standard sentence that would require punctuation. The punctuation essentially depends on the sense you want to convey. If you are trying to denote that Salinas, Ecuador has cheap prices, the sentence could need a comma for clarification: \\"Cheap Prices in Salinas, Ecuador\\". This is because the comma separates the city (Salinas) from the country (Ecuador), which is standard punctuation in geography.

Input: Article: Many university students dislike studying history because there is little to get excited about when historical events are presented in a boring manner. However, I'll never forget my American History professor, Dr. Williamson. Each event leaped from the pages of our text and became as real as the daily news report on the radio.  My favorite lecture concerned the American Revolution. Dr. Williamson set the mood for the study by imitating Pall Revere, a well-known silversmith, working in his shop. The American colonists were angry because of the British control over their lives. Revere felt that war between the British and the colonists was inevitable. Then, Dr Williamson told us about Revere rowing across the Charles River from Boston on April 18,1775. I could see the professor row as he raised his hand to his forehead as if he were looking across the Charles River to the old North Church in Boston. Suddenly, Revere spotted two lanterns, a signal which meant that the British would attack by sea. He jumped on his horse to warn the villagers of the attack.  Professor Williamson reminded us that the first battles of the American Revolution were fought at Concord and Lexington, Massachusetts, the year before the Declaration of Independence was signed in 1776. Never before had history seemed so alive to me. And all because a professor cared enough to put his heart into his teaching.

After observing Geek solemnly reflecting in the shack, he realizes that Geek is actually Z and asks him to teach him how to surf.

Summarize this article in one sentence. A trail of death and destruction was left across the 4,000 villages of Rudraprayag district when floods engulfed the famous Hindu shrine of Kedarnath. At least 5,700 people missing were presumed dead while more than 540 bodies recovered from the mountains were buried in the aftermath. A year later, skeletons of missing people continue to be found. Sanjay Sharma, a pilgrim from Delhi, says news of 12 more bodies found in the Kedarnath valley last week have made him afraid. \\"Naturally I am scared and am planning to wind up the trip in a few days. Looking at the debris, I am sure many more bodies would be buried right here,\\" he said. Rudraprayag District Magistrate Raghav Langar says the government has constituted a special force for intensive combing operations to find the thousands who are still missing. \\"We may find more bodies in the coming weeks as snow has begun to melt, and with the onset of the monsoon they are likely to come to the surface,\\" he told reporters on Sunday. There was compensation for bereft families and the temple reopened for prayers last September. But despite a year of relief and reconstruction efforts by the government and aid agencies, many of the villages which were completely washed away by the surging waters of Mandakani river remain cut off. For the thousands who were displaced and provided shelter by the government in various towns, it appears a long wait to return home. \\"I lost my home and a few relatives in the floods but have suffered more in the last few months. My tea stall has no visitors and tourists are absent this year. How will my family survive?\\" asked Proornanand Bhatt, a resident of Rudraprayag. Every summer, hundreds of thousands of devout Hindus make a pilgrimage to the Kedarnath shrine as part of the Himalayan Char Dham Yatra (Four pilgrimages) to four temple towns in Uttarakhand. Badrinath, Yamunotri and Gangotri are the other three pilgrimage spots. But that was until last year. Fear appears to have kept away those who have been regulars to this region this year, affecting local businesses badly - the only means of livelihood for hundreds of people living in the higher mountains. Newly constructed roads leading up to Guptakashi, near Kedarnath, are empty and so are the hundreds of lodges and hotels lined up next to the river. \\"I'll give you an 80% discount over the regular room rates if you stay with us,\\" a tourist lodge owner pleaded with us in Guptakashi. The temple town of Kedarnath, meanwhile, continues to resemble a ghost town with hundreds of damaged homes and lodges covered with boulders, mud and silt. An expensive chopper ride from Guptakashi remains the only way to reach the shrine and the temple compound is the only place of any visible activity. Some, however, have returned to offer prayers for having survived last year when a glacial lake above the town burst after days of heavy rainfall. Janardan Rai and wife Anjula were only a few miles away from the shrine when news of the flooding reached them. \\"It was God's wish that we are alive. So we are here to thank him and offer prayers. I agree things here are in a bad shape, but that should not come in the way of faith,\\" Mr Rai said. The government of Uttarakhand, meanwhile, has been working hard to restore normalcy to the affected areas and work is going on to repair damaged roads and bridges. In a bid to woo more pilgrims, the government is offering cheap accommodation and food to pilgrims who wish to visit the shrines in the near future. But with the entire economy of Uttarakhand so heavily dependent on religious tourism over decades, this appears to be a race against time.

Question: Here's a complex question that requires someone to reason about the input, can you answer it? Are William Goyen and Joe R. Lansdale both writers? Answer:","output":"Yes, both William Goyen and Joe R. Lansdale are writers. They each have distinctly different styles, backgrounds, and contributions to the world of literature, as well as unique places in American literary history. William Goyen was an American writer born in 1915 in Texas, and he passed away in 1983. He is primarily known for his novels, short stories, and contributions to the Southern Gothic literary tradition. One of his most famous works is his debut novel \\"The House of Breath\\" (1950), which tells an emotionally resonant story about the people living in a small Texas town. This novel, like many of Goyen's other works, contains a lyrical, poetic, and avant-garde approach to language and storytelling. He is also known for his collections of short stories like \\"Ghost and Flesh\\" (1952) and \\"The Faces of Blood Kindred\\" (1960). With a particular interest in exploring themes of memory, identity, and the human condition, Goyen's works often delve into the complexities of human relationships and the impact of the past on our present lives. Joe R. Lansdale, on the other hand, was born in 1951, also in Texas, and is still an active writer today. Lansdale's writing spans several genres, including (but not limited to) mystery, suspense, horror, science fiction, and even Westerns. Known for his eclectic storytelling style, Lansdale is often praised for his ability to create vivid and memorable characters, unique settings, and engaging plots. Among his most notable works is the Hap and Leonard series, which began with \\"Savage Season\\" in 1990 and continues to this day. These crime novels feature the private investigators Hap Collins and Leonard Pine, whose adventures showcase Lansdale's penchant for dark humor, sharp dialogue, and evocative descriptions. Lansdale has also published numerous standalone novels, short stories, and comic books, adapting some of his own works to the graphic novel format. His works my often blend multiple genres, combining elements such as supernatural, noir, and action to create a fresh and often unique narrative experience. In conclusion, both William Goyen and Joe R. Lansdale are indeed writers, each having left their own distinct marks on the landscape of American literature. While their styles, genres, and themes might differ significantly, it is this rich diversity of voices that contributes to the continued vibrancy and evolution of the literary world."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

In the postulated homeland region (present-day Ukraine), they had contacts with the Iranic Sarmatians and the Germanic Goths. After their subsequent spread, they began assimilating non-Slavic peoples. For example, in the Balkans, there were Paleo-Balkan peoples, such as Romanized and Hellenized (Jireček Line) Illyrians, Thracians and Dacians, as well as Greeks and Celtic Scordisci. Over time, due to the larger number of Slavs, most descendants of the indigenous populations of the Balkans were Slavicized. The Thracians and Illyrians vanished from the population during this period – although the modern Albanian nation claims descent from the Illyrians. Exceptions are Greece, where the lesser numbered Slavs scattered there came to be Hellenized (aided in time by more Greeks returning to Greece in the 9th century and the role of the church and administration) and Romania where Slavic people settled en route for present-day Greece, Republic of Macedonia, Bulgaria and East Thrace whereby the Slavic population had come to assimilate. Bulgars were also assimilated by local Slavs but their ruling status and subsequent land cast the nominal legacy of Bulgarian country and people onto all future generations. The Romance speakers within the fortified Dalmatian cities managed to retain their culture and language for a long time, as Dalmatian Romance was spoken until the high Middle Ages.

Please answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who planned to work with his longtime librettist? , can you please find it?   The one-act opera genre had become increasingly popular in Italy following the 1890 competition sponsored by publisher Edoardo Sonzogno for the best such work, which was won by the young Pietro Mascagni's Cavalleria rusticana. With Tosca essentially completed by November 1899, Puccini sought a new project. Among sources he considered, before proceeding with Madama Butterfly, were three works by French dramatist Alphonse Daudet that Puccini thought might be made into a trilogy of one-act operas.After Butterfly premiered in 1904, Puccini again had difficulty finding a new subject. He further considered the idea of composing three one-act operas to be performed together, but found his publisher, Giulio Ricordi, firmly opposed to such a project, convinced that it would be expensive to cast and produce. The composer then planned to work with his longtime librettist, Giuseppe Giacosa, on an opera about Marie Antoinette, a project frustrated by the librettist's illness. Puccini wrote in November 1905, \\"Will we go back to it? [Maria Antonietta] If I find three one-act works that suit me, I'll put off M.A.\\"  Puccini pursued neither project, as Giacosa's illness led to his death in September 1906.In March 1907, Puccini wrote to Carlo Clausetti, Ricordi's representative in Naples, proposing three one-act operas based on scenes from stories by Russian novelist Maxim Gorky. By May the composer had set aside this proposal to concentrate on the project which became La fanciulla del West, although he did not wholly abandon the idea of a multiple-opera evening. His next idea in this vein, some years later, was for a two-opera bill, one tragic and one comic; he later expanded this to include a third opera with a mystic or religious tone. By November 1916 Puccini had completed the \\"tragic\\" element, which became Il tabarro, but he still lacked ideas for the other two works. He considered staging Il tabarro in combination with his own early work Le Villi, or with other two-act operas which might be used to round out the evening's...

The law of criminal procedure in the United States consists of a massive overlay of federal constitutional case law interwoven with the federal and state statutes that actually provide the foundation for the creation and operation of law enforcement agencies and prison systems as well as the proceedings in criminal trials. Due to the perennial inability of legislatures in the U.S. to enact statutes that would actually force law enforcement officers to respect the constitutional rights of criminal suspects and convicts, the federal judiciary gradually developed the exclusionary rule as a method to enforce such rights. In turn, the exclusionary rule spawned a family of judge-made remedies for the abuse of law enforcement powers, of which the most famous is the Miranda warning. The writ of habeas corpus is often used by suspects and convicts to challenge their detention, while the Civil Rights Act of 1871 and Bivens actions are used by suspects to recover tort damages for police brutality. Is there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \\"unanswerable\\"): What acts cover tort damages from police brutality cases?","output":"The question can be answered. In the United States, two primary legal actions cover tort damages from police brutality cases: the Civil Rights Act of 1871 and Bivens actions. 1. The Civil Rights Act of 1871 (42 U.S.C. § 1983): This federal statute allows individuals to sue government officials, including police officers, for violations of their constitutional rights. Victims of police brutality can seek compensatory and punitive damages under this statute. The purpose of this act is to hold state and local government officials accountable for unlawful actions that infringe on an individual's rights. 2. Bivens actions: Bivens v. Six Unknown Named Agents (403 U.S. 388) is a 1971 U.S. Supreme Court case that established the right to sue federal agents personally for damages caused by a violation of constitutional rights. A Bivens action allows individuals to seek damages for police brutality committed by federal law enforcement officers. Similar to a § 1983 claim, a Bivens action can result in compensatory and punitive damages. These two legal actions provide individuals with avenues to seek tort damages for police brutality cases, regardless of whether the law enforcement officers involved are part of state, local, or federal agencies."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

With QB Josh McCown out with an injury, QB Daunte Culpepper got a chance to get redemption against his former team.  The game was delayed for 30 minutes due to thunderstorms in the Miami area. In the first quarter, Oakland got off to a fast start with Culpepper completing a 7-yard TD pass to WR Jerry Porter, along with getting a 2-yard TD run.

U.S. voters head to the polls in November for a high-stakes congressional midterm election in which Republican control of both the House of Representatives and the Senate appears to be in jeopardy. The outcome of the elections could have a profound impact on U.S. President Donald Trump as well, and the president is starting to take notice. At a recent campaign-style rally in Washington, Michigan, Trump turned up the heat on opposition Democrats: \\"A vote for a Democrat in November is a vote for open borders and crime. It's very simple,\\" he said. Opinion polls give Democrats an edge looking ahead to the balloting in November, and Trump is trying to get his supporters excited about turning out at the polls. \\"You know what it is? You get complacent,\\" he said. \\"We cannot be complacent. We have to go out, right?\\" The president also told supporters not to pay attention to Democrats who insist they have the House all but won in November. \\"We've got to go out and we've got to fight like hell and we have got to win the House and win the Senate,\\" Trump told the audience. \\"And I think we are going to do great in the Senate and I think we are going to do great in the House because the economy is so good.\\" According to the website RealClearPolitics, the Democrats enjoy a generic ballot advantage of nearly 7 percentage points over the Republicans looking ahead to November.

A federal judge in New York sentenced three men to a minimum 25 years in prison on Wednesday for plotting to detonate bombs at two Bronx synagogues and attack a military base in New York. James Cromitie, Onta Williams and David Williams were arrested in 2009 after planting what they thought were live explosives. Laguerre Payen, a fourth member of the group who was arrested and tried together with the defendants, was not in the courtroom pending a psychological evaluation. In August, the jury spent six weeks listening to the testimony and undercover tapes from an FBI informant who posed as a Pakistani militant. After eight days of deliberations in October, the defendants were convicted on seven of eight counts, including conspiracy and attempts to use and acquire weapons of mass destruction and anti-aircraft missiles. Cromitie and Williams were also found guilty of attempting to kill officers and employees of the United States . In an emotional statement on Wednesday, Cromitie apologized to the people of United States, his family and friends. \\"I have never been a terrorist and I never will be a terrorist and everyone here knows that,\\" he said. David Williams and Onta Williams also apologized to their families and thanked supporters, and Onta apologized to the people of Riverdale. The prosecutors were pushing for life in prison for the three men. \\"What these three defendants did was as serious a set of offenses as is imaginable,\\" said Assistant U.S. Attorney David Raskin in court Wednesday. Members of the defense team argued during the trial that their clients were victims of entrapment.  The original sentencing was postponed from March 24 so the judge could hear defense arguments on the government's usage of a confidential informant in the case. \\"The real crime in this case is that the government was allowed to do something like this,\\" Suzanne Brody, attorney for Onta Williams, said after the sentencing.

LONDON, England (CNN) -- There is one man who will be pacing around the Hazeltine National Golf Club in Minnesota this week hoping to make it three majors in a row -- but you won't find his name when you trail your finger down the list of starters at the 91st PGA Championship. Tiger Woods possesses a mental toughness that none of his competitors can match. Though his presence may be unnoticed by spectators lining the fairways, his influence on the players he coaches is becoming far more conspicuous. That is because sports psychologist Dr. Morris Pickens, or \\"Dr Mo\\" as his players like to call him, is fast gaining a reputation for being one of the best mental coaches in golf. During practice rounds, OPTIONS: - 91st PGA Championship will spend around half a day with each of his players. - CNN will spend around half a day with each of his players. - Dr Mo will spend around half a day with each of his players. - England will spend around half a day with each of his players. - Hazeltine National Golf Club will spend around half a day with each of his players. - LONDON will spend around half a day with each of his players. - Lucas Glover will spend around half a day with each of his players. - Minnesota will spend around half a day with each of his players. - Morris Pickens will spend around half a day with each of his players. - Pickens will spend around half a day with each of his players. - Stewart Cink will spend around half a day with each of his players. - Tiger will spend around half a day with each of his players. - Tiger Woods will spend around half a day with each of his players. - Zach Johnson will spend around half a day with each of his players.","output":"During practice rounds, Dr Mo will spend around half a day with each of his players. This dedicated and personalized support allows him to assess their mental state, discuss their thoughts, feelings, and performance goals, and provide tips and strategies to help them maintain focus, overcome adversity, and maximize their potential on the golf course. Dr. Morris Pickens' roster of players is indeed impressive, as it includes some of the top names in professional golf like Lucas Glover, Stewart Cink, and Zach Johnson - all of whom have enjoyed significant successes in their careers. Many players credit Dr. Mo with helping them unlock their full capabilities, pointing to their improved mental stamina, increased self-confidence, and heightened ability to respond positively to pressure situations as key factors in their improved game. Dr. Mo's unique approach to sports psychology combines elements from various psychological theories and methodologies, along with insights drawn from his own experiences as an athlete and a student of the game. He is a firm believer in the power of visualization and positive thinking, which is why he encourages his players to imagine themselves winning and performing at their best in critical moments even before stepping onto the golf course. At the same time, he teaches them to be aware of and manage their emotions, particularly those that may prove detrimental to their performance, such as anger, frustration, or anxiety. The effectiveness of Dr. Mo's methods can be seen in tangible improvements in the performances of his players. For example, Glover and Cink both credit him for helping them win their respective major championships, attributing their mental resilience and focused energy during the tournaments to Dr. Mo's guidance. In addition, several other players have noted marked improvements in their overall consistency and competitiveness, as well as a newfound ability to bounce back from setbacks or difficult rounds. As Dr. Mo's reputation as one of the best mental coaches in golf continues to grow, it is not surprising that more and more players are seeking his assistance in refining their mental game. With the gap between the top golfers in the world becoming narrower, the importance of managing the psychological aspect of the sport cannot be overstated. Golf is just as much a mental game as it is a physical one, and players who can master both will consistently come out on top. Dr. Morris Pickens' proven ability to help players unlock their mental strength is thus an invaluable asset for these golfers, ensuring they remain at the pinnacle of their sport for years to come."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Despite its gold reserves of 106.3 million pounds, Russia's pre-war financial situation was not enviable. The country had large budget deficits year after year, and was largely dependent on borrowed money. Russia's war effort was funded primarily by France, in a series of loans totalling 800 million francs ; another loan in the amount of 600 million francs was agreed upon, but later cancelled. These loans were extended within a climate of mass bribing of the French press . Although initially reluctant to participate in the war, the French government and major banks were co-operative since it became clear that Russian and French economic interests were tied. In addition to French money, Russia secured a loan in the amount of 500 million marks  from Germany, who also financed Japan's war effort. Conversely, Japan's pre-war gold reserves were a modest 11.7 million pounds; a major portion of the total cost of the war was covered by money borrowed from the United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States.

Every year, many people in the world travel to this African country to watch the animals closely. But do you know how they travel? By bus--This is the most common way. When people get on a bus, they'll find that the bus is a little strange. It is different from the buses we often see. There are no big windows at all, but some small windows. And it looks like a cage. What are they used for? Oh, people can use it to watch animals, especially those dangerous animals, and take photos. We know that people are most interested in the lions. So when two buses meet , the drivers will stop and ask each other whether they have found lions. By boat--We can often see many people are in a boat, enjoying the beautiful scene along a river of a lake, and they can also enjoy hippos and crocodiles from a nearer distance. By hot balloon --In the early morning, when the sun is beginning to rise, a large hot balloon is also starting its journey. Taking a hot balloon makes most of the travelers excited.

UPDATED:. 15:15 EST, 13 August 2012. A bankrupt Pakistani man and his son managed to set up a business and cheat their local community out of almost £50,000 despite being in the UK illegally, a court heard. Siyed Asem, 58, and his son Syed Bukhari, 25, ran a corner shop and operated a Western Union money transfer service offering ‘excellent rates’ on transactions. But more than 20 customers who used the service to send money to India, Bangladesh and Pakistan, were left thousands of pounds out of pocket. Father and son partnership: Bankrupt Siyed Asem, left, and his son Syed Bukhari, right, together stole nearly £50,000 from their customers who had requested for the cash to be transferred to India. Jailing father and son for two years. each, Judge Jamie Tabor QC described their offences against their own. Asian community in Gloucester’s Barton area as ‘despicable.’ Judge. Tabor said it was ‘extraordinary’ that the men had been able to run a. shop and set up the money transfer business when they were both illegal. overstayers and Asem was bankrupt. Asem. came to the UK on a visitor’s permit eight years ago and never left. His son was in the UK on a student permit which would not allow him to. work or run a business. Gloucester crown court heard that the service operated legitimately at first but the pair soon started stealing the money - which amounted to a total of £48,206. One of their customers, retired Khadijabbi Mulla, lost £1,000 he requested to be transferred to India to pay for his operation there. Prosecutor Lisa Hennessy said: 'He was told it would take 8 weeks, which would take him close to the date of his operation. 'When he got to India he still had not received the promised PIN number to access his money. 'He. contacted a friend in Gloucester to ask him to complain and the message. he got back was that he would get a refund when he got back. Jailed: Siyed Asem and Syed Bukhari were sentenced to two years in prison at Gloucester Crown Court. 'He has never received a refund - as he puts it he has just had lots of excuses and delays.' Mrs Hennessy said another victim of the con, Fatima Kazi, paid the men £1,500 to be transferred to India to help fund the building of a mosque in her late father’s memory. Mrs Hennessy continued: 'The money never arrived.' She detailed how other customers lost money in similar transactions - Runara Begum and her husband lost almost £5,500 which was supposed to be going to Bangladesh; Rashid Salloo lost £1,000 destined for India; Yusuf Chand transferred £7,000 to India in two transactions but it never arrived. There were other customers who had transferred significant sums and either received nothing or were given very small refunds, she added. Mrs Hennessy said all the offences occurred within a few months between late 2010 and early 2011 after Bukhari applied in October 2010 to become an agent for Finit UK, a Western Union money transfer company. The application was granted and he was approved after ‘various checks had been carried out’. Mrs Hennessy told the court the fact that both men were illegal immigrants didn't appear to 'have come up on the checks'. She added that they also failed to notice that Asem had been made bankrupt in 2008. Fraud: The pair set up a Western Union money transfer service but stole thousands of pounds from customers that was meant to be sent to India. Bukhari admitted 11 offences of fraud - of masking false representations to customers that his money transfer business was in a sound financial position and that money would be transferred at a preferential rate of exchange - between January and March 2011. Asem admitted 12 similar charges. Mrs Hennessy said Bukhari was responsible for £33,688 of the total fraud and Asem £14,518. Sabhia Pathan, defending, said Bukhari had come to Britain legitimately to study to be a chartered accountant but had started working at McDonald’s to earn some money and then had opened the shop with his father. Asem had trusted his son’s business acumen and joined him in the venture but the money transfer service had quickly gone wrong because they were offering such good exchange rates that they made no profit, she said. Ms Pathan said that Western Union had checked only Bukhari’s credit rating before allowing him to set up the service. She added that both men knew they were facing deportation after their sentences and Asem was fearful of going back to Pakistan because he has health problems which are better treated here. Despite his status he has been getting free medication, she said. Jailing the men, Judge Tabor said: 'Over a period of three months you stole just under £50,000 from many members of your local community. 'That money was entrusted to you to transfer abroad for a variety of purposes including allowing people to have operations and to help with a mosque and other charitable tasks. 'People trusted you, especially you, father, because of the seniority that you held. I accept that when you started this business in November you ran it legitimately for a short period of time. 'But by the middle of January you were nothing more or less than confidence tricksters. You have done considerable damage to your community and you know it. 'These were despicable offences.' He told them police will now investigate their finances to see what can be confiscated from them under the Proceeds of Crime Act.","output":"A man from Pakistan and his son had a little store in the UK, even though they weren't allowed to be there. They also had a money transfer business that let people send money to other countries like India, Bangladesh, and Pakistan. But instead of sending the money, they kept it for themselves. They took almost £50,000 from over 20 people who trusted them.  A judge said this was very bad and sent them to jail for two years. After they finish their time in jail, they might have to go back to their own country. The police will also try to get the stolen money back from them."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

Title: Wonder Boys Movie plot: Professor Grady Tripp (Michael Douglas) is a novelist who teaches creative writing at an unnamed Pittsburgh university (the movie was shot chiefly in and around Carnegie Mellon). He is having an affair with the university chancellor, Sara Gaskell (Frances McDormand), whose husband, Walter (Richard Thomas), is the chairman of the English department in which Grady is a professor. Grady's third wife, Emily, has just left him, and he has failed to repeat the grand success of his first novel, published years earlier. He continues to labor on a second novel, but the more he tries to finish it the less able he finds himself to invent a satisfactory ending. The book runs to over two and a half thousand pages and is still far from finished. He spends his free time smoking marijuana. Grady's students include James Leer (Tobey Maguire) and Hannah Green (Katie Holmes). Hannah and James are friends and both very good writers. Hannah, who rents a room in Grady's large house, is attracted to Grady, but he does not reciprocate. James is enigmatic, quiet, dark and enjoys writing fiction more than he first lets on. During a party at the Gaskells' house, Sara reveals to Grady that she is pregnant with his child. Grady finds James standing outside holding what he claims to be a replica gun, won by his mother at a fairground during her schooldays. However, the gun turns out to be very real, as James shoots the Gaskells' dog when he finds it attacking Grady. James also steals a very valuable piece of Marilyn Monroe memorabilia from the house. Grady is unable to tell Sara of this incident as she is pressuring him to choose between her and Emily. As a result, Grady is forced to keep the dead dog in the trunk of his car for most of the weekend. He also allows James to follow him around, fearing that he may be depressed or even suicidal. Gradually, he realizes that much of what James tells him about himself and his life is untrue, and is seemingly designed to elicit Grady's sympathy.

Step 2: Introduce the characters - Paul and Amanda Kirby: A seemingly wealthy couple - Detective Alex Foster: A seasoned NYPD investigator - Elizabeth Whitman: A journalist covering the story - Charles and Isabella Harrington: Friends of the Kirby family Step 3: Create the main plot The movie begins with an impressive fundraiser hosted by Paul and Amanda Kirby at their opulent Manhattan penthouse. The event is attended by high-society members, including their friends Charles and Isabella Harrington. As the guests settle, they are captivated by the incredible art collection and expensive furnishings, as well as the elegance of the couple. However, something feels off about the couple - their story has inconsistencies and their past is shrouded in mystery. Step 4: Introduce the conflict A week after the fundraiser, a major art heist occurs in the city. Several valuable paintings are stolen, including an artwork that was displayed at the Kirby's penthouse during the event. Suspicion rises, and Detective Alex Foster is assigned to the case. Journalist Elizabeth Whitman also takes an interest in the case, as she recalls interviewing Paul and Amanda at the fundraiser and noting their peculiar behavior. Step 5: Investigate the leads Detective Foster and Elizabeth separately start uncovering details about the Kirby's past. They discover that Paul and Amanda are not who they claim to be – they are, in fact, impostors who stole the real Paul and Amanda's identity to gain access to high society. Step 6: Explore subplots - Foster and Elizabeth begin to develop feelings for each other as they work towards solving the case. - Charles and Isabella are revealed to be part of an international crime syndicate that deals in stolen art. - The real Paul and Amanda were killed and replaced by the impostors to initiate the heist.

With the help of back-up from his precinct, Detective Foster apprehends the criminals, retrieving the stolen art and avenging the real Kirby couple. Step 8: Resolution The conspirators are charged, and the stolen art is returned to its rightful owners. Foster and Elizabeth acknowledge their feelings for each other, and their shared experience brings them closer together. The events prompt societal elites to reevaluate their lives and the value they place on material goods. Consequently, they become more aware of their surroundings and the intentions of those around them.

Kathleen Mary Ferrier, CBE (22 April 1912 – 8 October 1953) was an English contralto singer who achieved an international reputation as a stage, concert and recording artist, with a repertoire extending from folksong and popular ballads to the classical works of Bach, Brahms, Mahler and Elgar. Her death from cancer, at the height of her fame, was a shock to the musical world and particularly to the general public, which was kept in ignorance of the nature of her illness until after her death. The daughter of a Lancashire village schoolmaster, Ferrier showed early talent as a pianist, and won numerous amateur piano competitions while working as a telephonist with the General Post Office. She did not take up singing seriously until 1937, when after winning a prestigious singing competition at the Carlisle Festival she began to receive offers of professional engagements as a vocalist. Thereafter she took singing lessons, first with J.E. Hutchinson and later with Roy Henderson. After the outbreak of the Second World War Ferrier was recruited by the Council for the Encouragement of Music and the Arts (CEMA), and in the following years sang at concerts and recitals throughout the UK. In 1942 her career was boosted when she met the conductor Malcolm Sargent, who recommended her to the influential Ibbs and Tillett concert management agency. She became a regular performer at leading London and provincial venues, and made numerous BBC radio broadcasts. In 1946, Ferrier made her stage debut, in the Glyndebourne Festival premiere of Benjamin Britten's opera The Rape of Lucretia. A year later she made her first appearance as Orfeo in Gluck's Orfeo ed Euridice, a work with which she became particularly associated. By her own choice, these were her only two operatic roles.
