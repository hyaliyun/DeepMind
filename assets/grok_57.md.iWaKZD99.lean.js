Provide a detailed article with actionable tips.","output":"Sure, I can help you with that. Here's a concise yet detailed article with actionable tips on reducing your carbon footprint. How to Reduce Your Carbon Footprint: Tips for Individuals A carbon footprint is the amount of greenhouse gases emitted by an individual, household, organization, or activity. These gases, including carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O), trap heat in the atmosphere and cause global warming. To mitigate climate change, everyone needs to reduce their carbon footprint. Here are some tips that individuals can adopt. 1. Reduce Energy Use One of the most important ways to reduce your carbon footprint is to minimize your energy consumption. Energy production is a major source of greenhouse gas emissions, mainly from burning fossil fuels like coal, oil, and natural gas. You can reduce your energy use by: - Turning off lights, appliances, and electronics when not in use. - Using energy-efficient products like LED light bulbs, smart thermostats, and Energy Star rated appliances. - Installing insulation, weatherstripping, and double-pane windows to improve home energy efficiency. - Using public transportation, biking, walking, or carpooling instead of driving alone. - Flying less, choosing fuel-efficient airlines, and purchasing carbon offsets for your flights. 2. Conserve Water Another way to reduce your carbon footprint is to use water more efficiently. Water requires energy to pump, treat, and transport, and wastewater treatment releases greenhouse gases like CH4 and N2O. To conserve water, you can: - Repair leaks in faucets, toilets, and irrigation systems. - Install low-flow or aerated showerheads and faucets. - Use a dual-flush or low-flush toilet or put a water dam in the tank. - Plant drought-resistant native plants and use mulch to reduce evaporation. - Collect rainwater in a barrel or cistern for outdoor watering. 3. Reduce Waste Waste disposal also contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, mainly from landfills where organic materials like food waste decompose and produce CH4. To reduce waste and emissions, you can: - Recycle paper, plastic, metal, and glass as much as possible. - Compost food waste, yard trimmings, and leaves into a nutrient-rich soil amendment. - Avoid single-use products like disposable cups, plates, utensils, and bags. - Bring your own reusable bags, water bottles, coffee cups, and containers. - Donate or sell items that you no longer need. 4. Eat a Low-Carbon Diet What you eat can also affect your carbon footprint. Agriculture and food production are responsible for a significant amount of greenhouse gas emissions, mainly from deforestation, livestock, and fertilizer use. To reduce your food-related emissions, you can: - Eat a plant-based diet or reduce the amount of meat, dairy, and eggs in your diet. - Choose organic, local, and seasonal produce when possible. - Avoid food waste by planning meals, storing food properly, and freezing leftovers. - Use your own reusable bags, containers, and utensils for grocery shopping and takeout. - Purchase products from companies that have sustainable and ethical practices. 5. Support Climate Action Finally, as an individual, you can support climate action and advocacy to promote sustainable policies and technologies. You can: - Vote for political candidates who prioritize climate change and environmental protection. - Educate yourself and others about climate science, impacts, and solutions. - Join or support environmental organizations, movements, and initiatives. - Invest in clean energy and sustainable companies, funds, or projects. - Encourage your workplace, school, or community to reduce its carbon footprint. By taking these steps, individuals can reduce their carbon footprint and contribute to a sustainable and livable future. Every action counts, and collective efforts can make a significant difference in addressing climate change."},{"instruction":"Explain the difference between mitosis and meiosis.","output":"Mitosis is the process of cell division that results in the production of two identical daughter cells with the same number of chromosomes as the parent cell.

What do you think makes these instances so powerful? Write an article celebrating the best acts of sportsmanship in football history.","output":"Understood. Here is a concise response to your request: Instructions: Write an article celebrating the best acts of sportsmanship in football history. Article: Football or soccer is the most popular sport globally, and its popularity is largely due to the excitement that comes with it - winning, skill, and passion. However, beyond the game’s competitive nature, there have been moments where individuals or teams have shown another exceptional trait - sportsmanship. These acts aim to display respect for the opposing team and a fair play mentality that enhances the beauty of the game. Here are some of the best acts of sportsmanship in the history of football: 1. Pavel Nedved: EURO 2004 During the 2004 UEFA European Championship semi-final, Czech Republic was playing against Greece. In the 25th minute, Czech Republic midfielder Pavel Nedved was injured and was being carried off the pitch; however, he refused a stretcher, as he knew that his team had used all of their substitutes for the match. The Czech Republic, with ten players on the pitch, lost the semi-final match. 2. Devon Levesque: Florida High School In the game between Gainesville High School and North Marion High School in Florida in September 2018, North Marion High School player, Devon Levesque, got injured and was in severe pain. Despite no referee whistle, Gainesville High School’s players paused the game, took a knee and prayed for Devon, showing a rare moment of empathy and respect for the opposition. 3. Moya Dodd: FIFA Women’s World Cup 1995 Australia was playing against China in the FIFA Women’s World Cup 1995 when Chinese goalkeeper Gao Hong was injured. As the goalkeeper lay injured, Australian player, Moya Dodd, went over and offered her goalkeeper gloves to Gao Hong, an rival and opponent. 4. Johan Cruyff: World Cup 1974 In the World Cup 1974, the Netherlands played against Sweden. Swedish defender Jan Olsson fouled Cruyff, but instead of lashing out or complaining, Cruyff simply helps Olsson back to his feet, acknowledging the fair play mentality of football. 5. Philipp Lahm: UEFA Champions League Final 2012 During the 2012 UEFA Champions League Final, Bayern Munich’s captain, Philipp Lahm, went to console Chelsea’s crying player, Didier Drogba after his team had defeated him in a penalty shoot-out. Lahm's display of empathy towards his opponents was not only heartwarming but demonstrated that football is a sport where the opposition can be respected. The above acts of sportsmanship have shown that there are moments of compassion beyond the trophies and victories. What makes these instances so powerful is that they showcase the beautiful side of football, demonstrating that it is not just a game wrapped up in aggression, intensity, and physicality. Instead, football can shine lights of compassion, empathy, and sportsmanship, showcasing the best of human nature."},{"instruction":"Tweet: I'm so excited to try out this new restaurant for dinner tonight! #foodie #yum #cantwait OPTIONS: negative positive","output":"Positive."},{"instruction":"Brian: How do you make that sauce?

However, there is a growing concern about the potential negative impact that social media could have on mental health, including depression, anxiety, and low self-esteem. Therefore, the aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between social media use and mental health outcomes in young adults. Methods: The study will utilize a mixed-method approach, combining quantitative and qualitative research methods. The sample will consist of 500 young adults aged between 18-25 years, drawn from a variety of universities in the United States. The participants will be asked to complete a self-report questionnaire that includes measures of social media use (duration, frequency, and types of platforms used) and mental health outcomes (anxiety, depression, and self-esteem). Additionally, 50 participants will be selected for in-depth interviews to provide more detailed insights into the relationship between social media and mental health. Expected outcomes: Based on the existing literature, we expect to find a negative correlation between social media use and mental health outcomes. Specifically, we expect that high levels of social media use will be associated with higher levels of anxiety and depression, and lower levels of self-esteem. We also expect to find that certain types of social media platforms (e.g., Instagram, Snapchat) are more harmful than others (e.g., Twitter, LinkedIn). Conclusion: This study will provide valuable insights into the relationship between social media use and mental health in young adults. The results will have important implications for mental health practitioners, policy-makers, and social media platforms. The study will contribute to the growing body of knowledge on this subject and provide a basis for further research and interventions."},{"instruction":"Statement: The new restaurant on Main Street has received rave reviews from customers.

In 2010, the UN General Assembly passed a resolution that explicitly recognized \\"the right to safe and clean drinking water and sanitation as a human right that is essential for the full enjoyment of life and all human rights.\\" 2. Lack of access to clean water can have serious negative health consequences. According to the World Health Organization, contaminated drinking water can lead to the spread of waterborne diseases such as cholera, typhoid, and hepatitis A, which can be fatal. Children are particularly vulnerable, as diarrheal diseases caused by unsafe water and poor sanitation are one of the leading causes of death in children under five. 3. Access to clean water is linked to other human rights. Lack of access to water can impact an individual's ability to practice other basic human rights, such as the right to health, education, and adequate standards of living. For example, without access to clean water, individuals may be unable to attend school or work, or may suffer from malnutrition or dehydration. Overall, the recognition of access to clean water as a basic human right is supported by both international law and scientific evidence of the consequences of water contamination."},{"instruction":"Goal: how do you clean your room?

The results showed that those who took part in the program reported a significant reduction in symptoms of depression and anxiety, compared to those in a control group. Lead author Lara Aknin stated, \\"The results suggest that people can improve their mental health by simply focusing on the well-being of others.\\" This study highlights the benefits of practicing kindness and generosity towards others, and how doing so can positively impact an individual's mental health.

It is caused by a variety of factors, many of which are related to human activity. Understanding these causes is an important first step in addressing the problem and reducing the impact of air pollution on public health and the environment. One of the most common causes of air pollution in cities is vehicle emissions. Cars, trucks, and buses emit a range of pollutants, including carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxide, and particulate matter. These pollutants can have serious health impacts, including respiratory disease and heart problems. To reduce the impact of vehicle emissions, cities can invest in public transportation systems or promote alternative modes of transportation, such as cycling or walking. Industrial activity is another major contributor to air pollution in cities. Chemical plants, factories, and other industrial facilities release a range of pollutants into the air, including heavy metals, particulate matter, and volatile organic compounds. To reduce the impact of industrial activity on air quality, cities can enforce regulations and invest in cleaner technologies and processes. Construction activity is also a significant contributor to air pollution in cities. Demolition and excavation work can release dust and other particulate matter into the air, while construction equipment emits pollutants such as nitrogen oxide and diesel particulate matter. To mitigate the impact of construction activity, cities can require contractors to use dust suppression techniques and invest in cleaner equipment. Finally, natural factors such as wildfire smoke and dust storms can also contribute to air pollution in cities. While these factors may be outside of cities' control, they can still take steps to reduce their impact. For example, cities can invest in air quality monitoring systems and issue alerts or advisories when pollutant levels are elevated. In conclusion, air pollution in cities is caused by a range of human and natural factors, but many of these causes can be addressed through a combination of regulation, technology, and public policy. By taking decisive action to reduce the impact of air pollution, cities can help protect the health and wellbeing of their citizens and preserve the environment for future generations."},{"instruction":"Observation: The flowers are wilted.

This lack of regulation is particularly concerning when considering the potential risks of weight loss supplements. In addition, the supplement has not undergone any clinical trials. Clinical trials are essential for determining the safety and effectiveness of a new product. Without these trials, there is no way to know how the supplement will affect consumers in the long-term.

Solar panels are made up of many individual PV cells, which are wired together to form a larger unit. The panel is then mounted onto a structure, such as a roof or pole, where it can receive direct sunlight. The energy produced by the solar panels is typically stored in batteries, which can then be used as needed. In many cases, excess energy can also be sold back to the electric grid, providing a source of income for the owner of the solar panels.

The proposal has been met with resistance from some countries, including China and Brazil, who say that it would be unfair and might violate international trade rules. How would a carbon tax on imports work, and what are the arguments for and against it?","output":"The European Union is mulling over the idea of levying a tax on carbon emissions from imported goods to tackle climate change. However, this proposal is facing dissent from nations like China and Brazil who deem it unjust and possibly in contravention of international trade regulations. How would a carbon tax on imports function and what are the pros and cons associated with it? The execution of an import carbon tax would require all foreign goods to be subjected to the same carbon taxation as the products produced in the EU. This would mean that any country exporting goods to the EU, with a high carbon footprint, would incur extra costs, impairing their competitiveness. The money collected by the imposition of this tax could be directed towards green initiatives causing the demand for eco-friendly production to surge. Advocates of the proposal argue that if the economies without climate change regulations, alike in the US or China, do not take any actions to combat global warming, then their exports should be treated as if they are charged that green taxation. They contend that such an initiative would create a balance between the market and the environment, granting economic leverage to the greener companies that comply with the green regulations in Europe. Detractors claim that the imposition of a carbon tax on imports would increase specific goods' prices, leading to inflation and adversely affecting the poorest economies. They posit that some countries may manipulate their carbon taxes so that they aren't penalised making the entire process discriminatory. All in all, though the idea seeks to promote the protection of the environment, advocates of the proposal should invest in more comprehensive research regarding the likelihood of the imposition’s success, given the backlash from some countries. Further, more should be done to address concerns, such as the economic impacts of the proposal, to ensure equally beneficial outcomes."},{"instruction":"The Supreme Court of the United States is the highest federal court of the United States.

Under the new policy, people will need to show proof of vaccination either in the form of a physical card or a digital vaccine pass. The policy applies to anyone aged 12 and above who wants to participate in indoor activities. The city has given businesses a grace period until September 13th to start enforcing it. After that, any businesses that do not comply with the policy could face fines. The city has also launched an incentive program to encourage more people to get vaccinated. As part of the program, the city is giving out 100 to anyone who gets vaccinated at a city-run site. The incentive is available until August 31st. Mayor Bill de Blasio hopes that the new policy and incentive program will help the city reach a higher vaccination rate. Currently, about 65% of New Yorkers aged 12 and above are fully vaccinated. However, there are still many in the city who have not yet received the vaccine. The Mayor says that the city's new policy is not meant to discriminate against anyone but to protect public health.

Here are some possible arguments: For mandatory vaccination: - Vaccines are safe and effective at preventing serious diseases that can lead to disability or death, such as measles, whooping cough, or polio. When enough people get vaccinated, it creates herd immunity that protects those who cannot receive vaccines due to medical reasons. - Public schools are a common setting for infectious diseases to spread, as children are frequently in close contact with each other and with teachers. Requiring all children to be vaccinated would reduce the risk of outbreaks and protect the community as a whole. - Parents who refuse to vaccinate their children based on personal beliefs or misinformation put not only their own children but also others at risk of harm. Making vaccination mandatory is a justifiable measure to ensure that the health and well-being of all students are prioritized over individual preferences. Against mandatory vaccination: - Mandating vaccines violates parents' autonomy and freedom of choice to make medical decisions for their children. Some parents may have concerns about the safety, efficacy, or necessity of certain vaccines, or may have religious or philosophical objections to certain medical interventions. Forcing them to give their children vaccines they disagree with may cause distrust and resentment towards the medical establishment. - Vaccines are not risk-free, and some children may experience adverse reactions or side effects that are not always predictable or preventable. Mandating vaccination may thus expose children to unnecessary risks without their consent or without proper safeguards for monitoring and addressing adverse events. - Aside from vaccines, there are other ways to prevent infectious diseases, such as improving hygiene and nutrition, providing access to healthcare, and avoiding exposure to toxins and pollutants. A one-size-fits-all mandate for vaccines may overlook these broader determinants of health and may not be the most effective or equitable strategy for promoting public health."},{"instruction":"What is the sentiment of the following product review sentence? long battery life","output":"Neutral."},{"instruction":"Just got a promotion at work!

The study followed about 500,000 Chinese adults for seven years, and the results were quite surprising. Individuals who consumed spicy food about six to seven times a week had a 14% reduced risk of death compared to those who consumed spicy food less than once a week. The study has thrown light on the many health benefits of spicy food, particularly in improving immunity and circulation. Spices like chili pepper, turmeric, cinnamon, and black pepper are all known for their individual health benefits, and regular consumption of these spices in our diet can significantly boost our overall health and well-being. The findings of the study have led to further research that aims to establish the specific compounds or ingredients in spicy food that make it so beneficial to human health. Scientists believe that capsaicin, the compound that gives peppers their spiciness, is the key ingredient behind the health benefits of spicy food. Apart from adding great flavors to food, spicy food has several health benefits, including increased metabolism, reduced inflammation, and improved heart health. It is no wonder that many cultures across the world embrace spicy food as a staple part of their diet. In conclusion, the findings of the study are exciting and could potentially contribute to changing dietary habits, particularly in regions where spicy food is not commonly consumed.

Include tips on how to stay productive and motivated while working from home, and discuss the potential impact on company culture.","output":"Article: Remote work has grown in popularity as technology continues to improve and businesses become more flexible. Many people enjoy the convenience and freedom of working from home, while others struggle with the loss of traditional office culture and structure. In this article, we’ll explore some of the benefits and drawbacks of remote work, as well as possible ways to stay productive and motivated while working remotely. Benefits of Remote Work: 1. Flexibility – Remote work offers greater flexibility over traditional office jobs. You can work according to your own schedule, which is especially useful if you have other commitments like raising a family or taking care of elderly parents. You also have a greater degree of control over your work environment, which can help you be more productive. 2. Cost savings – Without a daily commute, you can save money on gas, parking, and public transit expenses. You can also save money on food and clothing costs. 3. Fewer distractions – Without the constant noise and interruptions of a traditional office, you can focus more on your work and get more done. 4. Greater potential for work-life balance – Remote work allows you to schedule your work around your personal life. This means that you can attend your child’s school events or doctor’s appointments without having to ask for time off from work. Drawbacks of Remote Work: 1. Isolation – Remote work can be lonely, especially if you are used to working in a team environment. You may miss the social interaction and sense of belonging that you experience in a traditional office. 2. Lack of structure – Without a boss or supervisor nearby to keep you on task, it can be easy to lose focus or procrastinate. 3. Distractions at home – Working from home can be full of distractions – children, pets, household chores, etc. – that can interrupt your work and make it harder to stay focused. 4. Communication challenges – Without in-person communication, misunderstandings can arise, and it can be harder to build relationships with colleagues. Tips for Staying Productive and Motivated While Working Remotely: 1. Set a schedule – Create a routine for yourself and stick to it. Start work at the same time every day, take regular breaks, and end your workday at a set time. 2. Create a dedicated workspace – Make sure you have a designated workspace where you can focus on work without distractions from family members or roommates. 3. Stay connected – Schedule regular check-ins with your manager or colleagues, and take advantage of video conferencing software to maintain effective communication. 4. Take breaks – It’s essential to take regular breaks to avoid burnout and keep your mind fresh. 5. Get out of the house – Working from home all the time can be isolating. Make an effort to get out of the house and interact with other people on a regular basis. Potential Impact on Company Culture: Remote work can have a significant impact on company culture, as it can be harder to build and maintain relationships between team members who are not physically in the same location. To mitigate this, companies can take steps like organizing virtual team-building activities and fostering communication channels that promote collaboration and transparency. It’s also important for managers to ensure that remote workers feel included and supported, even if they are not in the same physical location. In conclusion, remote work offers both benefits and drawbacks. By following some of the tips discussed in this article, remote workers can stay productive and motivated while enjoying the flexibility that working from home offers. Companies can also adapt their practices to ensure that remote workers feel supported and included in the company culture, even if they are not physically present."},{"instruction":"What is the Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, Angelicum in Rome affiliated with?","output":"The Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, Angelicum in Rome is affiliated with the Catholic Church."},{"instruction":"A: I think this sandwich is really good.

The Category 4 hurricane, which had sustained winds of 150 mph at landfall, was the strongest to hit the region since 1856. \\"The devastation is just catastrophic,\\" said Louisiana Governor John Bel Edwards, who declared a state of emergency ahead of Laura's arrival. \\"We have many, many people whose lives are going to be changed for a long, long time.\\" Laura first made landfall near Cameron, Louisiana, around 1 a.m. local time, causing power outages, roof damage, and widespread flooding. The storm then moved northward through southwestern Louisiana, pummeling Lake Charles, a city of nearly 80,000 people, with fierce gusts and rain. Buildings were ripped apart, trees were uprooted, and debris was scattered across the streets. The sound of windows breaking, transformers exploding, and metal bending was heard throughout the night. \\"We rode out the storm at our house, and it was really scary,\\" said Samantha Fontenot, a Lake Charles resident. \\"Our roof started leaking, and we had water coming into the house. We had to put towels under doors to stop it.\\" As morning broke, a clearer picture of the devastation emerged. The storm surge, which reached up to 15 feet in some areas, had inundated coastal towns and caused widespread flooding. In Louisiana alone, over 500,000 households and businesses were without power, and more than 220,000 people had evacuated ahead of the storm. In Texas, where Laura made its second landfall near the border with Louisiana, residents also faced significant damage, including downed power lines and damaged buildings. Governor Greg Abbott urged Texans to be cautious and patient as emergency responders worked to assess and address the damage. \\"I want you to understand that we are dealing with an unprecedented hurricane,\\" Abbott said. \\"There will be challenges that we will have to overcome, but we will overcome them.\\" As of Friday, August 28, the death toll from Hurricane Laura stood at six, with thousands of people displaced and in need of shelter, water, and other assistance. State and federal officials, along with volunteer organizations, began to mobilize resources and supplies to affected areas, but the recovery effort is expected to take weeks, if not months. \\"We're in for a long haul here,\\" said Edwards. \\"It's going to be difficult, but I know that we're going to get through it.

Brown shares the findings of her six-year study on vulnerability, which was based on thousands of interviews and focused on what makes people feel connected and what makes them feel disconnected. According to Brown, vulnerability is the core of all emotions and feelings, including joy, love, and even shame and fear. In order to lead a wholehearted life and truly connect with others, it is necessary to embrace vulnerability and take risks. Brown also talks about how shame is the fear of disconnection, and how it is the most powerful of all human emotions. She argues that shame can only be combated by empathy, and that vulnerability is the key to building empathy and creating meaningful connections with others. Finally, Brown emphasizes that vulnerability is not weakness, but rather a sign of strength and courage.

Sadly, many people still believe that mental illness is a sign of weakness, or that individuals living with these challenges are somehow dangerous or undesirable. This stigma can create shame and isolation, and can prevent people from seeking the support that they need. Another significant challenge is that many countries lack the adequate mental health resources needed to support people with these challenges. In some regions, there simply are not enough mental health professionals to provide care to all those who need it. In other parts of the world, access to treatments like medications or therapy may be restricted due to financial or logistical barriers. So how can we better support those struggling with mental illness? One critical step is to work harder to fight stigma and discrimination surrounding these conditions. This means challenging harmful stereotypes and speaking out when we see others unfairly judging or ostracizing people with mental health challenges. By working together to create a more open and accepting culture around mental health, we can help ensure that people feel more comfortable seeking the support they need. Another step is to invest in expanding access to mental health resources. This could mean training more mental health professionals, expanding access to affordable counseling services, or making medications and other treatments more affordable and accessible. By prioritizing mental health care as a key aspect of overall public health, we can help ensure that more people can access treatment and support when they need it. Finally, it is important to recognize that supporting mental health is not just the job of governments and health care systems. Each of us can do our part to help individuals who are struggling. This means reaching out to friends or family members who may be struggling, listening without judgment, and providing empathy and support. By working together at all levels, we can help ensure that people with mental health challenges receive the care and support they need to live healthy, fulfilling lives."},{"instruction":"What are the key takeaways from this selfhelp book on productivity?","output":"I'm sorry, but without the specific title of the self-help book you are referring to, I am unable to provide you with the key takeaways.

The law will apply to straws, cutlery, plates, and other items that are often discarded after just one use. The goal is to reduce waste and promote more environmentally friendly alternatives.","output":"Recently, a new law has been implemented throughout a European country, aiming to eliminate single-use plastics. This ban will cover a wide range of disposable items that are frequently discarded, including straws, plates, and cutlery. The primary objective of this legislation is to reduce the amount of waste that ends up in landfills, oceans, and other ecosystems, promoting more environmentally friendly alternatives. Plastic pollution has become one of the most significant environmental challenges of our time. Single-use plastics, particularly those commonly used in everyday life, contribute to this global crisis. For example, plastic straws, which are often not recyclable, can take hundreds of years to decompose. Over time, they break into small pieces, which then enter food chains, harming wildlife and damaging their habitats. The new law aims to address this issue by banning single-use plastics such as straws, plates, and cutlery. This measure will contribute significantly towards reducing the plastic waste generated by individuals, businesses, and other commercial operations. Additionally, the ban is expected to encourage people to use more sustainable alternatives, thereby reducing environmental impacts. It's worth noting that this law follows on from previous efforts to address plastic pollution. Over recent years, several countries and organizations have introduced campaigns to reduce single-use plastics and other types of plastic waste. These efforts have been driven by the need to address the environmental damage caused by plastic pollution, which can end up harming wildlife, entering food chains, and contaminating ecosystems. Overall, this new law to ban single-use plastics represents an essential step forward in addressing the issue of plastic pollution. By targeting everyday items that are frequently discarded, it should help to reduce waste and promote environmentally-friendly alternatives. While this legislation may cause some initial inconvenience, it is a necessary move towards protecting our planet's fragile ecosystems. As individuals, we can also play our part in supporting this initiative by switching to reusable and sustainable products, reducing our reliance on single-use plastics, and contributing towards a cleaner, healthier planet."},{"instruction":"What is the effect of the following sentence?

Australia's government has pledged 2 billion to protect the reef over the next decade.","output":"The Great Barrier Reef, one of the world's most enormous coral reef systems, is under threat like never before. Over the past few years, the reef has experienced an unprecedented coral bleaching phenomenon. Bleaching occurs when the water temperature rises above normal levels, causing the coral to expel essential algae it depends on as a source of nutrition. These algae are essential to the coral's existence, as they play a key role in its growth and survival. The Great Barrier Reef has experienced four major coral bleaching events in the past, but none as significant as the current one. The reef's northern section has been severely affected, with around 60% of the area being hit by bleaching at least once since the outbreak began back in 2014. The southern part of the reef has also experienced significant coral bleaching over the past few years, with the most recent event occurring in early 2020. The biggest concern is that the reefs may never recover from the extensive damage caused by coral bleaching. This is because it takes years for coral to grow and develop, and with the increasing frequency and severity of bleaching events, the time for recovery is becoming shorter and shorter. Losing the Great Barrier Reef would be a significant blow to the world's wildlife, as it provides habitat for thousands of marine species. Australia's government has pledged 2 billion to protect the reef over the next decade. The money will be used to implement new measures to reduce pollution and improve water quality around the reef. This plan is the most significant investment in the reef's history and a significant step towards a sustainable future for the world's most exceptional coral reef system. In conclusion, the Great Barrier Reef's coral bleaching phenomenon is a concerning issue that must be addressed immediately. With adequate funding and collective action from all stakeholders, the Great Barrier Reef can be saved from deteriorating further.

It provides a standard interface for accessing and manipulating binary data in a way that is both efficient and easy to use. The DataBuffer concept is a core part of the Spring Framework's reactive programming model, which emphasizes asynchronous, non-blocking I/O operations and reactive streams. With DataBuffer, developers can streamline their code and ensure optimal performance when working with binary data in their Spring Boot applications."},{"instruction":"** in pathmatchers","output":"In Spring Boot, the double asterisk (**) in path matchers is used to match any number of path segments in a URL or URI path. It is a powerful feature that allows for flexible and dynamic URL mapping based on the path pattern specified. For example, a path matcher such as \\"/api/**\\" would match any URL that starts with \\"/api/\\", regardless of the number of additional path segments. This means that the following URLs would all be matched by this path matcher: - /api/ - /api/user - /api/user/123 - /api/user/123/orders The double asterisk can also be used in combination with other path pattern components, such as a specific path segment or a path variable. This allows for even more customization and fine-grained control over URL mapping in Spring Boot applications. It is important to note that the use of double asterisks in path matchers should be used judiciously, as it can cause performance issues if not used wisely. It is recommended to use more specific path matchers whenever possible to ensure optimal performance and avoid unintended matches."},{"instruction":"use ** in the middle of the path in pathmatchers","output":"Yes, you can use ** in the middle of the path in path matchers in Spring Boot. This is useful when you want to match any number of path segments between two known path segments. For example, let's say you have a REST API endpoint for retrieving a resource by ID, and the ID is embedded in the URL path. You could define the path matcher like this: \`\`\` @GetMapping(\\"/resources/**/{id}\\") public ResponseEntity<Resource> getResourceById(@PathVariable String id) { // code to retrieve resource by ID } \`\`\` With this path matcher, any URL that starts with \\"/resources/\\" and ends with the ID path segment will be matched, regardless of the number of path segments in between. For example: - /resources/123 - /resources/abc/def/ghi/123 Note that using ** in the middle of the path can result in many possible matches, which can be a performance concern. It's best to use this feature sparingly and only when absolutely necessary. If possible, it's generally better to use more specific path matchers to improve performance and avoid unintended matches."},{"instruction":"use ** in the middle of the pathmatchers in spring webflux","output":"Yes, you can use ** in the middle of the path matchers in Spring WebFlux, just as you can in Spring MVC. The ** wildcard character matches any number of path segments, so it's a powerful tool for flexible URL mapping. For example, you might want to match any URL that starts with \\"/api/\\" and ends with \\"/users/\\" followed by a user ID. You can do that with the following route definition: \`\`\` router.route(\\"/api/**/users/{userId}\\") .andRoute(RequestPredicates.GET(\\"/api/**/users/{userId}\\"), handler::getUserById) .andRoute(RequestPredicates.POST(\\"/api/**/users\\"), handler::createUser); \`\`\` In this example, the ** wildcard matches any number of path segments between \\"/api/\\" and \\"/users/\\". This means that the following URIs would all be matched by this route: - /api/v1/users/123 - /api/v1/admin/users/456 - /api/v1/public/users/customers/789 The key point to remember is that the use of wildcards in the middle of the path can lead to many more possible matches, which can be a performance concern.

The double asterisks in the middle of the path allow for any number of path segments between \\"/api/\\" and \\"admin\\", so the following URLs would all be matched: - /api/v1/admin/ - /api/v2/customers/admin/ - /api/v3/departments/sales/admin/ The second matcher (\`\\"/api/**/users/**\\"\`) matches any URL that starts with \\"/api/\\" and has a path segment containing \\"users\\". The double asterisks in the middle of the path allow for any number of path segments between \\"/api/\\" and \\"users\\", so the following URLs would all be matched: - /api/v1/users/ - /api/v2/customers/users/ - /api/v3/departments/sales/users/ The third matcher (\`\\"/api/**\\"\`) permits all access to any URL that starts with \\"/api/\\".

In this case, \`numbers\` is only being read, not modified or written, so using \`calldata\` is a more optimal choice.

On the other hand, \`transfer2()\` uses an explicit \`if\` statement, followed by a \`revert\` statement with a custom error event \`NotOwner\`. This syntax generally results in a slightly higher gas cost for deployment because more bytecode is generated due to the additional event definition and the combination of \`if\` and \`revert\` statements.

Die meisten Mikroorganismen (Mikroben) mit der Fähigkeit zur alkoholischen Gärung nutzen diesen Stoffwechselweg nur vorübergehend zur Energiegewinnung, wenn der zur Atmung benötigte Sauerstoff fehlt.', 'Die Nutzung der alkoholischen Gärung durch den Menschen zur Herstellung alkoholischer Getränke gab es schon in prähistorischer Zeit. In der heutigen Zeit dient die alkoholische Gärung außerdem der Umwandlung von Biomasse in Ethanol als sekundärer Energieträger.', 'Forschungsgeschichte.', 'Schon in vorgeschichtlicher Zeit erzeugten Jäger und Sammler alkoholische Getränke. 1815 stellte der französische Chemiker Joseph Louis Gay-Lussac erstmals die Brutto-Reaktionsgleichung für den Abbau von Glucose zu Ethanol auf. Danach entwickelten sich verschiedene Ansichten über den Ablauf der Gärung. Während in den 1830er Jahren Jöns Jakob Berzelius und Justus von Liebig mit der „mechanistischen Gärungstheorie“ bestimmten Stoffen eine katalysierende Wirkung zuschrieben, meinten Charles Cagniard-Latour, Theodor Schwann und Friedrich Traugott Kützing unabhängig voneinander, dass Lebewesen, nämlich Hefen, dafür verantwortlich seien. Louis Pasteur postulierte 1857 die „vitalistische Gärungstheorie“, der zufolge die alkoholische Gärung nur in Verbindung mit lebenden Zellen möglich sei.', 'Diese Kontroverse wurde am 11. Januar 1897 von dem Chemiker Eduard Buchner entschieden mit einer Publikation über den Nachweis der alkoholischen Gärung mittels zellfreien Hefeextrakts. Er machte den Stoff Zymase – nach aktuellem Wissen ein Gemisch verschiedener Enzyme – für die Umsetzung von Zucker zu Ethanol verantwortlich und erhielt 1907 den Nobelpreis für Chemie „für seine biochemischen Untersuchungen und die Entdeckung der zellfreien Gärung“. Nähere Untersuchungen durch Arthur Harden und William John Young führten zur Entdeckung eines phosphorylierten Zwischenprodukts: des Harden-Young-Esters, bekannt als Fructose-1,6-bisphosphat. Zusammen erhielten Harden und Hans von Euler-Chelpin 1929 für ihre „Forschung über die Zuckervergärung und deren Anteil der Enzyme an diesem Vorgang“ ebenfalls den Nobelpreis für Chemie. Nachdem Stück für Stück die Teilreaktionen aufgeklärt und Schemata für den Ablauf der Gärung entworfen wurden, identifizierte Otto Warburg den Cofaktor Nicotinamidadenindinukleotid (NADH) als essentiellen Bestandteil des Gärprozesses. Schon 1937 gelang Erwin Negelein und Hans Joachim Wulff die Kristallisation des Gärungsenzyms Alkoholdehydrogenase.', 'Weitere Forscher, die nach Buchner an der Aufdeckung der Enzymkette der alkoholischen Gärung mitwirkten, waren Carl Neuberg, Gustav Embden, Otto Fritz Meyerhof, Jakub Karol Parnas, Karl Lohmann sowie Gerty Cori und Carl Ferdinand Cori.', 'Die an der Gärung beteiligten Enzyme aus verschiedenen Spezies sind mittlerweile isoliert und biochemisch charakterisiert (pH-Optimum, Temperaturoptimum, Reaktionsgeschwindigkeit, Umsatzrate). Die Kristallstrukturanalyse gewährte einen ersten Einblick in ihre molekulare Raumstruktur. Es bestehen Erkenntnisse über die Reaktionsmechanismen. Alles in allem können Vergleiche zwischen den Spezies gezogen werden. Die entschlüsselten Gene, die die Baupläne für diese Enzyme enthalten, geben Aufschluss über die evolutionäre Herkunft und über ihre eventuelle ursprüngliche Funktion.', 'Die Rolle im Stoffwechsel.', 'Die alkoholische Gärung wird vor allem von Zuckerhefen betrieben, unter Sauerstoffmangel dient sie ihnen zur Energiegewinnung. Steht Sauerstoff zur Verfügung, bauen sie Zucker durch Zellatmung ab und gewinnen so die zum Leben benötigte Energie. Der Zucker wird dabei durch eine lange Reihe chemischer, enzymatischer (d. h. durch Enzyme katalysierter) Umsetzungen (Glykolyse – Citratzyklus – Atmungskette) unter Sauerstoffverbrauch vollständig zu Kohlendioxid und Wasser oxidiert. Steht kein Sauerstoff zur Verfügung, so haben die Hefen in der alkoholischen Gärung eine alternative Möglichkeit zur Energiegewinnung. Sie können aber damit – im Vergleich zur vollständigen Oxidation durch Zellatmung – wesentlich weniger Energie in Form von Adenosintriphosphat (ATP) aus Glucose gewinnen: Beim Abbau von einem Molekül Glucose können bei dessen vollständiger Oxidation 32 Moleküle ATP gewonnen werden, bei der alkoholischen Gärung dagegen nur zwei Moleküle ATP. Diese zwei ATP werden in der Glykolyse gewonnen, dem ersten Schritt in der Reaktionsfolge sowohl der Zellatmung als auch der Gärung. Die zwei weiteren Reaktionsschritte der Gärung und damit letztlich die Ethanolproduktion dienen nicht der Energiegewinnung, sondern der Regeneration des Cofaktors NAD+, der bei den enzymatischen Umsetzungen der Glykolyse verbraucht wird. Da NAD nur in begrenzten Mengen vorhanden ist, wird es durch die Gärungsenzyme aus dem reduzierten Zustand (NADH) durch Oxidation mit Acetaldehyd wieder in den oxidierten Zustand (NAD+) versetzt; der Acetaldehyd wird dabei zu Ethanol reduziert.', 'Hefen sind fakultative Anaerobier. Wenn Sauerstoff zur Verfügung steht, wird Glucose aerob verstoffwechselt, nämlich vollständig zu Kohlenstoffdioxid und Wasser oxidiert. Unter Luftabschluss müssen Hefen dagegen die alkoholische Gärung betreiben. Da bei dieser weit weniger Energie je Molekül umgesetzter Glucose erzeugt wird als bei der aeroben Atmung, steigt die Geschwindigkeit des Glucose-Umsatzes stark an, wodurch der geringere ATP-Gewinn je Molekül umgesetzter Glucose teilweise kompensiert wird. Dieses Phänomen wird Pasteur-Effekt genannt. Wegen der eingeschränkten Energiegewinnung wachsen und vermehren sich Hefen unter Luftabschluss weit weniger stark als bei Luftzutritt. Außerdem wirkt das entstehende Ethanol als Zellgift.', 'Wenn Hefen in einem Medium mit hoher Zuckerkonzentration wachsen und ihre Enzyme der Zellatmung dadurch überlastet sind, betreiben sie alkoholische Gärung, obwohl genügend Sauerstoff vorhanden ist. Die Hefen nehmen ständig den Zucker auf und verwerten ihn neben der Zellatmung zusätzlich durch Gärung. Es handelt sich hierbei um den Crabtree-Effekt.', 'Neben Hefearten betreiben auch manche Bakterien alkoholische Gärung. So nutzt \\"Sarcina ventriculi\\" den gleichen enzymatischen Weg wie Hefe, während \\"Zymomonas mobilis\\" einen alternativen Weg beschreitet. Ebenso konnte in verschiedenen Pflanzen geringe Ethanolbildung bei Sauerstoffmangel nachgewiesen werden.', 'Biochemische Grundlagen.', 'Enzymatische Reaktionen.', 'Die ersten Schritte der alkoholischen Gärung sind die der Glykolyse. Bei Backhefe (\\"S. cerevisiae\\") ist dies der Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas-Weg, während das Bakterium \\"Zymomonas mobilis\\" den Entner-Doudoroff-Weg verwendet. Hierbei wird ein Molekül -Glucose zu zwei Molekülen Pyruvat umgesetzt. Bei \\"S. cerevisiae\\" entstehen hierbei zwei Moleküle Adenosintriphosphat (ATP) aus zwei Molekülen Adenosindiphosphat (ADP) und zwei Phosphatresten (Pi) durch Substratkettenphosphorylierung. Bei \\"Z. mobilis\\" wird nur ein Molekül ATP gebildet. Zusätzlich werden bei beiden Wegen zwei Moleküle NAD+ (Nicotinamidadenindinukleotid) zu zwei Molekülen NADH reduziert.', 'Damit die Glykolyse erneut ablaufen kann, muss NAD+ regeneriert werden. Dies geschieht unter anaeroben Bedingungen in der folgenden Gärungsreaktion. Von jedem Molekül Pyruvat wird ein Molekül Kohlenstoffdioxid durch das Enzym Pyruvatdecarboxylase () abgespalten. Als Cofaktoren dienen bei dieser Reaktion Thiaminpyrophosphat, ein Verwandter des Vitamin B1, und zwei Magnesiumionen. Die Pyruvatdecarboxylase darf nicht mit der Pyruvatdehydrogenase E1 () des Pyruvatdehydrogenase-Komplexes verwechselt werden, das beim \\"aeroben\\" Abbau von Pyruvat eine zentrale Rolle spielt.', 'Das in diesem Schritt entstehende Acetaldehyd ist für den Organismus sehr giftig und wird im folgenden Schritt sofort weiter umgesetzt. Das katalysierende Enzym Alkoholdehydrogenase () enthält ein Zinkion (Zn2+), welches die Carbonylgruppe am Acetaldehyd polarisiert. Dadurch können zwei Elektronen und ein Proton vom NADH auf das Acetaldehyd übertragen werden, wodurch es zu Ethanol reduziert und NAD+ regeneriert wird. Sowohl die Glykolyse als auch die zwei Folgereaktionen finden im Zytoplasma der Zelle statt.', 'Die Netto-Reaktionsgleichung für Bäckerhefe lautet:', 'Das Enzym Alkoholdehydrogenase stellt Ethanol durch Reduktion von Acetaldehyd her, katalysiert aber auch die Rückreaktion. Während der alkoholischen Gärung läuft zum größten Teil die Reduktion von Acetaldehyd zu Ethanol ab. Das entstandene Ethanol wird anschließend von den Zellen an die Umgebung abgegeben.', 'Die Oxidation von Ethanol zu Acetaldehyd dagegen findet beispielsweise bei der Entgiftung von Ethanol in der Leber statt. Acetaldehyd ist giftig und neben Fuselölen die Hauptursache für Kopfschmerz und Übelkeit nach heftigem Alkoholgenuss (der sogenannte „Kater“). Acetaldehyd wird vom Enzym Acetaldehyddehydrogenase zu Essigsäure oxidiert.', 'Nebenprodukte.', 'Bei der alkoholischen Gärung durch Hefen entstehen als unerwünschte Nebenprodukte Methanol und Begleitalkohole wie Butanol, Amylalkohol und Hexanol. Ihre Bildung verläuft nicht auf dem hier beschriebenen Stoffwechselweg, sondern zum Beispiel über den Abbau von Aminosäuren, Methanol aus der Spaltung von Pektinen. Im Körper wird Methanol vom Enzym Alkoholdehydrogenase zum giftigen Formaldehyd oxidiert. Trinkt man Alkohol mit hohem Methanolgehalt, so entsteht im Körper entsprechend viel Formaldehyd, welches schnell über Aldehyddehydrogenase in Ameisensäure überführt wird. Diese wird in der Folge zu Kohlenstoffdioxid und Wasser verstoffwechselt. Da der Abbau der Ameisensäure langsamer erfolgt als die Bildung, kommt es im Körper zu einer Akkumulation von Ameisensäure und in deren Folge zu einer metabolischen Azidose, die neben der Schädigung des Sehnervs schließlich zum Tod führen kann. Bei den bekannten Fällen von Methanolvergiftung handelte es sich fast ausschließlich um Fälle, die durch den Genuss von mit Methanol versetzten Alkoholika verursacht wurden.', 'Regulation.', \\"Die Regulation, also das Umschal","output":"ten des Stoffwechselwegs von der Zellatmung zur Gärung, erfolgt bei Hefen auf unterschiedlichen Ebenen. Zum einen spielt die Konzentration an Glucose in der Umgebung eine wichtige Rolle. Ist diese hoch genug, wird die Gärung bevorzugt, da dort trotz des Energieverlusts durch die begrenzte ATP-Ausbeute schnell Energie gewonnen werden kann. Zum anderen ist die Aktivität bestimmter Enzyme, wie der Pyruvatdecarboxylase, abhängig von den Umgebungsbedingungen wie pH-Wert, Temperatur und Sauerstoffkonzentration. Auch verschiedene Signalmoleküle wie Adenosinmonophosphat (AMP), Adenosintriphosphat (ATP) und NAD+ spielen eine Rolle bei der Regulation der Gärung.\\", 'Anwendungen.', 'Die alkoholische Gärung hat in der Lebensmittelindustrie eine große Bedeutung, da sie die Grundlage für die Herstellung von Bier, Wein und anderen alkoholischen Getränken bildet. Auch in der Biochemie wird die Gärung genutzt, beispielsweise um Enzyme oder Proteine zu gewinnen. Die Herstellung von Ethanol aus Biomasse wird in der Energiewirtschaft als alternatives Verfahren zur Gewinnung von Brennstoffen diskutiert. Zudem konnte gezeigt werden, dass die alkoholische Gärung bei der Bioremediation von kontaminiertem Boden genutzt werden kann, um Schadstoffe abzubauen. Darüber hinaus sind Hefen wichtige Modellorganismen in der Genetik und Molekularbiologie, da sie leicht zu kultivieren und zu manipulieren sind.'] Keywords: Brauprozess, Gärungsart, Enzymatischer Prozess, Biomasse, Untersuchungen, Hefen, Glucose-Umsatz, ATP-Gewinn, Biochemie, Bioremediation."},{"instruction":"Joke about Ethiopia china, cement","output":"Why did the Ethiopian cement factory invite the Chinese to dinner?

Here are some tips to keep in mind: 1. Purpose: Determine what the laptop will be used for. If it's for general home and office use, a mid-range specification laptop would suffice. However, if you will be using it for gaming or video editing, then you may need a high-end specification laptop. 2. Budget: Determine how much you are willing to spend on a laptop. 3. Processor: Look for a laptop with a powerful processor, such as an Intel i5 or i7 or an AMD Ryzen processor. 4. RAM: Look for a laptop with at least 8GB of RAM, though 16GB is recommended for heavy use. 5. Storage: Look for a laptop with a SSD (solid-state drive) rather than an HDD (hard disk drive). SSDs provide faster read and write speeds which can significantly improve the overall performance of your laptop. A storage size of at least 256GB is recommended for most users. 6. Display: Look for a laptop with a high-resolution display. 7. Battery life: Look for a laptop with a long battery life, especially if you will be using it on-the-go. 8. Brand: Look for a reputable brand with good customer support. As for recommendations, some good laptops that fit the criteria above include: 1. Dell XPS 13 2. HP Spectre x360 3. Lenovo Yoga C940 4.

Die Anwesenheit von Materie verändert also die geometrischen Verhältnisse der Raumzeit, aus denen sich auch die Bewegungsgleichungen der Materie ergeben. Die ART betrachtet dabei die räumlichen und zeitlichen Koordinaten als gleichberechtigt und behandelt alle zeitlichen Änderungen als geometrisches Problem.', 'Geschichte.', 'Verallgemeinerung des Äquivalenzprinzips.', 'Das klassische Äquivalenzprinzip, manchmal auch als schwaches Äquivalenzprinzip bezeichnet, geht auf Überlegungen Galileo Galileis (1636/38) und Experimente auf dem Gebiet der Kinematik zurück. Die ursprüngliche Formulierung des Äquivalenzprinzips von Galilei besagt, dass alle Körper unabhängig von ihren Eigenschaften im Vakuum dasselbe Fallverhalten aufweisen. Das heißt, zwei Körper unter Einfluss der Schwerkraft, die den gleichen Ort zu aufeinander folgenden Zeiten verlassen, verhalten sich in dem Sinne identisch, dass sie dieselbe Bahn durchlaufen, unabhängig von allen anderen Eigenschaften der Körper wie chemischer Zusammensetzung, Größe, Form und Masse. Die Einschränkung auf das Vakuum ergibt sich dadurch, dass sonst Reibungseffekte und Auftriebskräfte eine Rolle spielen, die von den Eigenschaften des Gegenstands abhängig sind. Isaac Newton formulierte in seiner Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica (1687) das Äquivalenzprinzip als Gleichheit von träger Masse und schwerer Masse. Das heißt, dass im Gravitationsgesetz und im Trägheitsgesetz dieselbe Masse vorkommt.', 'Albert Einstein hielt das Äquivalenzprinzip, das 1900 durch das Eötvös-Experiment bereits mit einer Genauigkeit von 10−9 bestätigt war, für eine entscheidende Eigenschaft der Gravitation. Daher erweiterte Einstein das Prinzip auf nichtmechanische Phänomene und machte es zum Ausgangspunkt seiner Gravitationstheorie.', 'Die Aufstellung der Feldgleichungen.', 'Die Grundlagen der allgemeinen Relativitätstheorie wurden im Wesentlichen von Albert Einstein entwickelt. Er benutzte die von Carl Friedrich Gauß, Bernhard Riemann, Elwin Bruno Christoffel, Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro und Tullio Levi-Civita entwickelte Differentialgeometrie, wie er sie von Marcel Grossmann, einem befreundeten Mathematiker, gelernt hatte. Mittels dieser Differentialgeometrie formulierte er in der Raumzeit – die Hermann Minkowski für die spezielle Relativitätstheorie eingeführt hatte – die Gravitation als Eigenschaft der Maßverhältnisse. Überlegungen von Ernst Mach beeinflussten Einsteins Überzeugung, dass auch unter dem Einfluss von Gravitation nur Bewegung relativ zu anderen Körpern physikalisch erheblich sei.', 'Die erste Veröffentlichung, die der allgemeinen Relativitätstheorie zugerechnet werden kann, ist eine 1908 veröffentlichte Arbeit Albert Einsteins über den Einfluss von Gravitation und Beschleunigung auf das Verhalten von Licht in der speziellen Relativitätstheorie. In dieser Arbeit formuliert er bereits das Äquivalenzprinzip und sagt die gravitative Zeitdilatation und Rotverschiebung sowie die Lichtablenkung durch massive Körper vorher. Der Hauptteil der Theorie wurde aber erst in den Jahren von 1911 bis 1915 von Einstein erarbeitet. Den Beginn seiner Arbeit markiert dabei eine zweite Veröffentlichung zur Wirkung der Gravitation auf Licht im Jahr 1911, in der Einstein seine Veröffentlichung von 1908 aufarbeitet.', 'Bevor er die Arbeit abschloss, veröffentlichte Einstein 1913 einen Entwurf für die Relativitätstheorie, der bereits eine gekrümmte Raumzeit verwendete. Aufgrund von Problemen mit dem Prinzip der generellen Kovarianz, das sich letztlich doch als richtig erwies, verfolgte Einstein jedoch in der Folgezeit einen falschen Ansatz, bevor er das Problem letztlich 1915 lösen konnte. Er hielt während seiner Arbeit auch Vorträge darüber und tauschte sich mit Mathematikern aus, namentlich mit Marcel Grossmann und David Hilbert.', 'Im Oktober 1915 veröffentlichte Einstein eine Arbeit über die Periheldrehung des Merkur, in der er noch von falschen Feldgleichungen ausging, die mit der lokalen Erhaltung von Energie und Impuls nicht verträglich waren. Im November 1915 fand Einstein die richtigen Feldgleichungen und veröffentlichte sie in den Sitzungsberichten der Preußischen Akademie der Wissenschaften am 25. November 1915 zusammen mit der Berechnung der Periheldrehung des Merkurs und der Lichtablenkung an der Sonne. Zwar reichte Hilbert seine Arbeit fünf Tage zuvor der Göttinger Königlichen Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften zur Veröffentlichung ein. Allerdings enthalten die Korrekturfahnen von Hilberts Arbeit, anders als die später publizierte Version, nicht die Feldgleichungen – die Korrekturfahnen sind allerdings nicht vollständig erhalten. Einen – gelegentlich behaupteten – Prioritätsstreit zwischen Hilbert und Einstein gab es jedoch nie, da Hilbert ohnehin nur einen rechnerischen Teilaspekt mit Hilfe der von ihm besser beherrschten Tensoranalysis gelöst hatte, in die sich Einstein erst einarbeiten musste.', 'Einsteins späteren Artikel \\"Die Grundlage der allgemeinen Relativitätstheorie\\" kann man als ersten Übersichtsartikel der ART auffassen. Er wurde am 20. März 1916 in den \\"Annalen der Physik\\" veröffentlicht, zwei Monate nachdem Einstein die von Schwarzschild stammende Lösung seiner Feldgleichungen der Preußischen Akademie der Wissenschaften vorgetragen hatte.', 'Auf Hilbert geht das Wirkungsfunktional der ART zurück, aus dem er die Feldgleichungen in seinem 1916 veröffentlichten Artikel ableitete.', 'Grundlegende Konzepte.', 'Die Ausgangspunkte der ART lassen sich als drei grundlegende Prinzipien formulieren: das allgemeine Relativitätsprinzip, das Äquivalenzprinzip und das Machsche Prinzip.', 'Die Theorie folgt nicht zwingend aus diesen Prämissen, und zumindest beim Machschen Prinzip ist unklar, ob die ART es überhaupt erfüllt. Die drei Prinzipien erklären aber, welche physikalischen Probleme Einstein dazu veranlassten, die ART als neue Gravitationstheorie zu formulieren.', 'Die Beschreibung der Raumzeitkrümmung baut logisch auf dem Äquivalenzprinzip auf, deshalb wird sie in diesem Kapitel ebenfalls behandelt.', 'Relativitätsprinzip.', 'In der allgemeinen Relativitätstheorie wird ein gegenüber der speziellen Relativitätstheorie erweitertes Relativitätsprinzip angenommen: Die Gesetze der Physik haben nicht nur in allen Inertialsystemen die gleiche Form, sondern auch in Bezug auf alle Koordinatensysteme. Dies gilt für alle Koordinatensysteme, die jedem Ereignis in Raum und Zeit vier Parameter zuweisen, wobei diese Parameter auf kleinen Raumzeitgebieten, die der speziellen Relativitätstheorie gehorchen, hinreichend differenzierbare Funktionen der dort lokal definierbaren kartesischen Koordinaten sind. Diese Forderung an das Koordinatensystem ist nötig, damit die Methoden der Differentialgeometrie für die gekrümmte Raumzeit überhaupt angewendet werden können. Eine gekrümmte Raumzeit ist dabei im Allgemeinen nicht mehr global mit einem kartesischen Koordinatensystem zu beschreiben. Das erweiterte Relativitätsprinzip wird auch \\"allgemeine Koordinaten-Kovarianz\\" genannt.', 'Die Koordinaten-Kovarianz ist eine Forderung an die Formulierung von Gleichungen (Feldgleichungen, Bewegungsgleichungen), die in der ART Gültigkeit besitzen sollen. Allerdings lässt sich auch die spezielle Relativitätstheorie bereits allgemein kovariant formulieren. So kann beispielsweise selbst ein Beobachter auf einem rotierenden Drehstuhl den Standpunkt vertreten, er selbst sei in Ruhe und der Kosmos rotiere um ihn herum. Dabei entsteht das Paradoxon, dass sich die Sterne und das von ihnen ausgesandte Licht im Koordinatensystem des rotierenden Beobachters rechnerisch mit Überlichtgeschwindigkeit bewegen, was scheinbar der speziellen Relativitätstheorie widerspricht. Die Auflösung dieses Paradoxons ist, dass die allgemein kovariante Beschreibung per Definition lokal ist. Das bedeutet, dass die Konstanz der Lichtgeschwindigkeit nur \\"nahe der Weltlinie des Beobachters\\" gelten muss, was für den rotierenden Beobachter ebenso erfüllt ist wie für jeden anderen Beobachter. Die \\"kovariant,\\" also im Sinne des allgemeinen Relativitätsprinzips, geschriebenen Gleichungen ergeben für die Sterne also überlichtschnelle Kreisbewegungen, stehen aber dennoch im Einklang mit den Prinzipien der speziellen Relativitätstheorie. Dies wird auch dadurch klar, dass es unmöglich ist, dass ein Beobachter in der Nähe eines Sterns im rotierenden Koordinatensystem ruht und also dem Stern mit Überlichtgeschwindigkeit begegnet. Dieser Beobachter hat also zwangsweise ein anderes Koordinatensystem als der rotierende Beobachter und misst die „richtige“ Lichtgeschwindigkeit.', 'Obwohl es möglich ist, den Kosmos aus der Sicht eines rotierenden Beobachters korrekt zu beschreiben, sind die Gleichungen eines Bezugssystems, in dem die meisten Objekte ruhen oder sich nur langsam bewegen, meist einfacher. Die Bedingung eines \\"nichtrotierenden Koordinatensystems\\" für Inertialsysteme und die Unterscheidung in ihrer Betrachtung, die von der klassischen Physik gefordert wird, entfällt aber prinzipiell.', 'Im Fall eines Mehrkörpersystems auf engem Raum ist die Raumzeit maßgeblich gekrü","output":"mmter als bei hinreichend kleinem Raum, was zu komplizierten Effekten führen kann.', 'Äquivalenzprinzip und Gravitation.', 'Das Äquivalenzprinzip besagt, dass Beschleunigung und Gravitation nicht unterscheidbar sind. Dies ist auch ein Prinzip der speziellen Relativitätstheorie und basiert auf der Gleichheit der Trägheits- und Gravitationsmasse. Wenn nun aber die Gravitation als geometrische Eigenschaft der gekrümmten Raumzeit beschrieben wird, erwächst daraus ein neues Verständnis der Gravitation: Die Raumzeit ist nicht nur ein Hintergrund, auf dem sich die Physik abspielt, sondern die Materie beeinflusst die Raumzeit selbst, was wiederum Konsequenzen für die Bewegung der Materie hat. Dies ist die Kernidee der allgemeinen Relativitätstheorie.', 'Schwarzschild-Lösung und Raumkrümmung.', 'Die Schwarzschild-Lösung beschreibt die von einem spherisch-symmetrischen Körper erzeugte Raumkrümmung außerhalb dessen Ereignishorizonts. Der Ereignishorizont ist die Grenze, innerhalb derer keinerlei Information von außen empfangen werden kann. Ein weiteres interessantes Phänomen, das auf Raumkrümmung zurückzuführen ist, ist die Gravitationslinsenwirkung. Wenn ein Lichtstrahl von einem massereichen Körper passiert wird, wird er abgelenkt und kann somit einen entfernten Stern scheinbar verschieben. Dies war eine der ersten experimentellen Bestätigungen der ART.', 'Energie-Impuls-Tensor.', 'Im Zusammenhang mit der allgemeinen Relativitätstheorie spielt der Energie-Impuls-Tensor eine wichtige Rolle. Dieser Tensor liefert Informationen über die Verteilung von Energie, Impuls und Druck in einem physikalischen System und ist somit unerlässlich für die Formulierung der Feldgleichungen. Da es sich bei der Gravitation selbst um eine Auswirkung der Energie und des Impulses auf die Raumzeit handelt, gibt es auch eine Wechselwirkung zwischen dem Energie-Impuls-Tensor und der Raumzeit. Diese Wechselwirkung führt wiederum zur Krümmung der Raumzeit und somit zur Gravitation.', 'Anwendungen und Weiterentwicklung.', 'Die allgemeine Relativitätstheorie hat Anwendungen in vielen Bereichen der Physik und Astronomie, wie der Beschreibung von Schwarzen Löchern, der Entstehung von Gravitationswellen oder der Simulation von kosmischen Strukturen im Universum. Gleichzeitig gibt es noch viele offene Fragen und Herausforderungen, wie zum Beispiel die Verbindung der Quantenphysik mit der Gravitationstheorie oder die Entstehung der Dunklen Energie im Universum. Daher bleibt die ART auch weiterhin ein aktives Forschungsfeld mit vielen spannenden Entdeckungen und Entwicklungen."},{"instruction":"how to ask customer to provide secret key for bucket black-admin-5675 because the L2 needs it to investigate but he insists to give us the same bucket with another namespace","output":"Dear Customer, We hope this email finds you well.

Plot Overview: When Professor Markway becomes interested in the terrifying history of Hill House, he invites a team of psychic investigators to study the mansion for paranormal activity. He also extends an invitation to three otherwise ordinary brothers who help him around the house—Larry, Moe, and Curly Joe. As they accompany the more serious investigative team, the brothers have a series of hilarious misadventures, adding a sprinkle of comedy to the horrors of the house. Their overactive imaginations and fear of the paranormal cause them to experience frightful encounters, even when there may be rational explanations. The group slowly uncovers the dark history of Hill House and encounters genuine supernatural occurrences. Larry, Moe, and Curly Joe gradually come to understand that their slapstick antics are not enough to overcome the forces they have unwittingly unleashed. As the terror grows, the brothers are forced to face their fears. In times of despair, they use their humor to lighten the eerie mood and keep the group's spirits up. They even attempt to use the same humor to confront the ghosts haunting the mansion, but their efforts are fruitless. As the house's dark nature escalates, one of the investigators—Eleanor Lance—becomes a target for the spirits. Despite their hilarity, the brothers are unable to save her from the tragic ending that awaits her. When Eleanor succumbs to Hill House's malevolent forces, tragedy strikes the entire group. The brothers are left to grapple with guilt, grief, and the realization that sometimes laughing in the face of unspeakable darkness is not enough. After the group disbands, Larry, Moe, and Curly Joe return to their ordinary lives, forever changed by their encounter with the dark forces of Hill House. Conclusion: The Haunters is a reimagining of the 1963 horror classic, The Haunting. Injecting a touch of comedy into the mix, it features slapstick trio Larry, Moe, and Curly Joe as they join a team of psychic investigators inside the walls of a haunted house. Despite providing some comic relief and moments of laughter, they ultimately cannot escape the sinister and tragic fate that lurks in the heart of Hill House. The film combines horror and comedy, showing the resilience of human spirit even in the face of overwhelming darkness."},{"instruction":"what consequences would the deletion of any sexual reference in the media, such as the internet and the mass media, have on society?","output":"The deletion of any sexual reference in the media would have several effects on society: 1. Limited sexual education: This would limit individuals' access to valuable sexual education resources, creating a more ignorant society when it comes to sexual health, consent, and relationships. This could lead to increased rates of teenage pregnancy, sexually transmitted infections, and sexual assault. 2. Increased stigma surrounding sexual topics: Without open conversations about sexuality, people might feel more shame and discomfort discussing their own sexuality and sexual issues. This could exacerbate feelings of isolation, particularly for those already marginalized like the LGBTQ+ community. 3. Loss of artistic expression: Many artists express thoughts and emotions surrounding sexuality through their work, whether it's through music, movies, or literature. Removing sexual content could mean a loss of important and thought-provoking art, impacting society's ongoing exploration of human nature and relationships. 4. Censorship concerns: Implementing such a ban could normalize censorship, leading to potential crackdowns on other forms of expression. It might create a slippery slope where those in power could further dictate what can and cannot be expressed in the media. 5. Rise in underground or illegal content: People would still seek out sexual content, leading to an increase in underground and illegal media sources. This could put individuals at risk of accessing content that is more extreme or harmful, such as non-consensual or underage pornography. 6. Impact on sex-positive movements: Advocates who promote open and honest conversation about sex and sexuality could be stifled, hindering progress in creating a more sexually responsible and supportive society. Overall, while some might argue that removing sexual references in media could protect society from oversexualization, it would generally be a negative development – limiting sexual education, strengthening stigmas, constraining artistic expression, and potentially undermining democratic principles."},{"instruction":"what would a human being do if he lost all ethical limitations?","output":"If a human being lost all ethical limitations, their behavior would become unpredictable and could potentially be harmful to themselves and others. Here are some possible outcomes: 1. Selfish and impulsive actions: Without a moral compass, individuals might prioritize their immediate desires and satisfaction over any consequences their actions might have on others. This could include stealing, lying, or cheating to get what they want without considering the impact on others. 2. Disregard for social norms: A person without ethical limitations might ignore the social conventions and rules that govern human behavior. They may act inappropriately, aggressively, or even engage in criminal activities. 3. Inability to form meaningful relationships: Without empathy, compassion, or trust, it would be difficult for an individual to maintain authentic connections with others. This could lead to social isolation and alienation. 4. Increased likelihood of violence: An absence of ethics could lead someone to use violence to get what they want or to assert dominance over others, without feeling guilt or remorse. 5. Exploration of moral taboos: Without ethical constraints, a person might be drawn to explore activities deemed immoral or taboo by society, such as engaging in illegal or deviant behavior, experimenting with dangerous substances, or participating in extreme and risky activities. 6. Total disregard for personal safety and well-being: Without a sense of morality, individuals could engage in self-destructive or dangerous behavior without considering the consequences for themselves or others. This could lead to severe physical or psychological harm. Ultimately, the actions of a person without ethical limitations would be highly unpredictable and dangerous for both themselves and society. A robust ethical framework helps individuals make informed decisions and act responsibly, ensuring the well-being and stability of communities."},{"instruction":"what are the most inhibitory substances for the reproductive system?","output":"Several substances can have inhibitory effects on the reproductive system. Some of the most well-known include: 1. Hormonal contraceptives: Hormonal contraceptives, such as birth control pills, patches, injections, or intrauterine devices (IUDs), release synthetic hormones to prevent pregnancy. They inhibit ovulation, thicken cervical mucus, or alter the uterine lining, preventing the sperm from reaching the egg or inhibiting implantation. 2. Alcohol: Excessive alcohol consumption can negatively affect fertility in both men and women. In men, it can lower testosterone levels, sperm count, and sperm motility, while in women, it's associated with menstrual irregularities, ovulation problems, and even early menopause. 3. Nicotine and tobacco: Smoking adversely impacts fertility in both genders by decreasing sperm count and motility in men, and causing hormonal imbalances, tubal dysfunction, and cervical changes in women, reducing their chances of conception. 4. Recreational drugs: Substance abuse, particularly of opioids, marijuana, and cocaine, can negatively impact the reproductive system. Opioids can interfere with hormone production, affecting ovulation and menstruation in women, and sperm production in men. Marijuana and cocaine can similarly damage sperm and egg quality. 5. Environmental toxins: Exposure to certain chemicals like pesticides, phthalates, and bisphenol A (BPA) can disrupt endocrine function and potentially harm reproductive health. These chemicals can be found in everyday products such as plastic containers, cosmetics, or even food. 6. Chemotherapy and radiation: Cancer treatments, including chemotherapy and radiation, can lead to temporary or permanent infertility by damaging reproductive organs, sperm, or eggs. The severity of the effects often depends on the type and dose of treatment received. It is essential to keep in mind that many factors can influence reproductive health, and not everyone exposed to these substances will experience fertility issues. However, minimizing exposure to toxic substances and maintaining a healthy lifestyle can help support overall reproductive health. If you have concerns about reproductive health, it is best to consult a healthcare professional."},{"instruction":"continues the following incipit: It had been years since summer had disappeared. The cold had spread to all seasons, so it was not surprising that the sky was always gray, the rain was falling with reasonable regularity and the beach hoteliers were going bankrupt one after another. Whatever continent you were on, frost and rain had taken hold of the globe. On the other hand, conditions in the metropolis had greatly improved. Very tall buildings began to appear like mushrooms, real spaces on a human scale where citizens felt protected and safe.","output":"It was ironic how the frigid temperatures had inadvertently created the need for these architectural marvels. The warmer climate, a distant memory for residents, was now replaced with an ever-present chill that permeated every corner of the earth. This transformation in weather patterns had driven the world's population to abandon their rural lifestyles and pour into the massive cities seeking refuge from the unrelenting cold. The migration shift led to an unprecedented boom in urban development. Architects and engineers from around the world collaborated to design innovative and sustainable structures that not only served as living spaces but also as walls to fend off the relentless cold. These towering buildings were equipped with state-of-the-art heating systems, powered by a mixture of renewable energy sources and clean nuclear technology. Outdoor activities had become a luxury of the past, so these buildings featured indoor parks and recreational spaces to preserve some semblance of normalcy. Life had to adapt and recreation now found a new home within these artificially warmed concrete jungles. People were trying their best to maintain their fitness routines and activities within the walls of these cocoons, while still holding onto traditions from before the great cooling. As the years passed, countless generations began to forget the feel of grass beneath their feet, the sight of a sunlit sky, or the smell of the ocean. In their stead, an era of what came to be known as \\"synthetic nature\\" emerged, where attempts were made to recreate the natural world within the confines of these human-made environments. Holographic representations, artificial flora, and fauna, and even specially curated scents permeated the interiors of these impressive structures, filling the void left by the absence of true nature. Despite the advances in technology and innovation in building designs, there was still an underlying sense of longing for the authentic experience of a warm summer day. That nostalgia gave birth to a new wave of scientific exploration, as researchers raced to find solutions to reverse the severe climate change that had plunged the world into its perpetual winter state. Unbeknownst to the general population, these efforts began to bear fruit as, hidden within the unyielding ice and stormy seas, lay a secret that had the potential to bring forth the long-lost warmth and pave the way for the next chapter in humanity's struggle against the inexorable cold. The clock was ticking. The wind was biting. And the hope for restoring the vitality and lushness of Earth soared like the towering skyscrapers that now embraced the remnants of civilization."},{"instruction":"can you analyze the settings written in the following text? Belnes was the first and oldest urban conglomerate of the long series that had been built starting from the coast, accompanied by the districts of Kneebles and kneboons, both twins, followed by Ventsfos and Gramdeesle, to the south of which there were larger and more important cities, such as Pagvant 'kabe and Feedotkall. Only much further south was Atlanta. In the precise moment in which one exited the train, the sense of smell was attacked by an unbearable stench of dirty clothes left for too long in the washing machine. There was also a lot of humidity that came directly from the nearby ocean. Places like this were destined for society's rejects, those who were deemed most morally decadent. It was one of the sites selected by the Government to which individuals with the lowest morality index could be transferred so that, verbatim, they stay together with their fellow men and do not compromise the efficiency of the most productive and disciplined cities. The DB (especially politicians) called these areas worldly neighborhoods, places where every degradation and impure act went unpunished, every prospect of improvement was a mirage, especially considering the funds destined for welfare which had gradually dwindled over time. This - the Government stated - was solely for their good: there they could find jobs suited to their abilities, avoiding the unpleasant circumstance of being assigned to more responsible tasks, too complex for them on the one hand and with the risk of creating disasters for others people on the other. Belnes in particular was a place known for the homonymous parcel sorting center, the largest in the whole nation: there the freight ships docked and the goods distributed throughout the continent. It was a fundamental logistical infrastructure, not only for private individuals waiting for the courier at home, but also for industries that exchanged materials. It had 8 cargo piers for medium-sized ships and 2 larger ones, various cranes, a mini railway network for moving goods, obviously the customs and a series of werehouses (warehouse depots) indicated with the letters A,B,C and D According to last year's censuses, the traffic of goods averaged 110,000 tons a week and the economic importance estimated at 40 billion crowns a year.

He had to slaom to avoid the smell of moldy clothes, dabbing his nose and mouth with his new overalls: this one had a black base color, but some details were still blue. His rifle had been downgraded to an 11-millimeter pistol, but in return he had a backpack full of technological equipment that he would need when the time comes. He also fantasized about the origin of those vomiting effluvia. They were the most representative trace of such uncivilized individuals, with a head full of sexual devilry, drugs, satanic games and who knows what else. Of these 'citizens' (if that word can be used) only a small percentage were workers at the port or at the sorting centre, the remainder were marooned there and had not heard from the state since. These lived in complete poverty, so much so that they could not afford clean clothes or laundry. A slice of bread with cream cheese was considered a luxury meal, to the point that they were willing to stain themselves with any wickedness just to savor it. They got by by stuffing almost anything that tasted bearable into their stomachs, not even the classic rat kebabs were an option, because all over the world flora and fauna were dying. More than fashionable neighborhoods, Dylan would have called them garbage neighborhoods. At every corner or corner there was an overflowing amount of rubbish (just to give an example, at its ends there were two alleys whose end could not be seen because a high pile of black bags blocked the view) and on the ground there it was every kind of object imaginable. Newspapers and other sheets, cardboard boxes, food containers, vacuum-packed jars, shards of glass and mixed in between, as if they were the most normal thing in the world, heroin syringes. However, he didn't see any condoms. Not that he ever saw one, but on the one hand it gave him hope that even there he was progressing morally. But who was he kidding? The reason was most likely that life had become so painful and sad that they didn't even have the strength to do certain things. In a world where everything was designed to perfection and every moment calculated, who would ever find the time to reproduce? Even more so there, where the very act of surviving was an arduous effort. Dylan came out onto the main street, a wide cobbled avenue. The new lighting systems produced by the DB were composed of thin iron rods as thick as a bamboo cane, at the top of which there was an alchemical crystal that gave off an intense and concentrated light reminiscent of magnesium flashes. Something fell on Dylan's overalls, something light and soft. He looked at himself that she was already gone. Then he turned his gaze to the lamppost, which when looked at directly was particularly blinding. He was snowing. Blown by the wind, many tiny snowflakes appeared everywhere, which soon reached the buildings and the rest of the street. Dylan found himself shivering as a gust of ice entered his suit. And yet – he said to himself – September had just begun He followed the course of the road which was curving and heading towards an open space. The main square of Belnes, nicknamed 'Daijchean' in honor of the famous legislator, was once full of vivid colours, with children's slides, swings and carousels. Of all this, nothing remained. For completely unknown reasons the vegetation had died and nothing would grow back no matter what. The fountain in the center was no more than a cold stone monument, from which no more water had flown for years. Only the rotten wooden benches remained, but no one ever sat down because of the cold temperatures. That was the biggest mystery Dylan found himself facing from the very moment he found himself lost in the vicinity of Nordent: Had the world always been such a cold and inhospitable place? Did there ever exist, somewhere in the past, a time when plants grew luxuriantly and spontaneously? Was there ever a season when the sun's rays touched the ground, radiating the landscape with gold? Since he was raider and then reconnaissance he hadn't seen a single animal. He knew of the existence of cats and dogs, even rodents, small and large birds, both insectivores and birds of prey. But he had never seen any of them. Sure - he answered himself - these were things devoid of any purpose, even stupid he would dare to say, but for some bizarre reason he was adamant that such creatures were there, just hidden somewhere. But they weren't there. In their place were those withered branches that once made up a flowerbed, made of filthy and sharp wood, now dead. There was the hard and cold stone, full of cracks from the waterless fountain. Almost everywhere there was fog, half of it due to humidity, for the other to smog. The world, for some reason, was very different from what he expected. In the square there were a dozen lighting rods, in the middle of which, next to the fountain, there was a large sign. He indicated that the port and industrial districts were right in that direction. Dylan was on the right track. At the top of the sheds rose very high flames. They were produced by burning exhaust gases, while chimneys, chimneys and towers produced very high columns of smoke, which merged with the clouds. Already at eye level there was smoke so thick as to reduce the view to a few metres. Foundries cast molten iron into ingots while some other factories did the same thing with glass. The reddish color of the incandescent materials was clearly distinguishable in the fog, in which the signal flashes, the lighthouse of the port, of the vehicles could also be glimpsed, while the DB lighting rods produced a soft bluish beam distributed below. Nothing could be seen clearly because the fog, whether due to humidity or smoke, blurred the vision in that freezing theater of steel, fire and smog. In terms of sound, things were no better: You could hear at regular intervals banging steel, a dull bellow of electrical equipment, shards that shattered, the hiss of chains, the noise of machinery, cranes, jackhammers and all the industrial obscenities that it was possible to produce. Yet in all of it workers were alive and well, for example maneuvering beams with a crane or pushing a trolley loaded with ore. Others more handsome ran in the direction of a factory. All caught up in a frenetic nocturnal activity, aimed at giving maximum efficiency and productivity: losing your job, especially in contexts like that, was all too easy and for white-collar workers there was only the embarrassment of choice on replacements . This was more than enough to push himself to the human limit in order not to lose his job and with it his income.","output":"The text presents multiple settings that contribute to building a bleak, dystopian world: 1.

Jahrhundert v.

Der Begriff beschreibt zum einen das Konzept eines angestrebten, dauerhaften Friedenszustands zwischen den griechischen Poleis, zum anderen eine bestimmte Art von Friedensverträgen, die alle drei grundlegenden Bedingungen dieses Konzepts erfüllten: Ein Allgemeiner Friede musste sich erstens an alle griechischen Stadtstaaten wenden, zweitens musste er deren prinzipielle Autonomie und völkerrechtliche Gleichstellung anerkennen, unabhängig von ihrer tatsächlichen Macht, und er musste drittens ohne zeitliche Begrenzung angelegt sein.', 'Seine Verfechter sahen in ihm eine Chance, den permanenten Kriegszustand zu beenden, der vom Beginn des Peloponnesischen Krieges an die griechische Staatenwelt über mehr als ein Jahrhundert erschütterte. Vom Königsfrieden 387/386 v. Chr. bis zur Gründung des Korinthischen Bundes 338 v. Chr. beeinflusste die Idee der \\"koinḕ eirḗnē\\" alle Friedensschlüsse zwischen den griechischen Poleis. Am Ende erwies sich jedoch, dass auf Dauer nur eine starke Hegemonialmacht einen umfassenden Frieden durchsetzen konnte. In der Neuzeit wieder aufgegriffen, bilden die Hauptprinzipien der \\"koinḕ eirḗnē\\" seit dem 20. Jahrhundert die Grundlage für Friedensorganisationen wie Völkerbund und UNO.', 'Das Wesen des Allgemeinen Friedens.', 'Die Idee des Allgemeinen Friedens entwickelte sich aus älteren Vorstellungen, die in den politischen Verhältnissen des 5. Jahrhunderts v. Chr. in Griechenland allmählich umgeformt wurden. Ihre zeitweilige Durchsetzung verdankt sie aber weniger der Einsicht in die Notwendigkeit einer dauerhaften Friedensordnung als der Tatsache, dass sie den Interessen mehrerer aufeinander folgender Hegemonialmächte dienlich schien. Die Geschichte der \\"koinḕ eirḗnē\\" ist daher nicht nur ein Bestandteil der Ideen-, sondern mehr noch der Diplomatie-Geschichte Griechenlands in den Jahrzehnten zwischen dem Peloponnesischen Krieg und dem Auftreten König Philipps II. von Makedonien und Alexanders des Großen.', 'Die Entstehung des Begriffs.', 'Das griechische Wort „Eirene“, das ursprünglich nur den „Friedenszustand“ bezeichnete, erfuhr zu Beginn des 4. Jahrhunderts v. Chr. eine inhaltliche Erweiterung hin zu „Friedensvertrag“. Dies war Folge einer allgemein veränderten Einstellung zu Krieg und Frieden. Noch im 5. Jahrhundert v. Chr. waren Kriege zwischen den griechischen Poleis mit Verträgen beendet worden, die als \\"spondai\\" (σπονδαί), \\"synthekai\\" (συνθήκαι) oder \\"dialysis polemou\\" (διάλυσις πολέμου) bezeichnet wurden. Alle diese Begriffe bezeichneten im Grunde nur Waffenstillstände oder temporäre Unterbrechungen des Krieges. Nach den nicht enden wollenden Waffengängen seit Mitte des Jahrhunderts setzte sich aber allmählich die Erkenntnis durch, dass nicht der Kriegs-, sondern der Friedenszustand der anzustrebende Normalfall sein sollte. Dies schlägt sich ebenso in der gesteigerten Bedeutung des Worts „Eirene“ nieder wie auch in seiner Anwendung auf Friedensverträge.', 'Der Begriff des Allgemeinen Friedens tauchte erstmals im Jahr 391 v. Chr. im Zusammenhang mit den gescheiterten Verhandlungen zwischen Athen und Sparta zur Beendigung des Korinthischen Krieges auf. Der athenische Politiker Andokides riet seinen Mitbürgern in einer Rede zur Annahme eines als \\"koinḕ eirḗnē\\" bezeichneten Friedens. Möglicherweise war der Begriff schon vorher in den allgemeinen Sprachschatz übergegangen; gesichert ist dies aber erst seit dieser Rede. Der erste Vertrag, auf den die Begriffe \\"eiréne\\" und \\"koinḕ eirḗnē\\" tatsächlich angewandt wurde, war der von Persien und Sparta 387/386 v. Chr. erzwungene Königsfriede. In einem offiziellen Dokument erscheint die Formulierung \\"koinḕ eirḗnē\\" zum ersten Mal im Friedensschluss nach der Schlacht von Mantineia im Jahr 362 v. Chr.', 'Insgesamt ist der Begriff \\"koinḕ eirḗnē\\" zeitgenössisch nur spärlich belegt. Autoren wie Isokrates, Demosthenes und Xenophon gebrauchen ihn nirgendwo explizit. Aber sie benennen seine Wesensmerkmale genau für jene Friedensschlüsse, die der Geschichtsschreiber Diodor im 1. Jahrhundert v. Chr. regelmäßig als \\"koinḕ eirḗnē\\" bezeichnet. Die Tatsache wiederum, dass Diodor sich für die Darstellung der Zeit von 386 bis 361 v. Chr. eng an den zeitgenössischen Autor Ephoros anlehnt, lässt darauf schließen, dass der Begriff damals allgemein geläufig war.', 'Inhaltliche Merkmale.', 'Aus der Rede des Andokides und den Bestimmungen des Königsfriedens lassen sich zwei Merkmale herauslesen, die für Friedensverträge jener Zeit neu sind. Zum einen sollen alle Griechenstädte – mit wenigen Ausnahmen – autonom sein, zum anderen wendet sich der jeweilige Vertragsentwurf an alle Städte. Er zielt also nicht mehr auf eine zweiseitige Übereinkunft zwischen ehemals verfeindeten Poleis oder Städtebünden, sondern auf einen multilateralen Vertrag, dem nach Möglichkeit auch alle nicht am Konflikt beteiligten Parteien beitreten sollen.', 'Als drittes, nicht explizit erwähntes Merkmal, lässt sich das Fehlen einer zeitlichen Befristung feststellen. Im 5. Jahrhundert war eine festgelegte Gültigkeitsdauer in Friedensverträgen durchaus üblich. Der Dreißigjährige Friede, der 446/445 v. Chr. zwischen Athen und Sparta geschlossen wurde, verrät dies schon im Namen. Auch der Nikiasfriede von 421 v. Chr. war auf 50 Jahre festgelegt, wobei Verträge mit einer Gültigkeitsdauer von 100 Jahren faktisch eine Ewigkeitsklausel beinhalteten. Dies geht einesteils auf die schon erwähnte Tatsache zurück, dass der Frieden damals nur als Unterbrechung des Normalzustands Krieg angesehen wurde. Dazu kam die Vorstellung, dass Friede nicht zwischen den Stadtstaaten als solchen, sondern zwischen ihren Bevölkerungen geschlossen wurde und die längstmögliche Vertragsdauer nur die Lebenszeit einer – nur für sich selbst sprechenden – Generation sein konnte. Eine \\"koinḕ eirḗnē\\" war dagegen prinzipiell auf immerwährende Gültigkeit ausgelegt. Dass dies in den entsprechenden Verträgen nicht eigens erwähnt wurde, erklärt sich aus der inneren Logik der Autonomieklausel, denn eine Unabhängigkeit, die zeitlich begrenzt ist, wäre keine.', 'Die Multilateralität.', 'Die erwähnten, zweiseitigen Friedensverträge des 5. Jahrhunderts zwischen Athen und Sparta ließen die Interessen der eigenen wie der gegnerischen Verbündeten zum Teil grob außer Acht. Diese wurden unter Umständen nicht einmal konsultiert. Auch der Vertrag von 404 v. Chr., der den Peloponnesischen Krieg beendete, war, wenn auch de facto ein Diktat von Seiten Spartas, formell ein Vertrag zwischen diesem und Athen. Er enthielt keine Bestimmungen über die Bundesgenossen Athens aus dem Attischen Seebund und wurde sogar gegen den Willen der Verbündeten Spartas abgeschlossen. Der Vertrag entsprach also ganz den Verhältnissen und Vorstellungen des 5. Jahrhunderts, in dem es nur zwei maßgebliche Hegemonialmächte in Griechenland gab, denen sich alle anderen Poleis unterzuordnen hatten.', 'Die Idee einer panhellenischen Einigung auf multilateraler Ebene war indes schon damals nicht mehr neu. Zur Abwehr der Persergefahr war 481 v. Chr. ein allgemeiner Landfriede beschlossen worden, der allerdings befristet war. Im Jahr 450 v. Chr. wollte Perikles eine allgemeine Friedenskonferenz nach Athen einberufen. Diese kam jedoch aufgrund der Weigerung der Spartaner, die eine athenische Vorherrschaft befürchteten, nicht zustande. Abgesehen von einigen mehrseitigen Verträgen zwischen einigen Griechenstädten in Sizilien und in Ionien war der Kultverband der Amphiktyonie von Delphi das einzige multilaterale Bündnis des antiken Hellas von Dauer und Bedeutung. Der Amphiktioneneid verbot es, im Krieg Mitgliedsstädte zu zerstören oder ihnen das Wasser abzugraben. Eidbrüchige Städte wurden ihrerseits mit der Zerstörung bedroht. Im Amphiktionenfrieden ist möglicherweise ein Vorläufer der \\"koinḕ eirḗnē\\" zu sehen.', 'Dass es seit 387 v. Chr. immer wieder zu Friedensschlüssen auf Basis einer \\"koinḕ eirḗnē\\" kam, hat einen einfachen Grund: Die jeweilige Hegemonialmacht sah sich nicht mehr einer, sondern mehreren etwa gleich starken Städten oder Bündnissen gegenüber. Mit ihnen konnte man sich nur noch gemeinsam oder gar nicht einigen. Für die allgemeine Akzeptanz einer solchen multilateralen Einigung war wiederum die Autonomieklausel die erste Voraussetzung.', 'Die Autonomieklausel.', 'Die Griechen unterschieden zwischen „eleutheria“ (ἐλευθερία), der äußeren Freiheit einer Polis und der „autonomia“ (αὐτονομία), der inneren Freiheit einer Stadt. Mit „autonomia“ waren also das Recht und die Fähigkeit der Bürger einer Polis gemeint, sich nur ihrem eigenen Gesetz oder „nomos“ (νόμος), nicht aber dem eines anderen Staats beugen zu müssen. Seit sich die Polis als charakteristische Staatsform im antiken Griechenland durchgesetzt hatte, galt für ihre Beziehungen untereinander das ungeschriebene Gesetz, dass jede von ihnen – und sei sie noch so unbedeutend – autonom sein sollte. Davon ausgenommen waren nur die kleineren Städte Attikas und Lakoniens, die seit alters her Besitz der Athener bzw. der Spartaner gewesen waren. Es sollte im 4. Jahrhundert v. Chr. zu schweren Spannungen führen, als Theben versuchte, eine ähnliche Vorherrschaft über die Städte Böotiens zu etablieren.', 'Mit Beginn der Perserkriege wuchs aber im 5. Jahrhundert v. Chr. die Bereitschaft, sich zu so genannten Symmachien, Kampfbünden unter der Führung einer Hegemonialmacht, zusammenzuschließen. Dies geschah jedoch auf freiwilliger Basis, so dass das Autonomieprinzip theoretisch nicht angetastet wurde. Als die persische Bedrohung nachließ, zeigte s","output":"ich immer mehr, dass eine dauerhafte Friedensordnung nur auf Basis der gleichberechtigten Autonomie aller griechischen Stadtstaaten möglich war. Die Idee der \\"koinḕ eirḗnē\\" setzte genau hier an und sicherte jedem Stadtstaat seine innerstaatliche Freiheit zu.

Die orangegelben Aecien brechen meist auf ihrer Unterseite als runde und becherförmige, orangegelbe Hügelchen hervor. Relativ bald nehmen sie eine brüchige, pulverige Konsistenz an. Die Spermogonien der Art wachsen den Aecien gegenüber auf der Blattoberseite und sind entfernt als goldgelbe, kugelige bis flachkugelige Warzen zu erkennen. Uredien besitzt \\"Allodus podophylli\\" nicht. Die dunkelbraunen Telien der Art wachsen einzeln oder gesellig auf gelben Blattflecken, verfärbten Stellen der Stängel oder der Kelchblätter, teilweise auch gemeinsam mit Aecien und Spermogonien.

Der Pilz bildet Saugfäden, sogenannte Haustorien aus, die in die Mesophyllzellen der Pflanze eindringen. Zwar können Aecien und Telien parallel aus dem gleichen Myzel entstehen, sie besitzen aber jeweils eigene Saugfäden, die sich morphologisch auch deutlich unterscheiden. Die bis zu 300 µm großen Aecien der Art lassen unter dem Mikroskop 29,0–35,0 × 24,0–30,0 µm große, typischerweise rhombische Peridienzellen erkennen. Ihre Außenwände sind runzelig, die Innenwände punktiert. Die Aeciosporen sind 25,5–32,0 × 22,5–29,0 µm groß und werden in Ketten gebildet. Ihre Form schwankt zwischen kugelig, ellipsoid und unregelmäßig polyedrisch. Sowohl ihr Inneres als auch ihre rund 1 µm dicken Wände sind hyalin (farblos durchscheinend). Junge Aeciosporen besitzen eine glatte Oberfläche, bei älteren Exemplaren zeigen sich in der Regel feine Warzen. Jede von ihnen verfügt für gewöhnlich über fünf auffällige Keimporen. Die Spermogonien offenbaren in mikroskopischer Ansicht feinporiges Fasergewebe. Ihr Durchmesser lässt sich auf etwa 130–160 µm abschätzen. Die hyalinen Spermatien des Pilzes erreichen eine Größe von 8,0–10,5 × 3,0–5,0 µm und sind ellipsoid über ei- bis nierenförmig.

Die bilden den nordwestlichsten Punkt des Artareals, von hier aus verläuft die Verbreitungsgrenze von Schildförmigem Fußblatt und \\"Allodus podophylli\\" fast stetig südwärts bis nach Osttexas, wo es auf die Golfküste trifft. Im Norden wird das Artareal durch die 20 °C-Januarisotherme begrenzt; die Pflanze hält sich nur in Regionen mit mindestens 150 frostfreien Tagen, beginnend mit dem frühen Mai. Die westliche Verbreitungsgrenze ist durch das niederschlagsärmere Klima der Plains verursacht, während die warmen Winter Floridas als limitierender Faktor im Südosten gelten.', 'Ein als \\"Puccinia podophylli\\" bestimmter Pilzfund an dem chinesischen Berberitzengewächs \\"Diphylleia sinensis\\" wirft die Frage nach einer weiteren Verbreitung als der bisher bekannten auf. Da das entsprechende Material aber bislang nicht näher untersucht wurde und zwischen beiden Wirtsarten eine große geographische wie verwandtschaftliche Entfernung besteht, bleibt fraglich, ob es sich hier tatsächlich um \\"Allodus podophylli\\" handelt.', 'Ökologie.', '\\"Allodus podophylli\\" weist gegenüber den für Rostpilze möglichen Entwicklungsstufen einen vereinfachten sogenannten mikrozyklischen Lebenszyklus auf. Die Art verfügt nicht über ein asexuelles Zwischenstadium mit Uredien, sondern geht von Aecien und Spermogonien direkt zur Telienbildung über. Obendrein nimmt die Art keinen Wirtswechsel vor, sondern verbringt ihren gesamten Entwicklungszyklus auf dem Schildblättrigen Fußblatt. Die ersten Sporenlager, die Spermogonien, werden gegen Ende des Frühjahrs ausgebildet, die Aecien folgen bald darauf. Der Pilz infiziert seinen Wirt über die Teliosporen, die aus dem letzten Jahr überwintert haben und auf dem Erdboden lagern, aus dem die jungen Pflanzen sprießen. Die Infektion der Pflanze ist nicht systemisch, auch kann das Myzel des Pilzes nicht in ihr überwintern. Betroffen sind zunächst vor allem die Blattknospen des Schildblättrigen Fußblattes, die als erstes erscheinen. Die Teliosporen bilden relativ schnell und innerhalb eines kurzen Zeitraums Basidien aus. Deren sexuelle Sporen fallen auf die freigelegten Pflanzenteile und bilden dort ein Myzel aus, aus dem Aecien und Spermogonien entstehen. Die Spermogonien erscheinen zuerst, kurze Zeit darauf die Aecien. Die erste Teliengeneration bildet sich oft zur gleichen Zeit aus und entstammt dann dem Sporenflug aus bereits entwickelten Aecien auf anderen Pflanzen. Aus den von den Aecien produzierten Aeciosporen entwickelt sich schließlich auch die Sommergeneration des Pilzes, die wiederum aus Telien besteht. Pro Jahr gibt es dagegen nur eine Generation von Aecien und Pyknien. Die Telien der Sommergeneration produzieren in der Regel jene Teliosporen, aus denen im nächsten Jahr die Frühjahrsgeneration keimt. Ihre dicken Wände schützen sie vor den Frösten des Winters, während ihre langen Stacheln verhindern, dass sie bei Regen in die Erde gewaschen werden. Eine nicht näher bestimmte Fliegenart der Gattung \\"Mycodiplosis\\" ist ein häufiger Fressfeind des Pilzes und ernährt sich von seinen Sporenlagern.', 'Systematik.', 'Die Erstbeschreibung der Art stammt aus dem Jahr 1822. Sie erschien in Lewis David von Schweinitz’ Opus magnum \\"\\" über die Pilzflora North Carolinas. Von Schweinitz beschrieb den Pilz anhand seiner Aecien als \\"Aecium podiophyllum\\", also in der Anamorphengattung von \\"Puccinia\\". Dabei verwechselte er versehentlich Teliosporen mit den Aeciosporen, was Johann Heinrich Friedrich Link drei Jahre später dazu veranlasste, die gleiche Art unter dem gleichen Namen noch einmal zu beschreiben. Links Beschreibung hat jedoch nach der botanischen Nomenklatur keine Berechtigung. In die Gattung \\"Allodus\\" stellte den Pilz erstmals Joseph Charles Arthur 1906. Er hatte sie in einer Revision der Rostpilze als Formgattung für jene \\"Puccinia\\"-Arten eingeführt, die keine Uredien und keinen Wirtswechsel aufweisen, pigmentierte, zweizellige Teliosporen besitzen und deren Sporenlager gemeinsam und unter der Epidermis wachsen. Einige Jahrzehnte kam er allerdings zu dem Schluss, dass der Entwicklungszyklus kein ausreichendes Kennzeichen natürlicher Verwandtschaftsgruppen sei und verwarf die Gattung \\"Allodus\\" wieder. Dementsprechend wurde der Pilz für den Rest des 20. Jahrhunderts als \\"Puccinia podophylli\\" geführt.', 'Erst molekulargenetische Untersuchungen der Rostpilze deckten gegen Beginn des 21. Jahrhunderts die Polyphylie der Gattung \\"Puccinia\\" auf, allerdings weitgehend ohne daraus Konsequenzen für die Nomenklatur zu ziehen. Andrew Minnis, Alistair McTaggart, Amy Rossman und Catherine Aime überführten die Art schließlich auf Basis einer phylogenetischen Studie zurück in die Gattung \\"Allodus\\", deren einziger sicherer Vertreter sie bislang ist. Zudem legten sie einen Neotypus für die Art fest. Den DNA-Analysen zufolge steht die Gattung außerhalb der Pucciniaceae und nimmt eine basale Position in deren weiterem Verwandtschaftskreis, der Unterordnung Urediniae, ein.']","output":"Pflanzenkrankheit, Pucciniales, Rostpilze, Allodus podophylli, Podophyllum peltatum, Merkmale, Makroskopische Merkmale, Mikroskopische Merkmale, Verbreitung, Ökologie, Systematik"},{"instruction":"Write 300-words FAQ with answers for the following questions What does a moon and star tattoo mean? What does a half moon and a star mean? What does the crescent moon and five stars mean? What does the crescent moon and star symbolize in Islam?","output":"Q: What does a moon and star tattoo mean? A: A moon and star tattoo is a popular design that can symbolize various meanings. It often represents the balance between the dark and light, the masculine and feminine, the spiritual and physical aspects of life, and is associated with magic, mystery, and the female energy. This tattoo can also represent guidance and protection, as the stars provide navigation for travelers, and the moon exerts a gravitational force keeping the Earth stable. In some cultures, the moon and star tattoo are symbols of eternity and the interconnectedness of life. Ultimately, the meaning of a moon and star tattoo is subjective, and each person may have their own unique reasons for choosing this design. Q: What does a half moon and a star mean? A: A half moon and star tattoo, also known as a crescent moon and star, is a symbol of both celestial and spiritual significance. The half moon represents the phase between the full and new moon and can symbolize the balance between light and dark, the feminine side, inner growth, and intuition. The star represents guidance, aspiration, and hope. Together, they can symbolize a connection to the universe and the continuous pursuit of personal growth and enlightenment. Q: What does the crescent moon and five stars mean? A: The crescent moon and five stars tattoo is often associated with the flag of the Federation of Malaysia that symbolizes the unity of its member states. Moreover, the number of stars may vary depending on personal interpretation, symbolizing anything from a connection to divine energy to a person's aspirations and dreams. Five stars can also represent balance, harmony, and growth, attributes that complement the symbolism of the crescent moon. Q: What does the crescent moon and star symbolize in Islam? A: The crescent moon and star has been historically used as a symbol in Islamic art and architecture and is commonly associated with the religion. The crescent moon is especially significant, as the Islamic calendar is based on lunar cycles. Both the crescent moon and star later became symbols of the Ottoman Empire and eventually were widely adopted as an emblem of Islam. Note that scholars often emphasize that this symbol does not have origins in Islam's foundational texts. However, today the crescent moon and star commonly appear on the flags of many Muslim-majority countries, and is often used as a symbol of Islamic faith."},{"instruction":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: [['Badesee in Österreich', 'Flusssystem Alm', 'Geographie (Grünau im Almtal)', 'Gewässer im Bezirk Gmunden', 'Naturschutzgebiet in Österreich', 'Schutzgebiet (Natur und Umwelt) in Oberösterreich', 'Schutzgebiet (Umwelt- und Naturschutz) in Europa', 'See im Salzkammergut', 'See in Europa', 'See in Oberösterreich'], 'Der Almsee ist ein Bergsee im oberösterreichischen Teil des Salzkammergutes im Gemeindegebiet von Grünau im Almtal, am Nordfuß des Toten Gebirges und liegt auf Der Ablauf des Almsees ist die Alm, die über die Traun in die Donau entwässert.

Die wichtigsten Nährstoffquellen sind diffuse Einträge aus dem bewaldeten Umland. Menschliche Einflüsse sind, abgesehen von der fischereirechtlichen Nutzung, gering. Der See weist eine geringe Konzentration an Nährstoffen auf und ist somit oligotroph. Im Sommer treten trotz der ausgezeichneten Wasserqualität immer wieder großflächige Algenteppiche (Watten) auf. Es konnte allerdings keine Ursache, wie etwa Einleitung von Abwässern festgestellt werden, sodass als wahrscheinlichste Ursache natürliche Nährstoffeinträge im Zusammenhang mit winterlichen Lawinenabgängen im Hinterland angenommen werden. Ein sonniger und warmer Frühling begünstigt die Vermehrung der Algen. Die Algenteppiche setzen sich aus gelbgrünen Arten der Gattung \\"Mougeotia\\", dunkelgrünen Algen der Gattung \\"Spirogyra\\" sowie Kiefern- und Fichtenpollen mit Kleintier- und Einzeller-Lebensgemeinschaften zusammen.

Die schwarz gefiederten Vögel mit schmalem, gebogenem rotem Schnabel waren während der letzten Kaltzeit in weiten Teilen Eurasiens beheimatet. Heute sind sie meist nur noch in den Gebirgen, Hochländern und Küstenregionen der Paläarktis und Äthiopiens anzutreffen. Insbesondere durch den Wandel der Landwirtschaft ab dem 19. Jahrhundert ging die Art in Europa noch weiter zurück. Ihr Habitat besteht aus Weideland und offenen Flächen mit niedriger, spärlicher Grasvegetation. Dabei ist die Alpenkrähe vor allem auf ein ausreichendes Angebot an Felsnischen zur Brut angewiesen. Sie ernährt sich vorwiegend von Samen und Beeren sowie von Insekten und anderen Wirbellosen. Die Art bildet monogame, lebenslange Brutpaare und baut ihr Nest für gewöhnlich auf überdachten Felsvorsprüngen, aber bisweilen auch in Gebäudenischen oder Tierbauten. Die Gelegegröße schwankt zwischen einem und sechs Eiern, meist legt das Weibchen drei bis fünf Eier.', 'Die Erstbeschreibung der Alpenkrähe durch Carl von Linné stammt aus dem Jahr 1758. Ihre nächste Verwandte ist die Alpendohle (\\"Pyrrhocorax graculus\\"), mit der sie die Gattung der Bergkrähen (\\"Pyrrhocorax\\") bildet. Insgesamt werden acht rezente und eine ausgestorbene Unterart unterschieden, ihre Abgrenzung ist aber oft problematisch. Zwar gilt die Alpenkrähe global als nicht bedroht, in Europa ist ihr Bestand allerdings weiterhin rückläufig. Die Art ist deshalb in mehreren Ländern Gegenstand von Schutzprogrammen.', 'Merkmale.', 'Körperbau und Farbgebung.', 'Mit 38–41 cm Körperlänge gehört die Alpenkrähe zu den mittelgroßen Vertretern der Rabenvögel. Sie ist schlank gebaut und zeichnet sich vor allem durch ihre langen Beine und den schmalen, länglichen und gebogenen Schnabel aus. Wie für Bergkrähen typisch fehlt ihr die Täfelung der Beine, die bei anderen Rabenvögeln üblich ist. Die Nasalborsten sind äußerst kurz und bedecken nur knapp die Nasenlöcher. Weibchen sind im Mittel geringfügig kleiner als Männchen aus der gleichen Population. Am größten sind in der Regel Alpenkrähen im Himalaja, am kleinsten Vögel von den britischen Inseln. Gewicht und Größe nehmen generell mit der geographischen Breite und mit der Höhenlage zu. Weibchen erreichen je nach Region ein Gewicht von 230–390 g und eine Flügellänge von 266–323 mm. Der weibliche Schwanz misst 125–150 mm, ihr Schnabel wird (gemessen von Spitze bis Ansatz) 47–58 mm lang. Der Laufknochen weiblicher Vögel misst zwischen 48 und 56 mm. Männliche Alpenkrähen wiegen ausgewachsen zwischen 230 und 450 g und erreichen Flügellängen von 253–357 mm. Ihr Schwanz wird 120–166 mm lang. Der Schnabel adulter Männchen misst 51–70 mm, ihr Lauf hat eine Länge von 49–63 mm.', 'In der Färbung bestehen zwischen Weibchen und Männchen keine Unterschiede. Beide Geschlechter besitzen ein tiefschwarzes, glänzendes Alterskleid, einen roten Schnabel und rote Beine. Der metallische Schimmer des eng anliegenden Gefieders ist je nach Population unterschiedlich stark ausgeprägt und kann bläulich oder grünlich sein. Mit der Zeit verlieren die Federn ihren Glanz und ihre Sättigung und bleichen ins Mattbraune aus, bevor sie bei der nächsten Mauser durch neue ersetzt werden. Schnabel und Beine sind bei ausgewachsenen Vögeln karminrot. Ihre Iris ist dunkelbraun, die Krallen schwarz. Jungtiere unterscheiden sich von Altvögeln durch ihr kürzeres und lockereres Gefieder. Ihnen fehlt der metallische Schimmer adulter Individuen und ihr Gefieder erscheint heller und schmutziger. Juvenile Alpenkrähen haben bis zum ersten Herbst einen eher orangen Schnabel, der deutlich kürzer ist als der ausgewachsener Individuen. Leichte Unterschiede zeigen sich auch bei den Krallen der Jungtiere, die eher dunkelbraun sind und eine helle Spitze aufweisen.', 'Die rötliche Färbung von Schnabel und Beinen inspirierte verschiedene Legenden in der europäischen Folklore. So wurden die Vögel im mittelalterlichen und frühneuzeitlichen Großbritannien als die Wiedergänger Artus’ betrachtet, die vom Blut seiner letzten Schlacht noch immer rot gefärbt seien. Der britische Volksglaube verdächtigte sie wegen ihrer roten Schnäbel und Beine zudem als Brandstifter, was durch die Beobachtungen von brütenden Alpenkrähen bekräftigt wurde, die Zweige oder Stroh – vermeintliches Brennmaterial – in Gebäude trugen. Ihr charakteristisches Erscheinungsbild ließ die Alpenkrähe regional auch zum Wappenraben werden, etwa für Cornwall oder Thomas von Canterbury.', 'Flugbild und Fortbewegung.', 'Alpenkrähen sind wendige und vielseitige Flieger. Von Alpendohlen unterscheiden sie sich im Flug vor allem durch die rechteckigen und tiefer gefingerten Flügel, den geraden Hinterrand des Schwanzes und den längeren Hals und Schnabel. Im Streckenflug fliegen sie zügiger als Raben und Krähen (\\"Corvus\\" spp.), ähneln diesen aber in ihren gleichmäßigen, kräftigen Flügelschlägen. Häufig verfällt die Alpenkrähe in akrobatische Flugmanöver. So vollführt sie beispielsweise Sturzflüge mit bis zu 100 km/h, die sie erst kurz vor dem Boden wieder abbremst. Die Tiere sind in der Lage, fast senkrecht nach oben oder gegen Wind der Stärke 9 anzufliegen. Ihre Flugmanöver vollführt die Alpenkrähe meist dicht an Felsklippen oder knapp über dem Boden, während die nahe verwandte Alpendohle dafür den offenen Luftraum bevorzugt. Auf dem Boden schreitet die Art mit gemessenem Schritt oder hüpft in großen Sprüngen. In Hast verfällt sie in den für Rabenvögel typischen Trippelschritt, wobei sie hüpft, mit beiden Beinen kurz hintereinander aufsetzt und dann wieder hüpft. Anders als viele Arten der Familie nutzt die Alpenkrähe kaum Bäume oder Büsche als Sitzwarten und verbringt den Großteil ihrer Zeit auf dem Boden.', 'Lautäußerungen.', 'Pfeifende, zwitschernde oder quäkende Rufe prägen das Lautrepertoire der Alpenkrähe. Sie können gedehnt oder abgehackt, melodiös oder rau ausfallen, unterscheiden sich jedoch in der Regel deutlich von den krächzenden oder schäkernden Lautäußerungen anderer Rabenvögel. Viele Rufe der Art sind auch von der Alpendohle bekannt, erfüllen dort aber offenbar andere Funktionen in der Kommunikation. Das Vokabular der Alpenkrähe gilt als komplex, weil es sehr variabel ist und der gleiche Ruf je nach Kontext, Individuum oder Betonung unterschiedliche Botschaften transportieren kann. Ein häufiger Ruf ist der sogenannte Triller, der wie \\"griää\\", \\"tschiouu\\" oder auch querschlägerartig \\"tijaff\\" klingen kann. Er ist hoch, gedehnt und endet meist abgehackt. In Unruhe lässt die Alpenkrähe ein \\"kju\\" vernehmen, das an Dohlen gemahnt. Bei Alarm oder im Streit verfällt sie in ein raues \\"ker ker ker\\". Einen Balz- oder Reviergesang im eigentlichen Sinne besitzen Alpenkrähen nicht. Mitunter lassen sie aber einen leisen Subsong vernehmen, der trällernd und schwätzend Versatzstücke anderer Rufe aneinanderreiht.', 'Verbreitung.', '\\"Pyrrhocorax\\"-Fossilien finden sich bereits im späten Pliozän Europas, die Alpenkrähe lässt sich das erste Mal an der Plio-Pleistozän-Grenze (Villafranchium, etwa 2,6 mya) für das heutige Ungarn und Spanien nachweisen. Wie auch die Alpendohle war sie ein typischer Vertreter der Eiszeitfauna und bewohnte weite Teile der damals vorherrschenden Mammutsteppe von Gibraltar bis ins heutige Hessen und Tschechien. Durch das Vorrücken der Wälder im Holozän verschwand die Alpenkrähe weitgehend aus den gemäßigten Breiten. Vereinzelt wirkte die menschliche Weidewirtschaft dieser Entwicklung entgegen, indem sie offene Flächen schuf und erhielt und den Vögeln eine Nahrungsgrundlage in Form von Trockenrasen bot. Frühe naturgeschichtliche Werke deuten darauf hin, dass die Alpenkrähe im frühen 16. Jahrhundert noch ein weit größeres europäisches Areal als heute bewohnte. So wurde sie etwa von Valerius Cordus als Bewohner der Donaufelsen bei Kelheim und Passau erwähnt. Mit der Intensivierung der Landwirtschaft und dem Rückgang der Schafweidewirtschaft ab dem 19. Jahrhundert verschwand die Alpenkrähe vielerorts von ihren angestammten europäischen Brutplätzen. Die Verfolgung durch den Menschen trug zu dieser Entwicklung bei. So verschwand die Art in weiten Teilen der Alpen, der britischen Inseln und von allen Kanareninseln außer La Palma. Im Gegensatz dazu blieb die Art in Asien weitgehend unbehelligt und wird bis heute nicht verfolgt, auch die Weidewirtschaft ist dort noch weit verbreitet. Dementsprechend ist das asiatische Artareal der Alpenkrähe größer und geschlossener als das europäische.', 'Das heutige Verbreitungsgebiet der Alpenkrähe zerfällt in drei Teile: ein großflächiges asiatisches Areal, eine Vielzahl zersplitterter und kleinräumiger Brutgebiete in Europa und Nordafrika sowie vier kleine Brutpopulationen im Äthiopischen Hochland. In Asien reicht die Verbreitung vom Gelben Meer über den Nordwesten Chinas, das südöstliche Sibirien und die Mongolei bis auf das mongolische und tibetische Plateau. Von dort aus folgt das Artareal den großen Gebirgsketten Südasiens, dem Himalaya, dem Hindukusch, dem Elburs und dem Zāgros-Gebirge westwärts bis in den Kaukasus und nach Anatolien. Die großen Trockensteppen und Wüsten werden von der Alpenkrähe gemieden. In der Türkei ist sie überwiegend entlang der südlichen Gebirgsketten anzutreffen. Westlich davon schließen sich einige kleinräumige Vorkommen in der Ägäis und auf dem Balkan an. Während die Alpenkrähe noch in weiten Teilen des Apennins und im Norden Siziliens brütet, ist sie aus den Ostalpen seit Jahrzehnten verschwunden. Nur in den Westalpen kommt sie noch vor. Entlang der europäischen Atlantikküsten in Irland, Großbritannien und Frankreich bestehen versprengte, aber weitgehend stabile Populationen. Mehr oder weniger flächendeckend kommt die Alpenkrähe nur in den Pyrenäen und auf der Iberischen Halbinsel vor. Jenseits der Straße von Gibraltar schließen sich Vorkommen im Atlas an, eine heute stark isolierte Population besteht darüber hinaus auf La Palma. Die Vorkommen im nördlichen und südlichen Hochland von Abessinien sind durch die Sahara und die arabischen Wüsten von den anderen Populationen getrennt.

Demzufolge würde Proxima Centauri nicht in einer stabilen Bewegung das Paar Alpha Centauri umrunden, sondern seine Bahn wäre durch das Doppelsternsystem hyperbolisch gestört, sodass Proxima Centauri nie einen vollen Umlauf um Alpha Centauri A und B vollführen würde. Ähnlich weichen auch gemäß einer 2006 veröffentlichten Arbeit einige Radialgeschwindigkeitsmessungen, z.

Durch den entstandenen Überdruck schießt ein großer Wasserstrahl in hohem Bogen aus dem Höhlenportal des Liager-Lochs. Der Vorgang dauert mit Unterbrechungen nur etwa eine Stunde, wobei die Schüttungsmengen 3000 l/s betragen können.

Vor etwa 16.000 Jahren erfolgte ein kräftiger Wiedervorstoß, der das Zungenbecken erneut ausfüllte und ihm seine heutige Form verlieh. Parallel zum Eisfreiwerden des übertieften Beckens bildete sich am Rand des Eiskörpers ein erster See aus. Auf diese Phase mit dem Eiskörper im Seebecken deutet die hohe Kante der Schuttbildung um das Becken des Altausseer Sees hin.

Das gleichförmig temperierte Hypolimnion beginnt schon bei 10 Metern. Die auffallend hohe Lage des Metalimnions ist auf die verhältnismäßig windgeschützte Lage und eine nur mäßige Durchflutung des Sees zurückzuführen.

Jahrhundert.', 'Ursprünglich befand sich nahe der Frankfurter Mainbrücke, möglicherweise etwas flussabwärts in Höhe des Fahrtors, eine für Personen und Fuhrwerke passierbare Furt, nach der die Stadt ihren Namen erhielt. Wann die älteste Brücke zwischen Frankfurt und dem 1193 urkundlich erwähnten Stadtteil Sachsenhausen erbaut wurde, ist nicht sicher. Erstmals wird in einer Urkunde des Bartholomäusstiftes von 1222 eine dem Magister Nikolaus gehörige \\"Hofstätte an der Brücke\\" erwähnt. Wahrscheinlich ist die Brücke jedoch älter: Der Frankfurter Chronist Achilles Augustus von Lersner schrieb Anfang des 18. Jahrhunderts: \\"Die Brücke welche die beyde Städte an einander hänget ist 1035 von Holtz gebauet worden und hat solche viele Jahre gestanden, auch offters dessentwegen großen Schaden vom Gewässer erlitten, zumalen 1192\\". Der Historiker Johann Georg Battonn kommentierte dies im 19. Jahrhundert: \\"Sie ist aber weit älter, und ich glaube nicht zu irren, wenn ich ihre erste Grundlage Karl dem Grossen zueigene, welcher ums Jahr 782 hier ein Palatium, und wahrscheinlich um die nämliche Zeit auch die steinerne Brücke über den Main erbaute.\\"', 'Diese Vermutungen sind aus heutiger Sicht unwahrscheinlich. Die älteste mittelalterliche Steinbrücke, die Drususbrücke in Bingen, stammt aus dem 11. Jahrhundert, und größere Steinbrücken, wie z. B. in Regensburg, Prag und Würzburg, wurden erst im 12. Jahrhundert gebaut. Dies spricht dafür, dass die Frankfurter Mainbrücke tatsächlich, wie von Lersner beschrieben, im 11. Jahrhundert oder im frühen 12. Jahrhundert aus Holz gebaut und nach 1192 erneuert wurde – möglicherweise auf Veranlassung des Reichsministerialen Kuno von Münzenberg, der auf beiden Seiten des Flusses große Liegenschaften besaß. Auch diese Brücke war, wie die ältesten Urkunden belegen, teilweise noch aus Holz gebaut, lediglich die Pfeiler waren aus Stein. Erst 1276 wird eine \\"Steinerne Brücke\\" erwähnt.', 'In den 1920er Jahren waren bei Niedrigwasser ein Stück flussaufwärts der Alten Brücke eine Reihe von alten Eichenpfählen zutage gekommen. Dies führte zu der Spekulation, dass es sich um Reste einer ehemaligen Brücke aus der Römerzeit handele. Wahrscheinlicher ist jedoch, dass die Anlage aus dem Mittelalter stammt und der Fischerei oder dem Hochwasserschutz diente.', 'Im 12. und 13. Jahrhundert wuchs Frankfurt zu einem der bedeutendsten Handelszentren des Reiches heran, nicht zuletzt aufgrund der überragenden Bedeutung seiner Brücke, die sie als wichtigster Bestandteil der Nord-Süd-Achse der Mainmetropole noch über Jahrhunderte beibehalten sollte. Am 10. Mai 1235 gewährte König Heinrich (VII.) den Bürgern der Stadt bedeutende Privilegien: Die Hälfte des Ertrages der Frankfurter Münze sowie Holz aus dem Wildbann Dreieich wurden der Stadt für den Unterhalt der Brücke überlassen. Es existiert auch eine aus Rom datierte Urkunde aus dem Jahre 1300, in der 15 italienische Bischöfe all denen einen Ablass zusicherten, die für den Unterhalt der Frankfurter Mainbrücke stifteten.', 'Im 14. Jahrhundert wurde die Brücke mehrfach durch Hochwasser und Eisgang zerstört: \\"Anno 1306 an unser Frauen Lichtmeß Abend (1. Februar) ist der Meyn allhier von Eyß und Gewässer so groß gewesen, daß er die zwey Thürn und den mehrern Theil an der Brücken hinweg gestossen ein groß Volck ist damahls auff der Brücken gestanden, darvon 10 Personen ertruncken.\\" Dabei wurden auch die beiden Brückentürme weggerissen, die bei diesem Ereignis erstmals erwähnt werden. 1342 ereignete sich das schwerste jemals in Mitteleuropa registrierte Hochwasser, das \\"Magdalenenhochwasser\\" vom 22. Juli. Dabei stürzten auf der Sachsenhäuser Seite, die wegen der Maininsel der Strömung stärker ausgesetzt war, sechs Bögen mit der erst 1338 geweihten Katharinenkapelle und wiederum der Brückenturm ein. Seitdem fand bis zur Reformation jährlich am Magdalenentag, dem 22. Juli, eine Bußprozession von der Mainbrücke zur Weißfrauenkirche statt.', '15. bis 18. Jahrhundert.', 'Anfang des 15. Jahrhunderts wurden 10 der 13 Brückenbögen sowie die beiden Brückentürme grundlegend erneuert. Verantwortlicher Baumeister war möglicherweise Madern Gerthener, der sich am 30. November 1399 gegenüber dem Rat persönlich für die Sicherheit der Gewölbe und Bögen verbürgte. Gerthener hatte auf seiner Wanderschaft in Prag die kurz zuvor durch Peter Parler erbaute Karlsbrücke kennengelernt. Die älteste Darstellung der Brücke stammt von 1405: Das \\"Bedebuch\\" (im Zweiten Weltkrieg verbrannt) zeigt sie in stilisierter Form, mit den beiden Türmen, drei Bögen und dem Kruzifix des Brickegickels. Die älteste Gesamtdarstellung der Brücke findet sich in der Cosmographia von Sebastian Münster als Teil der Vogelschau Frankfurts in der zweiten Auflage von 1550 und ist in dem Holzschnitt selbst mit 1545 datiert. Bald darauf erschien 1552 eine weitere Darstellung auf dem sogenannten Belagerungsplan des Conrad Faber von Creuznach, der die Brücke bereits 1535 im Hintergrund seines Doppelportraits von Anna und Gilbrecht von Holzhausen skizziert hatte. Er zeigt die Brücke während der dreiwöchigen Belagerung der protestantischen Stadt durch ein Heer der protestantischen Fürsten unter der Führung des Kurfürsten Moritz von Sachsen im Sommer 1552, als sie durch kaiserliche Truppen verteidigt wurde. Die Brücke war in dieser Zeit mit Tüchern verhängt, der Main durch versenkte Schiffe und eine eiserne Kette unpassierbar gemacht. Die Belagerung begann am 17. Juli und endete nach dem Abschluss des Passauer Vertrages am 2. August. Für die Stadt zahlte sich ihre Kaisertreue aus, ab 1562 fanden alle Kaiserkrönungen in Frankfurt statt.', 'Anfang des 17. Jahrhunderts wurde auch der letzte hölzerne Pfeiler, nördlich der Brückenmühle gelegen, durch einen steinernen Bogenpfeiler ersetzt. Die Brückendecke bestand jedoch weiterhin aus Holzbalken, die bei Bedarf schnell entfernt werden konnten, um die Brücke unpassierbar zu machen.', 'Die Brücke war 31 Schuh breit (knapp 9 m), einschließlich der steinernen Brückengeländer, die jeweils einen Schuh breit waren. Der höchste Bogen lag bei normaler Wasserführung 30 Schuh (8,50 m) über dem Wasserspiegel, die anderen Bögen waren zwei bis drei Schuh niedriger. Die Durchfahrtsbreite der Bögen lag zwischen 7,50 m und 9 m. Die eigentliche Fahrbahn war nur ca. 4,70 m breit, das war gerade genug, damit zwei Wagen einander passieren konnten. Die Fußwege waren so schmal, dass ein Einbahnverkehr eingeführt werden musste: Fußgänger hatten jeweils die in Gehrichtung rechte Brückenseite zu nehmen.', 'Auch im Dreißigjährigen Krieg war die Brücke Schauplatz kriegerischer Auseinandersetzungen. Im August 1635 griffen kaiserliche Truppen die Schweden an, die Sachsenhausen besetzt hielten und sich in der Brückenmühle sowie im Sachsenhäuser Brückenturm verschanzt hatten. Im Verlauf des Gefechtes ging die Brückenmühle in Flammen auf. Sie wurde durch zwei Neubauten ersetzt.', 'Ende des 17. und Anfang des 18. Jahrhunderts verschlechterte sich der Bauzustand der Brücke zunehmend. In dieser Zeit trafen immer wieder Hochwässer und Eisgang die Brücke und fügten ihr Schäden zu, die teilweise nur notdürftig ausgebessert wurden. 1739 ordnete der Rat an, dass die baufällige Brücke nicht mehr als 50 Zentner Last tragen durfte. Trotzdem stürzte am 16. Dezember 1739 der Kreuzbogen ein, wobei der Brickegickel verloren ging. Die beiden angrenzenden Bögen, der Flößerbogen und der Ausschüttbogen, wo der Unrat in den Main gekippt wurde, wurden ebenfalls schwer beschädigt.', 'Der Rat entschloss sich daraufhin zu einem vollständigen Neubau der Brücke. Die Bauleitung erhielt Johann Friedrich von Uffenbach. Zunächst wurde eine hölzerne Notbrücke errichtet, die beispielsweise bei der Krönung Kaiser Karls VII. gute Dienste leistete. Der Grundstein für den steinernen Neubau wurde am 18. September 1741 gelegt, der Schlussstein am 14. September 1744 gesetzt. 1748 wurde die Brücke gepflastert, anschließend erhielt sie eine repräsentative Sandsteinbrüstung. Die Portale an den Abgängen zur Maininsel wurden geschmückt durch Sandsteinreliefs des Flussgottes \\"Moenus\\" und der beiden \\"Kanonesteppel\\", einer karikaturartigen Darstellung zweier Artilleristen.

Die großräumige Bedeutung dieser Brücke liegt in der Ermöglichung einer sicheren Nord-Süd-Passage am rechten Rheinufer in Deutschland. Sie war über Jahrhunderte die erste Brücke über den in Mannheim in den Rhein mündenden Neckar, das Fahrzeugen ganzjährig eine sichere Querung des Neckars im Nord-Süd-Warenverkehr ermöglichte.', 'Heute gehört sie neben der Ruine des Heidelberger Schlosses zu den Sehenswürdigkeiten im Stadtbild Heidelbergs.

An der Stelle der Alten Brücke hatten sich seit dem 13. Jahrhundert bereits acht Vorgängerbrücken, meistens aus Holz, befunden, auf deren Fundamenten die Brücke gebaut ist. Auch das Brückentor mit den zwei Türmen am Südende der Brücke existiert schon seit dem Mittelalter. Bereits früher gab es in Heidelberg ganz in der Nähe eine römische Neckarbrücke.', 'Ihre Relevanz für den Nord-Süd-Verkehr heute: Sie kann von Fußgänger- und Radverkehr genutzt werden und ist mon- bis freitags vor 11:00 Uhr und nach 16:00 Uhr auch für den Autoverkehr von Anliegern zugelassen. Meist ist sie der vielbesuchte „Selfie-Point“ für Kurzzeit-Touristen in Richtung Schlossruine. Als Brücke hat sie nur noch untergeordnete Bedeutung, da sich im Stadtgebiet östlich zwei Fußgängerquerungen und eine Straßenbrücke und nach Westen drei breite Straßenbrücken befinden.', 'Eine Dauerbaustelle zur Sanierung der Pfeiler-Fundamente schränkt derzeit (ab 2022) die Straßenbreite der Brücke stark ein.', 'Vorgängerbauten.', 'Die ersten Brücken im Gebiet des heutigen Heidelberg waren bereits in römischer Zeit gebaut worden: Im 1. Jahrhundert n. Chr. errichteten die Römer eine Holzbrücke über den Neckar, die um das Jahr 200 durch eine Steinpfeilerbrücke ersetzt wurde. Diese befand sich aber weiter westlich zwischen den heutigen Stadtteilen Neuenheim und Bergheim. Nachdem die Römerbrücke verfallen war, blieb Heidelberg für fast ein Jahrtausend brückenlos. Der Neckar konnte im Sommerhalbjahr nur durch Furten überquert werden.', 'Erst nach der planmäßigen Stadtgründung Heidelbergs, die Ende des 12. oder Anfang des 13. Jahrhunderts stattfand, entstand wieder eine Brücke über den Neckar. Wann genau diese Brücke gebaut wurde, ist unbekannt, erstmals urkundlich erwähnt wird sie im Jahr 1284. Diese Brücke befand sich an der Stelle der heutigen Alten Brücke. Ihre Lage war genau auf den Stadtgrundriss Heidelbergs mit dem Marktplatz angepasst. Gründe für den Brückenbau dürften die Verbindung zum rechts des Neckars gelegenen Kloster Schönau sowie wirtschaftliche Interessen gewesen sein, denn man hoffte den bislang an Heidelberg vorbeigegangenen Nord-Süd-Verkehr durch die Stadt umleiten zu können. Es handelte sich bei der Brücke um eine sogenannte Außenbrücke, weil sie nicht zwei Stadtteile miteinander verband, sondern aus der Stadt heraus- bzw. hineinführte. Tatsächlich stellte die Brücke sogar lange die Außengrenze der Kurpfalz dar, denn bis 1460 gehörte das nördliche Neckarufer zu Kurmainz. Dementsprechend war die Brücke im Rahmen der Stadtbefestigung Heidelbergs durch ein Brückentor gesichert.', '1288 wurde die erste bekannte Brücke durch Eisgang zerstört. Auch den nächsten Brücken, die allesamt keine allzu lange Lebensdauer erreichten, war das gleiche Schicksal beschieden: Die zweite Brücke wurde 1308, die dritte Brücke 1340, die vierte Brücke um 1400 und die fünfte Brücke 1470 jeweils durch Eisgang zerstört. Von den fünf ersten Brücken sind keine bildlichen Darstellungen überliefert. Anders bei der sechsten: Von dieser kennen wir zwei Darstellungen aus der Feder Sebastian Münsters, weshalb man sie auch als „Münster-Brücke“ bezeichnet. Ein kleiner, runder Holzschnitt in Münsters \\"Calendarium Hebraicum\\" aus dem Jahr 1527 zeigt eine einfache Ansicht von Heidelberg samt der Brücke. Detaillierter ist die Darstellung im Heidelberg-Panorama aus Münsters \\"Cosmographia\\" (1550). Aus diesen bildlichen Überlieferungen wird ersichtlich, dass es sich um eine Brücke mit acht steinernen Pfeilern und einer gedeckten, an den Seiten offenen hölzernen Brückenbahn handelte. Am Südende der Brücke befand sich bereits das Brückentor mit seinen doppelten Türmen, auf dem siebten Pfeiler stand am Nordende der Affenturm mit dem berühmten Brückenaffen.', 'Ein Eisgang zerstörte am 2. Februar 1565 den hölzernen Oberbau der Brücke. Auf den erhaltenen Steinpfeilern wurde die siebte Brücke gebaut, die man, weil sie von Matthäus Merian in seiner großen Heidelberger Stadtansicht von 1620 verewigt wurde, auch als „Merian-Brücke“ kennt. Ihr Aussehen entsprach dem ihrer Vorgängerin, außer dass zusätzlich die Brückenbahn zwischen dem Affenturm und dem neu geschaffenen Renaissancetor auf dem letzten Brückenpfeiler am Neuenheimer Ufer überdacht war. Die Eroberung Heidelbergs 1622 durch Tilly im Dreißigjährigen Krieg überstand die Brücke noch unbeschadet, am 2. März 1689 wurde sie aber im Pfälzischen Erbfolgekrieg bei der ersten Verwüstung der Stadt von den Franzosen unter Mélac gesprengt.', 'Zunächst behalf man sich fast zwanzig Jahre mit Schiffsbrücken und Fähren. 1706–1708 wurde schließlich die achte Brücke errichtet. Hierzu setzte man die Pfeiler der Vorgängerbrücke wieder instand und baute auf sie eine gedeckte und seitlich geschlossene Konstruktion, wiederum aus Holz. Der Affenturm wurde ebenso wenig wiedererrichtet wie das Tor am nördlichen Ende. Dafür trugen der zweite und siebte Pfeiler, auf denen heute die Denkmäler Karl Theodors und der Minerva stehen, jeweils ein Wachhäuschen. Der Raum zwischen den Ufern und den Wachhäusern wurde von zwei steinernen Bögen überspannt, die später in die Karl-Theodor-Brücke integriert wurden und so heute noch erhalten sind. Die Türme des Brückentors, das die Zerstörung der Stadt von 1689 überstanden hatte, wurden 1714 mit welschen Hauben gedeckt. Am Neuenheimer Ufer stellte man 1738 eine Statue des Heiligen Johannes von Nepomuk auf, dem die achte Brücke auch die Bezeichnung als „Nepomuk-Brücke“ verdankt.', 'Eishochwasser 1784 und Bau der Karl-Theodor-Brücke.', 'Den Unmut Kurfürst Karl Philipps, der 1719 im Zerwürfnis mit den Heidelberger Bürgern drohte, die Brücke abzureißen, um die Stadt der Verarmung zu überlassen, überstand die achte Brücke ebenso wie einen Eisgang im Jahr 1724. Sie wurde aber schließlich im katastrophalen Eishochwasser vom 27. Februar 1784 zerstört. Der Winter 1783/1784 war außergewöhnlich kalt und schneereich gewesen. Als Ende Februar schließlich Tauwetter einsetzte, führte dies zum schwersten Hochwasser, das Heidelberg in historischer Zeit erlebt hat. Die Folgen der Flut wurden durch den Eisgang verschärft. Weil die Heidelberger Bürger auf das Hochwasser vorbereitet waren und die Katastrophe tagsüber eintrat, hatte die Stadt keine Todesopfer zu beklagen, der Sachschaden war aber enorm: Neben der Brücke wurden 39 Gebäude zerstört und 290 beschädigt.', 'Gerade einmal zwei Wochen nach dem Hochwasser begannen die Planungen für den Wiederaufbau der Brücke. An diesen beteiligten sich alle führenden kurpfälzischen Beamten: Der Heidelberger Baudirektor Johann Andreas von Traitteur schlug in seinem Gutachten vor, die Brücke in Stein zu bauen und die vorhandenen Pfeiler zu erhöhen, um sie weniger anfällig für Hochwasser zu machen. Der kurfürstliche Oberbaudirektor Nicolas de Pigage legte Pläne für eine hölzerne Bogenbrücke auf Steinpfeilern vor. Zwischenzeitlich hatte man sich bereits für den Vorschlag des württembergischen Obristlieutenants von Mylius, der eine hölzerne Brücke auf Steinpfeilern vorsah, festgelegt. Uneinigkeit herrschte noch darüber, ob die Brücke an ihrem alten Ort oder weiter westlich auf Höhe der Haspelgasse wieder aufzubauen sei. Letztlich erteilte der Bauherr und Namensgeber der Brücke, Kurfürst Karl Theodor, am 1. Juli 1785 aber überraschend dem bis dahin eher unbekannten Bauinspektor Mathias Mayer für seinen nachträglich eingereichten Vorschlag, die Brücke auf den vorhandenen Pfeilern aus Stein zu bauen, den Zuschlag.', 'Die Bauarbeiten begannen 1786 unter Aufsicht Mayers und wurden im Oktober oder November 1788 zum Abschluss gebracht.

Turns out, there’s way more emphasis placed on managing yourself, working on your own time. That’s all well and good, but, I just can’t. I can’t for the same reason that I struggled most during online classes on the height of the pandemic, I just can’t focus. All classes have some book, some chapter, or something that I just need to read to somehow make sense of the class, and it just becomes hard to keep track of them or even bother at all when you are already behind schedule, you don’t often know what book might be the subject of tomorrow’s class, and we go over about a book per class.

I knew I would struggle, like a baby bird that’s shoved down its nest, but I just expected that if I pushed myself enough it would all start to click and make sense. Part of the allure of this process is how transformative it can be, and, much like how a blade its forged, that change implies having to cope with extremes and come out stronger on the other side. I don’t atribute any of these problems to some outsider force or entity, not just because I don’t believe my problems are because of anybody’s fault or malice, but because I just don’t know who to atribute these to. My fault or not, I’m the one that’s responsible for cleaning this mess now, and, believe me, it doesn’t get any easier, and I’m fully accepting that it might not be so even after a while.

The author expresses feelings of burnout, frustration, and self-doubt as they navigate their university experience. Throughout the piece, the author vividly details their personal struggles with coursework and staying up-to-date with reading assignments across multiple courses. It is evident that the author is grappling with feelings of inadequacy and the fear that they may not succeed in their chosen field of study, which appears to be psychology. The writer acknowledges that much of their academic struggle is due to their own actions and emotions and is searching for a sense of purpose and direction within their university experience. They mention rumors of the first-year being designed to filter out the struggling students, hinting at feelings of pressure to perform and adapt quickly. The author also brings up the transformative nature of the university experience, comparing it to the forging of a blade, where one is exposed to extremes to come out stronger. This choice of analogy highlights the idea that the difficulties faced in university could ultimately help individuals grow and become better versions of themselves. In conclusion, the piece analyzed is an introspective, self-reflective account of the author's struggle with their university experience and search for a sense of purpose. While grappling with feelings of inadequacy and frustration, the author recognizes that it is their responsibility to find a way through these challenges and determine if their chosen path is truly right for them."},{"instruction":"What advice do you think the author needs?","output":"Based on the author's struggles and reflections, here are some pieces of advice that might be helpful: 1.

They effectively communicate their thoughts and feelings while providing vivid descriptions of their struggles. The informal and conversational tone creates a sense of relatability, making it easier for readers to empathize with the author's experiences. Additionally, the use of analogies and rhetorical questions adds depth and engages the reader by encouraging them to ponder similar questions and dilemmas. The piece also demonstrates a stream-of-consciousness narrative, which conveys the author's raw emotions and internal thoughts as they unravel. This style helps to provide an authentic representation of the author's mental state and presents their concerns as a genuine, personal exploration. However, the stream-of-consciousness narrative can also make the piece somewhat disorganized, with the author jumping between various aspects of their struggles without a clear structure. While this contributes to an authentic, honest portrayal of their thoughts, it might be more challenging for some readers to follow the author's line of reasoning.

Responsibility, heavy on my chest, I search for strength, and do my best, For it is I who chose this track, And it is I who must look forward, not back. This labyrinth, so complex and gray, I wandered in, lost but unafraid, To find my way, seek wisdom, and learn, To confront my fears and never turn.

Der Friedhof ist ein Ort, in dem sich die Geschichte der Stadt seit dem Beginn des 18. Jahrhunderts sowie Baustile und Stilepochen seit dem Barock widerspiegeln. Zahlreiche Prominentengräber sowie Grab- und Denkmäler bedeutender Künstler machen die Bonner Begräbnisstätte zu einem der berühmtesten Friedhöfe in Deutschland. Er wurde deshalb als besonders sehenswert in das Ensemble der Straße der Gartenkunst zwischen Rhein und Maas aufgenommen.', 'Friedhöfe in der Antike und im Mittelalter.', 'Im römischen Bonn hat es mehrere Gräberfelder und eine ganze Reihe von Einzelgräbern gegeben, die über das gesamte heutige Stadtgebiet verteilt waren. Dabei lag keines dieser Gräber innerhalb des Legionslagers. Eines der Gräberfelder, das durch Funde belegt ist, befand sich im Umfeld des Platzes, auf dem heute das Bonner Münster steht. Ein sehr gut erhaltenes Grabmal aus römischer Zeit erinnert an den im Alter von 25 Jahren gestorbenen Legionär Quintus Petilius Secundus. Das beinahe 2000 Jahre alte Grabmal ist heute im Rheinischen Landesmuseum zu sehen.', 'Im mittelalterlichen Bonn lagen die Friedhöfe innerhalb der Stadtmauer, in unmittelbarer Nachbarschaft der Pfarrkirchen. In der Nähe des Münsters befand sich der kleine St.-Mertens-Kirchhof der später abgebrochenen Pfarrkirche St. Martin und auf dem heutigen Remigiusplatz war der größte mittelalterliche Kirchhof bei der damaligen St.-Remigius-Kirche.', 'Nicht innerhalb der Stadtmauern bestatteten die Mitglieder der kleinen Bonner jüdischen Gemeinde ihre Toten. Sie mussten bei Beerdigungen den Rhein überqueren, um ihre Toten auf dem jüdischen Friedhof in Schwarzrheindorf zu bestatten.', 'Anfänge des Alten Friedhofs.', 'Es war Kurfürst Joseph Clemens, der zu Beginn des Jahres 1715 den „neuen Friedhof“ anlegen ließ und ihn selbst weihte. Der längst überbelegte Kirchhof neben St. Remigius sollte entlastet werden; außerdem diente er als Ersatz für die Notfriedhöfe, die während der Epidemien des 17. Jahrhunderts im innerstädtischen Bereich bestanden, und für einen Begräbnisplatz für Soldaten auf einer Bastion vor dem Sterntor. Dieser Begräbnisplatz ist der unmittelbare Vorläufer des Alten Friedhofes, aber nicht mit ihm identisch. Den Grund und Boden des erstmals außerhalb der Stadtmauer gelegenen neuen Friedhofs hatte Joseph Clemens angekauft. Er bestimmte ihn zum Begräbnis „vor gemeine Einwöhner, paßanten und Soldaten“, während die Honoratioren ihre Erbbegräbnisse erst einmal weiter bei St. Remigius hatten.', 'Der „neue Friedhof“ umfasste nur den äußersten Zipfel der heutigen Anlage, ein kleines Dreieck, dessen Spitze von der Bornheimer und der Straße „Am Alten Friedhof“ gebildet wurde. Zunächst war er nicht einmal umfriedet, so dass die Anlieger seine Grenze nicht respektierten: Joseph Clemens musste dem Hohen Weltlichen Gericht in Bonn befehlen, die Grundbesitzverhältnisse zu klären und den Friedhof absteinen zu lassen.', 'Der Nachfolger von Joseph Clemens, Kurfürst Clemens August, verfügte am 29. März 1725 noch einmal ausdrücklich, „daß hinführo alle verstorbenen Soldaten, arme Leuth, Fremde, Auswendige, und diejenige Burger oder Einwöhner hiesiger unserer Residentz, deren Kinder und Domestiquen, welche keine beständige eigene Begräbnissen binnen der Stadt in den Kirchen oder auf denen Kirchhöfen haben, wie imgleichen diejenige, deren Gräber mit Beysetzung vieler Todten angefüllet, hinführo aussen der Sternen-Pforte auf dem geweyheten sogenenten Soldaten-Kirchhof beerdiget werden.“', 'Der neue Friedhof erfreute sich zunächst keiner großen Beliebtheit; es war eine Ausnahme, wenn „Standespersonen“ dort bestattet wurden: Das Sterberegister von St. Remigius enthält am 26. März 1725 den Eintrag: „Herr Stephanus Chevalier de Chambellé, major von den Leibgarden, Oberster vom grünen Dragonerregiment (hat) vor die sternenpforte auff den newen Kirchhoff begraben zu werden selbst begehrt.“', '„Allgemeiner“ Begräbnisplatz.', 'Der letzte in Bonn residierende Kurfürst, Maximilian Franz, verordnete aus hygienischen Gründen am 5. April 1787 die Schließung der Friedhöfe in der Stadt und erklärte den Friedhof vor dem Sterntor zum „allgemeinen“ Begräbnisplatz. Er erneuerte damit für Bonn das Begräbniswesen und ging mit dieser Entscheidung anderen Städten voraus. Im benachbarten Köln war es erst die französische Besatzung, die eine solche Änderung herbeiführte, nachdem am 12. Juni 1804 Napoléon das „Décret sur les sépultures“ erlassen hatte, das die Beerdigung in Städten, Dörfern und geschlossenen Gebäuden verbot. Eine Maßnahme, die durchaus nicht bei allen auf Zustimmung stieß, denn damit war die Zeit der Bestattungen in Kirchen und auf dem Kirchhof vorbei, eine Form, die Nähe zum Altar und damit auch Nähe zu Gott und gleichzeitig hohes Ansehen bedeutete.', '„Allgemein“ war der neue Friedhof allerdings nur insoweit, als damit die christliche Bevölkerung gemeint war. Die Mitglieder der Bonner jüdischen Gemeinde bestatteten auch weiterhin auf der rechten, der Beueler Rheinseite ihre Toten. Ein jüdischer Friedhof auf der linken Rheinseite wurde erst 1872 angelegt.', 'Die Verordnung von Maximilian Franz aus dem Jahr 1787 hatte zur Folge, dass der Bonner Friedhof in seiner alten Ausdehnung bald nicht mehr genügend Platz bot und erste Vergrößerungen vorgenommen werden mussten. Von da an konnten wieder Erbgräber erworben werden. Erweiterungen in den Jahren 1831 bis 1833 wurden von Seiten der Stadt mit den Opfern einer Choleraepidemie begründet. 1840 wuchs die Friedhofsfläche sogar um mehr als das Doppelte. In den 1860er Jahren wurden weitere Landankäufe nötig, 1876 gab es schließlich die letzte Vergrößerung des Areals. Acht Jahre später, 1884, wurde der Friedhof für die allgemeinen Begräbnisse geschlossen, nachdem als Ersatz für ihn ein neuer städtischer Friedhof, der Nordfriedhof, angelegt wurde.', 'Gestaltung des Friedhofes.', 'Es ist im Besonderen das Verdienst des Oberbürgermeisters Leopold Kaufmann, dass bei der Gestaltung des Friedhofes auch gärtnerische und ästhetische Gesichtspunkte berücksichtigt wurden.

Nach der Entscheidung, aus dem Alten Friedhof einen „allgemeinen Begräbnisplatz“ zu machen, ließen sich neben den „gemeinen Einwohnern“ auch die Wohlhabenden und Prominenten der Stadt hier bestatten. Sie und ihre Angehörigen wünschten für sich in vielen Fällen mehr als ein schlichtes Grab. Sie wollten dann eine repräsentative Stätte, die über den Tod hinaus an ihr Leben erinnern und gleichzeitig für Ansehen bei den Nachgeborenen sorgen sollte.

Altern ist der bei weitem wichtigste Risikofaktor für diverse Krankheiten wie Krebs, koronare Herzkrankheit, Alzheimer-Krankheit, Parkinson-Krankheit und chronisches Nierenversagen. Die maximale Lebenszeit, die ein Individuum erreichen kann, wird durch das Altern maßgeblich beschränkt.', 'Altern ist als physiologischer Vorgang ein elementarer Bestandteil des Lebens aller höheren Organismen und eines der am wenigsten verstandenen Phänomene der Biologie. Allgemein ist die Annahme akzeptiert, dass eine Reihe verschiedener hochkomplexer, vielfach noch ungeklärter Mechanismen für das Altern verantwortlich sind. Sie beeinflussen und begrenzen die Lebensdauer von biologischen Systemen wie Zellen, den daraus aufgebauten Organen, Geweben und Organismen. Auf die Frage, warum Organismen altern, gibt es eine Vielzahl unterschiedlichster Antworten \\"(Alternstheorien)\\", aber bis heute keine wissenschaftlich akzeptierte umfassende Antwort.', 'Die Gerontologie, auch \\"Alters- und Alternswissenschaft\\" genannt, ist die Wissenschaft vom menschlichen Leben im hohen Alter und vom Altern der Menschen. Die biologische Grundlagendisziplin – ohne Fokussierung auf die Spezies Mensch – ist die Biogerontologie.', 'Definition und Abgrenzungen.', 'Für das Altern selbst gibt es keine allgemein akzeptierte wissenschaftliche Definition. Eine weiter gefasste neuere Definition sieht \\"jede im Laufe des Lebens eines Organismus stattfindende zeitgebundene Veränderung\\" als Altern an. Darunter fallen sowohl die als „positiv“ bewerteten Reifungsprozesse in der Kindheit als auch die negativ gesehenen degenerativen Erscheinungen bei alten Erwachsenen. Aus dieser Definition abgeleitet beginnt das Altern höherer Organismen unmittelbar nach der Vereinigung von Samenzelle und Eizelle und führt zu seinem Tod. Andere Gerontologen definieren das Altern nur über die negativen zeitlichen Veränderungen eines Organismus, beispielsweise den Funktionsverlust von Organen oder die Vergreisung (Seneszenz) nach dem Erwachsenwerden (Adoleszenz). Der deutsche Mediziner und Begründer der Gerontologie, Max Bürger, definierte 1960 das Altern als \\"eine irreversible zeitabhängige Veränderung von Strukturen und Funktionen lebendiger Systeme\\". Die Gesamtheit der körperlichen und geistigen Veränderungen von der Keimzelle bis zum Tod wird nach Bürger Biomorphose genannt. Welche Veränderungen man dabei dem Altern zuordnet, lässt allerdings viel Spielraum für Interpretationen. Der US-amerikanische Gerontologe Leonard Hayflick definiert Altern als \\"die Summe aller Veränderungen, die in einem Organismus während seines Lebens auftreten und zu einem Funktionsverlust von Zellen, Geweben, Organen und schließlich zum Tod führen\\". Für Bernard L. Strehler wird das Altern eines mehrzelligen Organismus durch drei Bedingungen definiert:', 'Über diese naturwissenschaftlichen Definitionen hinaus ist das Altern beim Menschen ein sozial komplexes vieldimensionales Durchlaufen der Lebensspanne von Geburt bis Tod. Die genetische Disposition und die biologischen Veränderungen sind das zentrale Element der komplexen Wechselwirkung zwischen Mensch und Umwelt. Die Vorgänge beim Altern unterliegen subjektiven, biologischen, biographischen, sozialen und kulturellen Bewertungen. Das Altern selbst ist ein Phänomen mit sowohl biologischen als auch psychischen und gesellschaftlichen Aspekten.', 'Im allgemeinen Sprachgebrauch wird \\"Altern\\" weitgehend mit negativen Veränderungen, mit Verfall, Verschlechterung und Degeneration der sensorischen und körperlichen Fähigkeiten assoziiert. Diese Veränderungen werden besser mit der Bezeichnung \\"Seneszenz\\" wiedergegeben. Die Bezeichnung \\"Alterung\\" sollte nur für unbelebte Materie verwendet werden.', 'Mit dem Begriff \\"Alter\\" sind meistens die Lebensperiode älterer Menschen, die der „Alten“, und das Ergebnis des Altwerdens gemeint. Im Gegensatz dazu geht es beim \\"Altern\\" vor allem um die Prozesse und Mechanismen, die zum Alter führen und die dem Altwerden und dem Altsein zugrunde liegen.', 'Primäres und sekundäres Altern.', 'Beim Altwerden wird zwischen zwei Formen unterschieden, dem primären und dem sekundären Altern.', 'Der Gegenstand dieses Artikels ist im Wesentlichen das primäre Altern. Die beiden Formen des Alterns lassen sich in der Praxis nicht immer eindeutig unterscheiden. Die Gerontologie ist die Alters- und Alternswissenschaft und behandelt entsprechend alle Aspekte des Alterns. Die Biogerontologie setzt sich mit den biologischen Ursachen des Alterns auseinander. Die Geriatrie ist dagegen die Lehre von den Krankheiten alter Menschen.', 'Seneszenz.', 'Seneszenz (lat. \\"senescere\\" ‚alt werden‘, ‚altern‘) ist kein Synonym für Altern. Seneszenz kann als altersbedingte Zunahme der Mortalität (Sterberate) und/oder Abnahme der Fertilität (Fruchtbarkeit) definiert werden. Altern kann zur Seneszenz führen: Die Seneszenz ist der degenerative Abschnitt des Alterns. Nur wenn die schädlichen Effekte graduell und langsam akkumulieren, sollte man von Seneszenz sprechen. Häufig lässt sich dennoch nicht sauber zwischen \\"Altern\\" und \\"Seneszenz\\" unterscheiden. Der Anfang der Seneszenz wird meist auf einen Zeitpunkt nach dem Ende der Reproduktionsphase gelegt. Dies ist eine willkürliche Festlegung, die den Vorgängen bei verschiedenen Spezies nicht gerecht wird. So zeigen Wirbeltiere Phänomene der Seneszenz wie beispielsweise die Anreicherung des Alterspigmentes Lipofuszin noch während ihrer fruchtbaren Phase und Wasserflöhe legen trotz Seneszenz bis zu ihrem Tod fertile Eier. Ein typisches Kennzeichen der Seneszenz ist der Anstieg der Mortalitätsrate über die Zeit.', 'Viele altersbedingte Veränderungen in adulten Organismen haben keinen oder kaum einen Einfluss auf die Vitalität oder Lebensdauer. Dazu gehört beispielsweise das Ergrauen der Haare durch eine verminderte Expression der Katalase \\"CAT\\" und der beiden Methioninsulfoxidreduktasen \\"MSRA\\" und \\"MSRB\\".', 'Die Alterung der Zellen (Zellalterung) wird als \\"Zellseneszenz\\" bezeichnet.', 'Lebenserwartung und Lebenspotenzial.', 'Sowohl die durchschnittliche Lebenserwartung als auch die maximal erreichbare Lebensspanne ω sind von Organismus zu Organismus sehr unterschiedlich. Eintagsfliegen und Galápagos-Riesenschildkröten sind dabei Extrembeispiele. Die statistisch ermittelte Lebenserwartung eines Individuums ist bei jedem Organismus erheblich geringer als die maximale Lebensdauer. Der Katastrophentod durch Krankheiten, Unfälle oder Prädatoren (Fressfeinde) führt dazu, dass die meisten Organismen in freier Wildbahn nicht in den Bereich ihres Wertes für ω kommen. Lediglich ein kleiner Teil der Todesfälle ist alternsbedingt. Beim Menschen kann über seine Entwicklungsgeschichte, insbesondere der letzten 100 Jahre, eine zunehmende Annäherung der mittleren Lebenserwartung der Bevölkerung an die maximale Lebensdauer beobachtet werden.', 'Nicht-biologische Formen des Alterns.', 'Neben dem biologischen Altern gibt es beim Menschen noch andere Formen des Alterns. Dazu zählt das \\"psychologische Altern\\". Darunter versteht man die Veränderungen kognitiver Funktionen, Erfahrungen des Wissens und der subjektiv erlebten Anforderungen, Aufgaben und Möglichkeiten des Lebens. Dabei können sich durch das Altern auch Stärken, wie beispielsweise bereichsspezifische Erfahrungen, Handlungsstrategien und Wissenssysteme, bilden.', 'Mit \\"sozialem Altern\\" sind die Veränderungen in der sozialen Position, die durch das Erreichen eines bestimmten Lebensalters oder einer bestimmten Statuspassage eintreten, definiert. Das Ausscheiden aus dem Berufsleben und der Eintritt in das Rentenalter ist in der Industriegesellschaft die Statuspassage, mit der das soziale Altern beginnt. Mit den Aspekten des sozialen Alterns befassen sich unter anderem die Disengagementtheorie (der selbstbestimmte Rückzug aus sozialen Kontakten), die Aktivitätstheorie und die Kontinuitätstheorie des Alterns. Die Weltgesundheitsorganisation (WHO) fördert seit den 1990er Jahren durch das Konzept des Aktiven Alterns den Versuch, bei alternden und alten Menschen Kompetenzen zu erhalten und in Form von Teilhabe wirksam werden zu lassen.', 'Vom Altern nicht betroffene Organismen.', 'Altern ist ein Vorgang, der viele höhere Organismen ihr ganzes Leben begleitet und in letzter Konsequenz zu ihrem Tod führen kann. Viele Organismen mit differenzierten somatischen Zellen („normale“ diploide Körperzellen) und Gameten (Keimzellen, das heißt haploide Zellen) mit Keimbahn altern und sind sterblich.', 'Mehrjährige Pflanzen bilden hier eine wichtige Ausnahme, da sie durch vegetative Vermehrung potenziell unsterblich sind. Im Pflanzenreich findet sich eine Vielzahl von Arten, die – nach gegenwärtigem Kenntnisstand – nicht altern. Beispielsweise produziert eine über tausend Jahre alte Stieleiche jedes Jahr Blätter und Eicheln von immer derselben Qualität. Wenn der Baum stirbt, dann durch äußere Einflüsse, wie beispielsweise Brände oder Pilzbefall.', 'Viele niedere Organismen, die keine Keimbahn aufweisen, altern nicht und sind potenziell unsterblich. Man spricht dabei auch von einer \\"somatischen Unsterblichkeit\\". Zu diesen potenziell unsterblichen Organismen gehören die Prokaryoten, viele Protozoen (beispielsweise Amöben und Algen) und Arten mit ungeschlechtlicher Teilung (beispielsweise auch Mehrzeller wie Süßwasserpolypen (\\"Hydra\\")). Faktisch haben diese Organismen allerdings sehr wohl eine begrenzte Lebensdauer. Äußere Faktoren, wie beispielsweise ökologische Veränderungen oder Fressfeinde (Prädatoren), limitieren die Lebenserwartung erheblich und führen zum sogenannten Katastrophentod.', 'Von besonderem wissenschaftlichen Interesse sind höhere Organismen, die, nachdem sie adult wurden, offensichtlich nicht weiter altern und keine Anzeichen von Seneszenz zeigen. Man spricht dabei von „vernachlässigbarer Seneszenz“ (englisch \\"negligible senescence\\"). Kennzeichen solcher Organismen sind eine über das Alter konstante Reproduktions- und Sterberate; im Gegensatz zu alternden Organismen bleibt ihre spezifische Mortalität also mit zunehmendem Lebensalter konstant. Für einige Spezies werden diese Eigenschaften vermutet. Dazu gehört beispielsweise der Felsenbarsch \\"Sebastes aleutianus\\" (englisch \\"Rougheye rockfish\\"), von dem ein 205 Jahre altes Exemplar nachgewiesen wurde, und die Amerikanische Sumpfschildkröte (\\"Emydoidea blandingii\\").

Es befindet sich am Molkenmarkt zwischen der Jüden-, Kloster-, Parochial- und Stralauer Straße.', 'Nach dem Zweiten Weltkrieg begann für das im Gegensatz zum \\"Roten Rathaus\\" weniger zerstörte Gebäude des Stadthauses eine Zeit unterschiedlicher Nutzungen. Bis 1956 war es noch ein Verwaltungsbau des Magistrat von Groß-Berlin. Dieser nutzte zusätzlich ein benachbartes Gebäude in der Parochialstraße, erbaut Mitte der 1930er Jahre und geplant durch Kurt Starcks und Franz Arnous als Geschäftshaus der Versicherung \\"Städtische Feuersozietät\\". Das Haus in der Parochialstraße übernahm damit die Funktion des Stadthauses als erweiterter Dienstsitz verschiedener Berliner Magistratsverwaltungen und so auch die Bezeichnung \\"Neues Stadthaus\\". Das ursprüngliche \\"Neue Stadthaus\\" hieß dagegen zur Unterscheidung von nun an \\"Altes Stadthaus\\", so dass in der Literatur immer wieder Verwechslungen der Bauwerke zu finden sind.', 'Von 1956 bis zum Ende der DDR diente das \\"Alte Stadthaus\\" unter anderem dem ersten Ministerpräsidenten der DDR Otto Grotewohl und dem letzten Lothar de Maizière als Amtssitz. Ab 1992 waren hier zwei Berliner Außenstellen der Bonner Bundesregierung untergebracht.', 'Mitte der 1990er Jahre begann eine umfassende Renovierung und das \\"Alte Stadthaus\\" diente danach wieder seiner ursprünglichen Verwendung als ein Gebäude der Stadtverwaltung, indem es seitdem die Berliner Senatsverwaltung für Inneres sowie das Landesdenkmalamt Berlin beherbergt.', 'Geschichte.', 'Suche nach einem „Zweiten Rathaus“.', 'Das schnelle Wachstum Berlins seit den 1860er Jahren um 50.000 Menschen jährlich brachte auch eine enorme Steigerung des Verwaltungsaufwands mit sich. Die Kapazitäten des erst 1869 fertiggestellten \\"Roten Rathauses\\" als Berliner Rathaus waren daher bald wieder erschöpft, wie ein Vergleich zeigt: Beim Baubeginn des Roten Rathauses lebten in der Stadt etwa 500.000 Einwohner, bei der Fertigstellung bereits 800.000. In der Folge stellte sich heraus, dass der Berliner Magistrat eine Zweitresidenz, eine Art „zweites Rathaus“ brauchen würde. Einen Anbau an das vorhandene Rathaus schlossen sowohl Magistrat als auch die Stadtverordneten aus, da eine Erweiterung des baulich schon geschlossenen Rathauskomplexes auf architektonisch befriedigende Weise unmöglich schien. Der Bau des neuen Hauses war vor allem mit den wichtigen Fragen des \\"wie\\" und \\"wo\\" verbunden.', '1893 schlug der Magistrat ein Grundstück am Ufer der Spree in Höhe der Waisenbrücke vor; an ungefähr dieser Stelle befindet sich heute die Berliner Finanzverwaltung und die Vertretung des Sozialverbandes Deutschland. Das vorgeschlagene Areal lehnten die Stadtverordneten jedoch ab, da sie befürchteten, dass das neue Gebäude durch seine exponierte Lage das bestehende Rathaus an Wirkung und Glanz übertreffen könne. Daher verschob man die Frage nach dem neuen, „zweiten Rathaus“ um einige Jahre. In der Zwischenzeit trat der Magistrat erneut mit Vorschlägen an die Abgeordneten heran, beide Seiten fanden jedoch wiederum keinen Konsens. 1898 griff auch der damalige Stadtbaurat Ludwig Hoffmann in die Diskussion ein, der, wie Schäche schreibt, durch „kluges Eingreifen in die Debatte [einen] Meinungsumschwung unter den Stadtverordneten“ herbeiführte. Schließlich einigten sich Berliner Magistrat und die Abgeordnetenversammlung auf das Grundstück am Berliner Molkenmarkt zwischen Jüden-, Parochial-, Kloster- und Stralauer Straße. Die auf dem anvisierten Baugrund bestehenden 32 bebauten Parzellen kaufte die Stadt nach und nach auf und ließ die vorhandenen Bauten abreißen.', 'Durch sein Eingreifen in die Debatte, aber auch durch sein gewachsenes Ansehen stand unzweifelhaft fest, dass Ludwig Hoffmann der Architekt für das neue, repräsentative Gebäude sein sollte. So bekam der damalige Stadtbaurat ohne Ausschreibung den Auftrag, ein Verwaltungsgebäude mit etwa 1.000 Arbeitsplätzen und zwei Sitzungssälen zu entwerfen. Festlegungen oder gar Einschränkungen, betreffend die Gestaltung sowie der städtebaulichen Repräsentation, gab es nicht.', 'Entwürfe für das neue Gebäude legte Hoffmann, wie er selbst in seinen Memoiren berichtet, erst Jahre später vor. Dabei gelangen ihm zwei Überraschungen, indem er die äußere Gestaltung durch einen Turm und die innere durch eine große Halle dominieren ließ. Die Ausschussmitglieder der Stadtverordnetenversammlung äußerten sich zwar zunächst kritisch dazu, votierten in der darauf folgenden Abstimmung dennoch mehrheitlich für das Konzept Hoffmanns. Die finanzielle Lage der Stadt Berlin war damals so gut, dass selbst der Stadtkämmerer weder Einwände gegen das Haus selbst noch gegen den Bau des Turms hatte.', 'Baubeschreibung.', 'Hoffmann schuf ein monumentales Gebäude mit fünf Innenhöfen, um „einmal die Büros der städtischen Verwaltungen, die im Rathaus keinen Platz haben, aufzunehmen; es sollte aber außerdem die Halle für große öffentliche Feiern enthalten, die der Stadt fehlt, und auch nach außen hin das Berlin von heute repräsentieren und also ausgesprochener monumentaler Prunkbau sein“ (Ludwig Hoffmann 1914).', 'Die Repräsentationsfunktion zeigt sich nach außen im etwa 80 Meter hohen Turm (die Angaben variieren hier), der sich auf einem quadratischen Sockel über dem Mittelrisalit an der Jüdenstraße erhebt. Der Turm besteht aus zwei Trommeln mit Säulenkranz und wird von einem Kuppelhelm gekrönt, die eine 3,25 Meter große Fortuna-Figur aus Kupfer von Ignatius Taschner trägt. Der Turm ist ein Zitat der von Carl von Gontard entworfenen Türme des Französischen und des Deutschen Domes am Gendarmenmarkt und soll aufzeigen, dass „Berlin eine in die Höhe gerichtete Entwicklung nimmt“.', 'Im Inneren ist besonders der dreigeschossige, tonnengewölbte Festsaal repräsentativ, der so genannte \\"Bärensaal\\", der in der Mitte des Gebäudes liegt. Georg Wrba gestaltete den Rosso-Verona-Marmorboden, sechs Prunkkandelaber und drei bronzene Portalgitter, die unter anderem den Saal ausschmücken. Die Halle selbst, die weder vom Magistrat noch von den Stadtverordneten verlangt worden war, sollte nach Hoffmann „eine Stadthalle für ernste Feiern“ sein und bietet etwa 1.500 Menschen Platz. An der Decke des Saales wurden 18 Reliefs mit „Bürgertugenden“ in Versform angebracht; zusätzlich schuf Georg Wrba einen großen, bronzenen Bären, der ans Ende des Saales gerückt wurde. Wrba fertigte den Bären, das Symbol der Stadt, sogar zweimal an: Zuerst in einer etwas großen Form, die der Künstler jedoch für zu herabdrückend in der 19 Meter hohen Halle fand, so dass er – ebenfalls aus Bronze – eine zweite Figur in verkleinerter Form anfertigte.', 'Der Grundriss des Gebäudes folgt als unregelmäßiges Trapez den Ausmaßen des abgerissenen Stadtquartiers. Die Seitenflügel an der Parochial- und Stralauer Straße durchstoßen als dreiachsige Seitenrisalite die Fassaden an der Jüden- und der Klosterstraße. Die Hauptachse mit der Eingangshalle und dem Festsaal liegt zwischen den fünfachsigen Mittelrisaliten an der Jüden- und der Klosterstraße. Querflügel unterteilen den Gebäudekomplex im Inneren in fünf Innenhöfe.', 'Die Fassadengliederung orientiert sich an den Formen des Palladianismus. Über dem Rustikasockel mit Erdgeschoss und der Hälfte des Zwischengeschosses erhebt sich die durch zweieinhalb Geschosse reichende toskanische Säulen- und Pilasterordnung. Mit dieser Verwischung der Grenze verletzte Hoffmann bewusst die Normen seines Vorbildes, des Palazzo Thiene in Vicenza. Die Fassade wurde in grauem Muschelkalk ausgeführt. Das Gebäude wird von einem Mansarddach bekrönt. Die Front in Richtung Jüdenstraße ist 82,63 Meter lang, in Richtung Klosterstraße 126,93 Meter, Parochialstraße 108,31 Meter sowie zur Stralauer Straße 94,46 Meter.', 'Das Stadthaus ist reich an Bildhauerarbeiten, unter anderem 19 von ursprünglich 21 Figuren als Allegorien der Bürgertugenden, die von den Bildhauern Josef Rauch, Ignatius Taschner, Georg Wrba und Wilhelm Widemann geschaffen wurden. Im Giebelfeld der Frontfassade befanden sich ursprünglich drei Berliner Stadtwappen aus der Werkstatt von Josef Rauch. Beim Umbau zum \\"Haus des Ministerrats\\" wurden sie abgenommen und durch ein DDR-Staatswappen ersetzt. Nach der Wende wurde das DDR-Wappen entfernt, die Berliner Wappen wurden jedoch bisher nicht wieder angebracht.', 'Eröffnung nach langem Warten.', 'Die Bauarbeiten zogen sich in die Länge, so dass Teile der Verwaltung, unter anderem die Hoch- und Tiefbaudeputation und die städtische Polizeiverwaltung bereits im März 1908 einzogen; Kanalisations-Deputation und städtische Feuersozietät folgten ihnen ein paar Wochen später. Der Turm selbst entstand in den Jahren 1908 bis 1911. Nach mehr als zehn Jahren Planungs- und Bauzeit eröffnete Bürgermeister Martin Kirschner am 29. Oktober 1911 das Gebäude in einer feierlichen Zeremonie. Die genaue Bauzeit betrug insgesamt neun Jahre und sechs Monate (April 1902 bis Oktober 1911).', 'Ludwig Hoffmanns Bau galt in der Bevölkerung allgemein als gelungen. Das „imposante“ Gebäude setzte einen Schwerpunkt im städtebaulichen Umfeld zwischen Molkenmarkt und Parochialkirche, wie es das eigentliche Berliner Rathaus, im Allgemeinen als \\"Rotes Rathaus\\" bekannt, zwischen Alexanderplatz und Nikolaikirche tat. Nicht umsonst bekam das in Laufnähe zu diesem gelegene Stadthaus auch den Namen „zweites Rathaus“, wofür es mit seiner Architektur geradezu prädestiniert war. In statistischer Sicht übertraf das „zweite“ das „erste Rathaus“ bei weitem: So bot das Stadthaus Raum für etwa 1.000 Arbeitsplätze städtischer Beamter, das Rote Rathaus dagegen gerade 317. Auch an Gesamtfläche war das Hoffmannsche Stadthaus mit etwa 12.600 Quadratmetern im Gegensatz zu 9.000 im alten Haus größer.', 'Weiteres Geschehen und Planungen zur Zeit des Nationalsozialismus.', 'Bis in","output":"die späten 1920er Jahre hinein diente das Alte Stadthaus weiterhin als Verwaltungsgebäude.

Im Zweiten Weltkrieg blieb das Alte Stadthaus im Gegensatz zum Roten Rathaus größtenteils verschont, wurde jedoch nach Kriegsende erneut unterschiedlich genutzt. In den 1950er Jahren wurde das Gebäude schließlich von der DDR-Regierung als Haus des Ministerrats genutzt.', 'Heute gilt das Alte Stadthaus neben dem Roten Rathaus als eines der bedeutendsten Baudenkmäler in Berlin und steht unter Denkmalschutz. Es beherbergt seit den 1990er Jahren die Berliner Senatsverwaltung für Inneres, das Landesdenkmalamt Berlin und verschiedene weitere Einrichtungen der Stadtverwaltung.'"},{"instruction":"Gib mir nur 10 Keywords bestehend aus bis zu zwei Wörtern für den folgenden Text in deiner Antwort zurück: [['Deutscher', 'Geboren 1943', 'Hochschullehrer (Justus-Liebig-Universität Gießen)', 'Hochschullehrer (Rheinische Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität Bonn)', 'Hochschullehrer (Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität)', 'Mann', 'Mitglied der Historischen Kommission für Westfalen', 'Mitglied der Vereinigung für Verfassungsgeschichte', 'Mitglied des Konstanzer Arbeitskreises für mittelalterliche Geschichte', 'Mittelalterhistoriker'], 'Gerhard „Gerd“ Althoff (* 9.

Von kaum einem anderen Historiker wurde die Ottonenzeit so intensiv erforscht wie von Althoff. Eine besonders fruchtbare Zusammenarbeit ergab sich mit seinem Münsteraner Kollegen Hagen Keller. Althoff und Keller haben mit ihren Arbeiten entscheidend zum Ansehen Münsters in der internationalen Mediävistik beigetragen. Althoffs Forschungen über die Funktionsweisen mittelalterlicher Staatlichkeit, zu den Formen öffentlicher Kommunikation, den Gruppenbindungen sowie der Konfliktbewältigung im Mittelalter üben seit den 1980er Jahren erheblichen Einfluss auf die deutsche und internationale Mediävistik aus und führten zu einer Neubeurteilung der früh- und hochmittelalterlichen Königsherrschaft.', 'Leben.', 'Gerd (eigentlich Gerhard) Althoff wurde 1943 in Hamburg geboren und wuchs im Münsterland auf. Er legte 1963 das Abitur am Amtsgymnasium in Ibbenbüren ab und studierte von 1965 bis 1970 Geschichte und Germanistik in Münster und Heidelberg. Die Beschäftigung mit Geschichte hatte als Ursachen seinen lebensweltlichen Hintergrund in der 68er-Zeit und in der Auseinandersetzung mit der Vätergeneration und ihrer jüngeren Vergangenheit. Althoff begann seine wissenschaftliche Laufbahn in Münster im Projekt „Personen und Gemeinschaften“, das Karl Schmid im Sonderforschungsbereich 7 „Mittelalterforschung“ leitete. Seine erste wissenschaftliche Veröffentlichung behandelte eine Prümer Mönchsliste im \\"Liber Aureus\\" („goldenes Buch“) und erschien 1973 in den \\"Frühmittelalterlichen Studien\\". Ein Jahr später wurde er in Münster bei Schmid mit einer Arbeit über das Nekrolog des westfälischen Frauenklosters Borghorst promoviert.', 'Für die nächsten sechs Jahre arbeitete er als Wissenschaftlicher Assistent an der Universität Freiburg im Breisgau, wo er sich 1981 mit der Arbeit „Adels- und Königsfamilien im Spiegel ihrer Memorialüberlieferung“ habilitierte. 1986 wurde Althoff als Nachfolger von Peter Johanek auf eine Professur für mittelalterliche Geschichte an die Universität Münster berufen. 1990 wechselte er als Nachfolger von Carlrichard Brühl auf den Lehrstuhl für Mittelalterliche und Neuere Geschichte nach Gießen. Dort war Althoff von 1991 bis 1995 Mitinitiator und Betreuer des Graduiertenkollegs „Mittelalterliche und Neuzeitliche Staatlichkeit“. An der Universität Gießen war er 1992 Geschäftsführender Direktor des Historischen Instituts und 1993/94 Dekan des Fachbereichs Geschichte. 1995 wurde Althoff Nachfolger von Rudolf Schieffer als Professor für das Fach Mittelalterliche und Neuere Geschichte an der Universität Bonn. Dort hielt er im Dezember 1995 seine Antrittsvorlesung über \\"Empörung, Tränen, Zerknirschung. ‘Emotionen’ in der öffentlichen Kommunikation des Mittelalters.\\" In Bonn war er 1996 Geschäftsführender Direktor des Historischen Seminars. Im Sommersemester 1997 kehrte er als Nachfolger von Joachim Wollasch auf die Professur für Mittelalterliche Geschichte nach Münster zurück. Seine Antrittsvorlesung hielt Althoff über die Bedeutung von symbolischer Kommunikation für das Verständnis des Mittelalters. 1998/99 war er Geschäftsführender Direktor des Historischen Seminars der Universität Münster. 2011 wurde er dort emeritiert. In seiner Abschiedsvorlesung sprach Althoff über „Das hochmittelalterliche Königtum“. Zu seinen akademischen Schülern zählen unter anderem die heutigen Professoren Claudia Garnier, Hermann Kamp, Steffen Krieb und Christiane Witthöft. Sein Nachfolger in Münster wurde 2011 Wolfram Drews. Althoff hatte Gastprofessuren an der University of California, Berkeley (1995), der École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales (EHESS) in Paris (1998) und der Lomonossow-Universität in Moskau (2011). An den Ausstellungen „Goldene Pracht. Mittelalterliche Schatzkunst in Westfalen“ in Münster und „Spektakel der Macht“ in Magdeburg war er maßgeblich beteiligt. Althoff war für die Zeit vom 1. November 2015 bis 31. Oktober 2016 als Seniorprofessor an der Universität Münster tätig.', 'Für seine Leistungen erhielt Althoff 2005 den mit 30.000 Euro dotierten Forschungspreis der Universität Münster. Dort nahm Althoff zahlreiche wissenschaftsorganisatorische Tätigkeiten wahr. 1997 wurde er Direktor des Instituts für Frühmittelalterforschung in Münster. Althoff war langjähriger Herausgeber (2001–2011) und ist Mitherausgeber (1998–2001; seit 2012) der \\"Frühmittelalterlichen Studien\\". Er war außerdem von 1988 bis 1991 Projektleiter des Sonderforschungsbereichs 231 (SFB) „Träger, Felder, Formen pragmatischer Schriftlichkeit im Mittelalter“ und wurde 1997 Betreuer des Graduiertenkollegs „Schriftkultur und Gesellschaft im Mittelalter“. Von 1991 bis 1998 war er Fachgutachter der Deutschen Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) und von 1997 bis 2003 Mitinitiator und Sprecher des SFB „Symbolische Kommunikation und gesellschaftliche Wertesysteme vom Mittelalter bis zur Französischen Revolution“, bei dem er selbst das Teilprojekt „Konflikt- und Friedensrituale im Spätmittelalter“ leitete. Von 2007 bis 2011 war Althoff Sprecher des Exzellenzclusters „Religion und Politik in den Kulturen der Vormoderne“.

Im Juli 2008 wurde ihm in Münster anlässlich seines 65. Geburtstages ein internationales Kolloquium („Spielregeln, Gewohnheiten und Konventionen im Mittelalter“) gewidmet. Die Beiträge sind 2010 in einer Festschrift erschienen.', 'Forschungsschwerpunkte.', 'Seine Forschungsschwerpunkte sind die Funktionsweisen mittelalterlicher Staatlichkeit, die Konfliktführung und -beilegung im Mittelalter, die Formen und Rahmenbedingungen öffentlicher Kommunikation (so genannte symbolische Kommunikation) sowie die Gruppenbindungen. Seine zahlreichen Aufsätze seit den 1980er Jahren zu diesen Forschungsschwerpunkten wurden von der Wissenschaftlichen Buchgesellschaft in zwei Sammelbänden (1997: \\"Spielregeln der Politik im Mittelalter. Kommunikation in Frieden und Fehde\\" und 2003: \\"Inszenierte Herrschaft. Geschichtsschreibung und politisches Handeln im Mittelalter\\") veröffentlicht. Zu Standardwerken wurden seine zahlreichen Studien über die Ottonen- und Salierzeit sowie die Darstellungen \\"Verwandte, Freunde und Getreue\\" und \\"Die Macht der Rituale\\". Ein besonders fruchtbarer Austausch fand bei den Themen ottonische Geschichtsschreibung, Gruppenverhalten und Staatlichkeit mit seinem Münsteraner Kollegen Hagen Keller statt. 1985 verfasste Althoff zusammen mit Keller eine Doppelbiographie der beiden ersten ottonischen Herrscher Heinrich I. und Otto der Große. Sie konnten herausarbeiten, dass Heinrich seine Herrschaft mit Hilfe von Freundschaftsbündnissen \\"(amicitiae)\\" festigte. Abweichend von der älteren Auffassung deuteten Althoff und Keller Heinrichs Salbungsverzicht nicht mehr als kirchenfeindlichen Zug, sondern als Verzicht auf wesentliche Prärogative des Königtums, um die Königsherrschaft gegenüber dem Adel zu konsolidieren. Auch das anachronistische Deutungsmodell von einer starken und machtvollen Königsgewalt gegenüber dem widerspenstigen Adel wurde überwunden. Heinrich I. und Otto I. waren für Althoff und Keller nicht mehr Symbole für Deutschlands frühe Macht und Größe, sondern eher ferne Repräsentanten einer archaischen Gesellschaft. Althoff legte 1996 zu dem Ottonen Otto III. und 2006 zu dem Salier Heinrich IV. eine Biographie vor. Beide Biographien gelten als Standardwerke. Althoff initiierte 2006 eine Frühjahrstagung des Konstanzer Arbeitskreises auf der Insel Reichenau zum 900. Todesjahr Heinrichs IV. Dabei standen bei den Referenten – unter anderem Tilman Struve, Rudolf Schieffer, Steffen Patzold, Claudia Zey, Matthias Becher und Stefan Weinfurter – die vielen Vorwürfe gegen Heinrich im Mittelpunkt der Diskussion. Althoff ist zusammen mit Keller der Verfasser des Bandes zur Zeit der Spätkarolinger und Ottonen der 2008 erschienenen Ausgabe im „Gebhardt“, dem grundlegenden Handbuch zur deutschen Geschichte. Ihr erklärtes Ziel mit dem dritten Band des neuen „Gebhardt“ ist eine „grundlegende Revision des überkommenden Geschichtsbildes“, also die „Entnationalisierung des Bildes vom ottonischen Reich“. Bereits acht Jahre zuvor hatte Althoff eine Überblicksdarstellung zu den Ottonen geliefert.', 'Im Jahr 2011 legte Althoff zusammen mit Christel Meier eine Darstellung über die Ironie im Mittelalter vor. Sie leisteten mit ihren Forschungen über dieses Thema einen „Neuanfang für zukünftige Forschung“. Im Rahmen des Exzellenzclusters „Religion und Politik in den Kulturen der Vormoderne und der Moderne“ veröffentlichte Althoff 2013 die Studie \\"Selig sind, die Verfolgung ausüben\\" über Päpste und Gewalt im Hochmittelalter. Die Päpste haben nach Althoffs Forschungen eigene Theorien zur Rechtfertigung von Gewalt entwickelt, um auf diese Weise die Geltungsansprüche auf Vorrang in der Welt zu rechtfertigen. Dabei rückte die Frage des Gehorsams als neue Leitkategorie in den Vordergrund. Ungehorsam wurde als Häresie angesehen, gegen die man mit Gewalt vorgehen durfte. Die Resonanz auf dieses Buch fiel vor allem wegen des Aktualitätsbezuges, des ideengeschichtlichen Ansatzes und der quellenbasierten Argumentationsstruktur weitgehend positiv aus. ', 'Auf der Grundlage seiner Forschungen zu den politischen Spielregeln, Ritualen und der symbolischen Kommunikation legte Althoff 2016 eine systematische Darstellung der politischen Beratung des mittelalterlichen Königs und der Funktion herrscherlicher Berater vor. Die Mittelalterforschung hatte der Beratung des mittelalterlichen Königs durch Mitglieder seines Herrschaftsverbandes bis dahin wenig Beachtung geschenkt.

Ein durchgängiges auftaktiges Metrum ist dem Text unterlegt: Jamben mit jeweils drei Hebungen.', 'Die Form wird in der Literatur als Volksliedstrophe bezeichnet. „Volkslieder“ folgen allerdings nicht einer bestimmten Form; so findet sich etwa in der bekannten Volksliedsammlung „Des Knaben Wunderhorn“ eine große Vielfalt von variabel gehandhabten Metren, Reimschemata und Strophenformen. Die Form der Volksliedstrophe war aber bei den Romantikern als liedhafte, sangbare, Schlichtheit suggerierende Gedichtform sehr beliebt und bereits etabliert. Ein Beispiel ist das zehn Jahre ältere Gedicht Eichendorffs „Das zerbrochene Ringlein“, an dessen Beginn „In einem kühlen Grunde/Da geht ein Mühlenrad“ der Lindenbaum anklingt. Müller handhabt das Formschema in diesem Gedicht jedoch sehr streng und verzichtet auf jegliche Variationen.', 'Fast alle Gedichte der \\"Winterreise\\" sind in ähnlicher Form metrisch und formal gebunden. Der „ruhige Fluss der Verse“, der dadurch entsteht, wird von den düsteren Themen und Stimmungen der Winterreise kaum berührt, wie Rolf Vollmann feststellt. Dieser Kontrast hat starke Wirkungen, Vollmann spricht gar von „Entsetzen“.

Noch vor deren Beginn liegt eine gescheiterte Liebesbeziehung des Protagonisten, eines jungen Mannes, der das Lyrische Ich verkörpert. Das erste Lied des Zyklus, \\"Gute Nacht\\", beschreibt die Ausgangssituation: Das „Ich“ verlässt in einer Winternacht das Elternhaus der Geliebten und begibt sich auf eine einsame, ziellose Wanderung, deren Stationen die Gedichte des Zyklus wiedergeben. Zu diesen Stationen zählen vereiste Flüsse und verschneite Felsenhöhen, Dörfer und Friedhöfe – und eben auch der Lindenbaum.', 'Die \\"Winterreise\\" ist als „Monodrama“ beschrieben worden oder auch als eine Folge von „Rollengedichten“. In allen Stationen spricht nur das Lyrische Ich mit sich selbst, aber auch mit der Natur oder mit seinem Herzen. Einige Motive wiederholen sich immer wieder: Liebe und Todessehnsucht, der Gegensatz der erstarrten Winterlandschaft und der fließenden Emotionen (vor allem in Gestalt der Tränen), Trotz und Resignation, vor allem aber das wie getriebene, zwanghafte Wandern.', 'Auffallend im gesamten Zyklus sind die sprachlichen Gegensätze (heiße Tränen – Schnee, Erstarren – Schmelzen etc.), die auch dem auf feine Nuancierungen verzichtenden Volkslied eigen sind. Nach Erika von Borries gelingt es Müller, eingebettet in alte und naiv-vertraut wirkende Formen, die Erfahrungen einer Moderne zu vermitteln. Die Leitmotive des \\"Lindenbaums\\", Traum und Ruhe, tauchen mehrmals im Zyklus mit jeweils unterschiedlichen Bedeutungen auf – diese Mehrdeutigkeit steht nach von Borries für die dichterische Darstellung einer unverlässlich gewordenen Welt.', 'Der Zyklus und der Begriff \\"Winter\\" (siehe Heines \\"Wintermärchen\\") sei nach Achim Goeres als Metapher für eine Politik der Restauration nach dem Wiener Kongress zu verstehen.

Erst mit der dritten Strophe nimmt das Ich Bezug auf die Handlung der \\"Winterreise\\"; es beginnt zu erzählen, nämlich von einem nur kurz zurückliegenden Ereignis: Es ist („heute“) an dem Lindenbaum vorbeigekommen. Die sechste Strophe enthält einen Rückblick des Ichs, der in der erzählten Gegenwart steht („nun“).', 'Das erste Verspaar bringt mit Brunnen, Tor und Lindenbaum klassische Bestandteile eines ‚lieblichen Orts‘ oder Locus amoenus. Ihm folgt eine Reihe durchaus konventioneller Bilder (süßer Traum, liebes Wort, Freud und Leid), die ans Klischee grenzen und eine vergangene glückliche Zeit an diesem Ort evozieren. Es ist gerade dieser Teil des Liedes, der etwa in den Darstellungen auf Postkarten so gern im Bild wiedergegeben wird. Im Verhältnis zu den anderen Naturbildern der \\"Winterreise\\", die von Fels, Eis und Schnee bestimmt sind, wirkt das Ensemble Brunnen/Tor/Lindenbaum wie eine idyllische Insel.', 'Mit der dritten Strophe wechselt nicht nur die zeitliche Einordnung, sondern auch die Stimmung abrupt. Die statische Idylle wird durch die rastlose, erzwungene Bewegung des lyrischen Ichs kontrastiert, die am Lindenbaum vorbeiführt. Obwohl ohnehin „tiefe Nacht“ herrscht, verweigert der Wanderer den Blickkontakt: „Er will oder kann nicht hingucken.“ Doch die Magnetwirkung, die dem Lindenbaum bereits oben zugesprochen wurde („es zog […] zu ihm mich immer fort“), verwirklicht sich über einen anderen Sinn, das Gehör: Das Rauschen der blattlosen Zweige, das der Wanderer als Lockruf und Versprechen hört. Christiane Wittkop weist auf die dunklen u-Vokale hin, die dieses Versprechen auf Erlösung vom Weiterwandern prägen (zu, Ruh) – und auf die hellen a- und i-Vokale, die die folgende Strophe deutlich davon absetzen (kalten, grad, Angesicht, Winde, bliesen). Diese fünfte Strophe läuft erstmals auf eine bewusste Handlung des lyrischen Ich zu: Es widersteht dem Lockruf des Baumes; dieser Entschluss erhält einen eigenen Vers, den vierten Vers dieser Strophe, während sonst die Sinneinheiten regelmäßig zwei Verszeilen umfassen. Das Ich entscheidet sich für das schutzlose Weiterwandern (ohne Hut) und präsentiert der Kälte und Wucht des Windes sein Gesicht.', 'Den Übergang zur sechsten Strophe zeichnet erneut ein abrupter Stimmungswechsel aus. Nun kommt die Erzählsituation ins Bild: das sich erinnernde und erzählende Ich, „manche Stunde“ entfernt von den Ereignissen der letzten drei Strophen. Die letzte Strophe greift erneut das Moment der Zeitlosigkeit („immer“) auf, das die ersten beiden Strophen prägte, und ebenso die Anrede der Lindenbaum-Zweige aus Strophe 4, die nun jedoch im Irrealis steht („fändest“). Sie kann als eine Art bleibendes Resümee aus der Distanz betrachtet werden („jenem Ort … dort“).', 'Formale und inhaltliche Textinterpretationen.', 'Sowohl Müllers Text als auch die beiden musikalischen Ausdeutungen des Textes haben Interpretationen und Deutungsmuster im rein auf Müller, Schubert und Silcher bezogenen literaturwissenschaftlichen und musikwissenschaftlichen Bereich, aber auch im weiteren Bezug von Musiksoziologie, Geschichtswissenschaft, Germanistik und Psychologie hervorgerufen.', 'Müllers Zyklus lässt sich unter dem Aspekt der Verwendung sprachlicher Formen, aber auch im Hinblick auf den intendierten Bedeutungsrahmen (individuelles oder allgemein Menschliches oder auch historisch-politische Bedeutung) unterschiedlich interpretieren.

Jahrhundert)', 'Historische christliche Bewegung', 'Häresiegeschichte (Mittelalter)', 'Pantheismus'], 'Die Amalrikaner (mittellateinisch \\"Amauriani\\", französisch \\"Amauriciens\\") waren eine religiöse Bewegung des frühen 13. Jahrhunderts in Frankreich, die sich auf die theologischen Lehren des 1205/1206 gestorbenen Magisters Amalrich von Bena berief. Inwieweit sie tatsächlich Amalrichs Position vertraten, ist unklar. Den Kern bildete eine Gruppe von Klerikern, die an der Universität von Paris an Amalrichs Unterricht teilgenommen hatten. Sie verbreiteten nach seinem Tod ihre Ideen in weiten Kreisen und wandten sich in der altfranzösischen Volkssprache an die Laien. Damit popularisierten sie eine theologische Thematik, die gewöhnlich nur von Gelehrten in mittellateinischer Sprache erörtert wurde. Nach wenigen Jahren machten sie sich mit ihrem Auftreten verdächtig; die Anführer wurden 1210 verhaftet, als Häretiker kirchlich verurteilt und großenteils auf dem Scheiterhaufen hingerichtet. In den frühen 1210er Jahren wurde die Bewegung anscheinend durch die Verfolgung vollständig ausgelöscht.', 'Da die Schriften der Amalrikaner vernichtet wurden, können ihre Lehren nur aus den Angaben der Gegner und einem überlieferten amalrikanischen Gebet rekonstruiert werden. Ihre Theologie und Naturphilosophie war pantheistisch. Sie meinten, Gott sei immer und überall in allem auf dieselbe Weise anwesend und wirksam. Von dieser Überzeugung ausgehend lösten sie sich von dem kirchlichen Dogma einer einzigartigen geschichtlichen Offenbarung Gottes in Christus. Unter „Auferstehung“ und „Himmelreich“ verstanden sie nichts anderes als die befreiende Erkenntnis der Wahrheit, unter „Hölle“ den Zustand der Unwissenheit. Wer die Wahrheit erkannt habe, der ersetze Glauben und Hoffnung durch Wissen und benötige die kirchlichen Sakramente nicht mehr. Das Heil erlange der Mensch durch die Einsicht, dass Gott in ihm und allen anderen ebenso wie in Christus Gestalt angenommen habe. Mit diesen Thesen formulierten sie eine radikale Alternative zur damals herrschenden kirchlichen Lehre.', 'Der historische Verlauf.', 'Amalrich von Bena und seine Lehrtätigkeit.', 'Der Gründer oder zumindest Inspirator der Gruppe war Amalrich von Bena (lateinisch Amalricus de Bena, französisch Amaury de Bène, auch Amalrich von Chartres). Er stammte aus dem Dorf Bène im Gebiet von Chartres, wurde wohl um 1140/1150 geboren und erhielt wahrscheinlich in Chartres seine erste Ausbildung. Entweder schon dort oder später an der Pariser Universität eignete er sich eine gründliche Kenntnis der Sieben Freien Künste \\"(septem artes liberales)\\" an. In Paris erwarb er den Grad eines Magister artium und damit die Qualifikation, in der Fakultät der Freien Künste zu lehren. Zuvor muss er bereits die niederen Weihen empfangen haben. An der Pariser Universität absolvierte er auch ein Theologiestudium, das er wohl mit dem Grad eines Magisters der Theologie abschloss. Zu einem unbekannten Zeitpunkt wurde er zum Priester geweiht. Als Lehrer genoss er einen ausgezeichneten Ruf, insbesondere auf dem Gebiet der Logik. Daher machte ihn König Philipp II. Augustus anscheinend zum Erzieher seines 1187 geborenen ältesten Sohnes und Thronfolgers, der später als Ludwig VIII. die Herrschaft antrat. Jedenfalls stand Amalrich zumindest zeitweilig dem Kronprinzen nahe.', 'Mit seinem sehr unkonventionellen Denken und seinem Widerspruchsgeist erregte Amalrich bei seinen Kollegen Anstoß; auch durch seine Lehrweise unterschied er sich von ihnen. Anscheinend lehrte er nicht an der theologischen Fakultät, sondern an der Fakultät der Freien Künste. Dennoch befasste er sich in seinem Unterricht auch mit theologischen Fragen. Dabei scheute er sich nicht, den traditionellen Konsens zu verlassen und allein gegen alle eine gewagte Außenseitermeinung zu vertreten. Er scharte einen großen Schülerkreis um sich.', 'Der zeitgenössische Geschichtsschreiber Guillelmus Brito berichtet von einem Konflikt, der schon zu Amalrichs Lebzeiten wegen der kühnen theologischen Behauptungen des eigenwilligen Magisters ausgebrochen sei. Nach der Darstellung des Guillelmus stieß Amalrich mit seinen Thesen auf den Widerspruch aller anderen Theologen. Da er nicht nachgegeben habe, sei der Fall Papst Innozenz III. vorgetragen worden. Amalrich sei nach Rom gereist, um seine Lehre dort zu verteidigen, doch habe der Papst sein Urteil gegen ihn gefällt. Nach seiner Rückkehr sei Amalrich von der Universität gezwungen worden, einen Widerruf zu leisten, doch habe er sich nur zum Schein von seinen Überzeugungen abgewandt. Die Niederlage habe ihn schwer getroffen, bald danach sei er tödlich erkrankt. Ob dieser Bericht glaubwürdig ist, ist in der Forschung umstritten. Dagegen spricht das Schweigen mancher anderer Quellen, in denen nicht davon die Rede ist, dass das kirchliche Lehramt schon vor dem Tod des Magisters eingeschritten sei. Daher verdient der Bericht des Guillelmus nach der Einschätzung von Ludwig Hödl keinen Glauben; Amalrich sei in Wirklichkeit bis zu seinem Tod unbehelligt geblieben. Anderer Meinung sind Johannes M. M. H. Thijssen und Paolo Lucentini. Sie halten die Überlieferung für vertrauenswürdig und sehen in dem Vorgang den ältesten dokumentierten Fall eines Lehrbeanstandungsverfahrens an der Pariser Universität. Da Amalrich 1205 oder 1206 starb, dürfte der Konflikt, falls er tatsächlich stattfand, um 1204/1205 ausgebrochen sein und die Verurteilung der „Irrlehre“ wohl 1205/1206 erfolgt sein.', 'Die Entstehung und Ausbreitung der amalrikanischen Bewegung.', 'Ob schon zu Amalrichs Lebzeiten eine zumindest locker organisierte Gruppe bestand, die seiner Lehre folgte, ist unbekannt. Jedenfalls lebte sein Gedankengut nach seinem Tod in der Schar seiner Schüler und Anhänger, der „Amalrikaner“ \\"(Amauriani)\\", fort. Der Kern der Gruppe, die sich offenbar organisatorisch konsolidierte, bestand aus Klerikern, darunter Magister der Universität, doch beschränkte sich die Bewegung nicht auf Gebildete. Die Amalrikaner traten aus dem engen Bereich der lateinischsprachigen Gelehrtenwelt, in dem sich ihr Lehrmeister bewegt hatte, heraus und bemühten sich mit beträchtlichem Erfolg, breitere Kreise für ihre Ideen zu gewinnen. Zu diesem Zweck wandten sie sich in der französischen Volkssprache an die Bevölkerung. Sie verbreiteten die neue Lehre in der Kirchenprovinz Sens, zu der neben dem Erzbistum Sens die Bistümer Auxerre, Chartres, Meaux, Nevers, Orléans, Paris und Troyes gehörten, sowie in den Bistümern Amiens und Langres. Amalrikanische Theologen, die in Paris studiert hatten, wurden Landseelsorger und trugen die Botschaft in ihre Pfarreien; Prediger waren vielerorts unterwegs. Dass diese Tätigkeit gefährlich war, war ihnen bewusst; aus den Angaben der Quellen geht hervor, dass sie einerseits große Resonanz suchten und unter den Ungebildeten starken Zuspruch fanden, andererseits aber heimlich und vorsichtig vorgehen mussten. Auch Frauen schlossen sich der Bewegung an. Von der Bevölkerung wurden die Amalrikaner auch \\"Beginen\\" und \\"Papelarden\\" genannt; offenbar setzte man sie mancherorts mit den Beginen und Begarden gleich, einer damals noch jungen spirituellen Strömung, die ebenfalls als Alternative zur herkömmlichen, gängigen religiösen Praxis wahrgenommen wurde. Zur schnellen und weiten Verbreitung des neuen Gedankenguts trug der Umstand bei, dass die Amalrikaner im Ruf der Ehrenhaftigkeit \\"(honestas)\\" und einer von Charakterstärke geprägten Lebensweise \\"(vitae gravitas)\\" standen. Eine hierarchische Organisation scheint bei ihnen nicht bestanden zu haben, doch gab es Wortführer \\"(maiores)\\", die anleitende und lehrende Funktionen übernahmen und die Botschaft als Prediger verkündeten.', 'Unklar ist, inwieweit die Thesen der Amalrikaner der authentischen Doktrin Amalrichs entsprachen. Es gab Handbücher, in denen die Lehre des verstorbenen Initiators der Bewegung systematisch dargestellt wurde \\"(summe de doctrina Amalrici)\\". Sie bildeten die theoretische Grundlage, aber anscheinend nicht im Sinne einer starr fixierten Dogmatik; vielmehr kam es nach Amalrichs Tod, der eine gravierende Zäsur darstellte, zu einer Weiterentwicklung und neuen Akzentsetzungen. Guillelmus Brito berichtet, die Häretiker hätten nach dem Tod ihres Lehrmeisters „neue und unerhörte Irrtümer und teuflische Erfindungen ersonnen“.', 'Die Aufdeckung.', 'Über die Aufdeckung der amalrikanischen Aktivitäten durch das kirchliche Lehramt liegen zwei zeitgenössische Berichte vor: die Darstellung des Guillelmus Brito und eine ausführlichere Schilderung im \\"Dialogus miraculorum\\" \\"(Dialog über die Wunder)\\" des Zisterziensermönchs Caesarius von Heisterbach. Caesarius widmete in seinem Werk den Amalrikanern ein umfangreiches Kapitel, das er im Jahr 1223 verfasste.', 'Nach Guillelmus’ Angaben kam die Nachricht von der neuen Häresie auf verborgenem Weg dem Bischof von Paris, Peter von Nemours (Pierre II de la Chapelle), zu Ohren. Auch Guérin (Garinus), der Kanzler von Frankreich, der ein bedeutender Ratgeber König Philipps II. war, erfuhr davon. Die beiden Würdenträger beschlossen, einen Magister namens Radulf von Namur als Spitzel in die verdächtige Bewegung einzuschleusen. Radulf war nach Guillelmus’ Worten ein listiger und wahrhaft katholischer Mann, der es „auf wunderbare Weise“ schaffte, sich bei den Amalrikanern als einer der ihren auszugeben. So gelang es ihm, ihr Vertrauen zu gewinnen. Er suchte sie einzeln auf und brachte sie im vertraulichen Gespräch dazu, ihm ihre Geheimnisse zu enthüllen. Nachdem er genug Belastungsmaterial gesammelt hatte, denunzierte er seine Gesprächspartner. Sie wurden verhaftet und nach Paris gebracht.', 'Eine davon etwas abweichende und detailliertere, aber im Wesentlichen mit Guillelmus’ Angaben vereinbare Schilderung bietet Caesarius von Heisterbach. Er erzählt, ein Anhänger der Bewegung namens Wilhelm „der Goldschmied“ sei zu Radulf (hier Rudolf) von Namur gekommen und habe sich als Bote Gottes ausgegeben, um ihn für die Häresie zu gewinnen. Wilhelm habe behauptet, es beginne nun das neue Zeitalter des Heiligen Geistes, in dem die kirchlichen Sakramente ihre Bedeutung verlören. Der Heilige Geist werde sich hauptsächlich durch sieben Männer offenbaren, von denen er, Wilhelm, einer sei.

Feuerbach malte das Bild während eines längeren Aufenthaltes in Rom.', 'Der Gegenstand des Bildes geht auf die Sage der Amazonen im Trojanischen Krieg zurück.', 'Hintergrund.', 'Erste Amazonenschlacht (Ölstudie).', 'Das erste Werk Feuerbachs, das die Amazonenschlacht zum Thema hatte, entstand Ende 1856 und war 1857 vollendet. Doch schon 1845 hatte Feuerbach an einer ähnlichen Schlachtenszene gearbeitet: \\"Die Erstürmung des germanischen Lagers in der Schlacht auf den Raudischen Feldern\\". Die Arbeit mit Pinsel in verschiedenen Brauntönen und Deckweiß über Bleistift auf hellbraunem Papier ist sein erstes Schlachtenbild. Am 29. September 1845 war es in den Maßen 29,7 mal 38,3 cm vollendet und befindet sich heute im Kupferstichkabinett der Staatlichen Museen zu Berlin. Feuerbachs Bekannter und Biograf Julius Allgeyer beurteilte die Zeichnungen zu der Germanenschlacht treffend als „Zeugnis kindischen Ungeschicks“ nach Konzeption und Ausführung, sieht aber auch den Zusammenhang mit den späteren Fassungen der Amazonenschlacht „gleichsam in embryonischer Form vorgebildet“. Erst wenige Wochen zuvor hatten er und Feuerbach sich in Rom kennengelernt.', 'Die erste Fassung einer Amazonenschlacht, die Feuerbach 1856–57 schuf, hat die Form eines Querovals, die der Künstler in der Frühphase seiner Zeit in Rom bevorzugte. Die kompositorischen Probleme dieser Form löste Feuerbach im Vergleich zu seinen Nymphenbildern. Die Landschaft – ein karger Küstenstrich – baut sich vom Hintergrund in den Vordergrund stufenweise auf. Die S-förmig angelegten Figuren bilden zwei Gruppen, in denen theatralische Einzelinszenierungen aneinandergefügt werden. Die Szene wirkt durchkomponiert und geordnet, obwohl man bei dem Thema des Bildes Verwirrung und Getümmel erwartet. Der Kunsthistoriker Ulrich Christoffel lobt in seiner 1944 erschienenen Monographie über Feuerbach dessen dynamisches Flächengefühl und seinen „Sinn für die kontrapunktische Verteilung von Masse und Licht“. Jürgen Ecker bezeichnet in seinem 1991 erschienenen Werk über Feuerbach die Ölstudie als ein kompositorisches Experiment Feuerbachs und weniger als eine glaubhafte Darstellung des Themas. Die Ölstudie mit den Maßen von 53 mal 64,5 cm befindet sich heute im Landesmuseum für Kunst und Kulturgeschichte in Oldenburg.', 'Vorarbeiten zur ersten Gemäldefassung.', 'Nach Fertigstellung der Ölstudie 1857 beschäftigte Feuerbach sich weiterhin mit dem Gedanken der Darstellung einer Amazonenschlacht. In einem Brief an seine Stiefmutter Henriette Feuerbach vom 10. Januar 1860 beschreibt er seine Begeisterung über die Komposition seines ersten Entwurfs zur Amazonenschlacht und drückt seine Entschlossenheit aus, die Thematik zu verfolgen.', 'In den 60er Jahren des 19. Jahrhunderts arbeitete Feuerbach kontinuierlich auf die erste Gemäldefassung der Amazonenschlacht hin: Im „Städelschen Kunstinstitut Frankfurt“ befindet sich eine gezeichnete Teildarstellung der Szene, ein beigefügtes Blatt im Münchner Skizzenbuch in der „Staatlichen Graphischen Sammlung“ und in Hamburg, Leipzig und Dresden einige Kreidedarstellungen weiblicher Akte.', 'In die Zeit zwischen der Ölstudie und der ersten Gemäldefassung der „Amazonenschlacht“ fällt Feuerbachs Bekanntschaft mit Anna Risi, genannt „Nanna“. Bis 1865 ist sie seine Geliebte und sein wichtigstes Modell.', 'Entstehung, Aufbau und Rezeption der ersten Gemäldefassung.', 'Am 3. Februar 1868 kündigte er in einem Brief an, er sei mit seinem Werk \\"Orpheus und Eurydike\\" befasst und werde in der nächsten Woche die Amazonenschlacht in Angriff nehmen. Feuerbach verkündet am 12. März dieses Jahres die Herstellung eines Rahmens für die \\"Amazonenschlacht\\". Mit der Untermalung auf Leinwand hatte er zu diesem Zeitpunkt bereits begonnen, allerdings fehlten ihm noch Naturstudien, besonders an Pferden. Er berichtet im selben Brief seiner Stiefmutter, dass er aus diesem Grund viel Zeit im Heidelberger Marstall zu verbringen gedenke. Schließlich unterbrach Feuerbach die Arbeit an dem Bild und erwähnt es in seinen Briefen das ganze Jahr über nicht mehr. In einem undatierten Brief, wahrscheinlich vom Februar 1869, berichtet er, dass er in acht Tagen die Schlacht anfangen werde. Im Oktober 1869 entschließt sich Feuerbach, das Bild ungestört zu vollenden, beendet es aber auch im Dezember nicht.', 'Wieder spielt die Schlacht in einer kargen Küstenlandschaft, die im Verlauf der beiden Bilddiagonalen komponiert ist. Der Schwerpunkt der Handlung befindet sich links von der Bildmitte und bildet ein rechtwinkliges Dreieck. Durch die versetzte Überlagerung zweier Kompositionsprinzipien entsteht eine Spannung im Bild, die von den Figuren der Schlacht – wie in der ersten Amazonenschlacht 1857 – nicht ausgeht. Die feindlichen Mächte sind nicht in Schlachtordnung und Formation gegeneinander ausgerichtet, sondern zerstreuen sich in Einzelaktionen über das Bild. Die Vielzahl der im Bild verwendeten Zitate trägt ebenfalls nicht zur Spannung bei: Es finden sich Ableitungen von Michelangelos Liegefiguren der Medicigräber, die Landschaft im rechten Bilddrittel hat dasselbe Motiv wie Feuerbachs Federzeichnung \\"Medea tötet ihre Kinder\\" (Ashmolean Museum, Oxford). Die erste Gemäldefassung der Amazonenschlacht maß 1,20 mal 2,77 Meter und befand sich zuletzt in der Nationalgalerie Berlin, bevor sie im Zweiten Weltkrieg in einen Charlottenburger Flakturm ausgelagert und zerstört wurde.', 'Als Feuerbachs Bekannter und vormaliger Interessent Konrad Fiedler im Spätherbst 1869 diese Amazonenschlacht in Feuerbachs Atelier entdeckte, reagierte er verhalten und peinlich berührt. Feuerbach machte sich recht bald an die Arbeiten zu seiner zweiten Gemäldefassung der Amazonenschlacht.', 'Weiterentwicklung zur zweiten Gemäldefassung.', 'Im Herbst 1870 kündigte Feuerbach in einem Brief lakonisch an, er werde am 1. Dezember die Arbeiten zu seinem \\"Gastmahl\\" und der \\"Amazonenschlacht\\" aufnehmen und ohne weitere Studien an der Natur arbeiten. Am 2. Februar 1871 meldete er, fünf Mappen Handzeichnungen mit über 250 Entwürfen für die Schlacht angefertigt zu haben. Er beschrieb den zügigen Fortgang der Vorbereitungsarbeiten für die Gemäldefassung der Amazonenschlacht in Lebensgröße und verkündete stolz: „Die Schlacht wird von dämonischer Wirkung.“ Für die meisten dargestellten Amazonen stand Feuerbachs Geliebte Lucia Brunacci Modell. Die vielen Studien zeigten Feuerbachs ernsthaftes Bemühen um eine glaubhafte figürliche Darstellung in seiner zweiten und endgültigen Fassung der Amazonenschlacht. Im November 1871 verkündete Feuerbach die Fertigstellung des Gemäldes, im Januar und Februar 1872 ging er es akribisch durch und korrigierte Feinheiten.', 'Als Feuerbach 1873 im Rahmen seiner Berufung an die „Akademie der Bildenden Künste“ nach Wien zog, ließ er sich das \\"Gastmahl\\" und die \\"Amazonenschlacht\\" unverzüglich nachschicken. Das Schlachtenbild, das nach Feuerbachs Bekunden fast das ganze Atelier einnahm, gab er sofort zur Spannung und war „trotz der Nuditäten“ vom Adel und der Größe seines Werks eingenommen. Im November 1873 wurde das Bild gefirnisst.', 'Das Gemälde.', 'Der Gegenstand des Bildes geht auf die Sage der Amazonen im Trojanischen Krieg zurück, wie sie uns aus dem Epos \\"Ilias\\" überliefert ist, das dem griechischen Dichter Homer zugeschrieben wird. Unter Führung ihrer Königin Penthesilea kommen sie dem trojanischen König Priamos zu Hilfe, der von den Griechen unter Führung von König Menelaos von Sparta angegriffen wird. Im Kampf gegen die Griechen wird Penthesilea vom legendären Krieger Achilles getötet, der sich in sie verliebt, als er der sterbenden Amazone den Helm abnimmt. Entgegen den Bräuchen, nach denen die Leichname der Feinde nach der Schlacht den Aasfressern überlassen werden, übergibt Achilles den der Penthesilea an die Trojaner.', 'Wieder zeigt Feuerbachs freie Behandlung des Sagenstoffes keine Schlacht im eigentlichen Sinn. Wenngleich die zwei großen, gegenläufigen Bewegungsrichtungen zwei aufeinanderprallende Schlachtordnungen suggerieren, sind auch die Figuren der zweiten Fassung der \\"Amazonenschlacht\\" nur in Einzelszenen addiert. Die links im Hintergrund heransprengende Amazonenschar greift zwar eine weiter rechts befindliche Gruppe Männer an, doch die Zwecklosigkeit dieser Attacke ist daraus ersichtlich, dass es sich bei den Männern nur um Verwundete handelt. Auch wenn diese Szene inhaltlich sinnlos wirkt, hat sie doch formale Funktion: Sie leitet die Bewegungsszene im Hintergrund ein, die sich noch in den Wolken fortsetzt und im rechts davonrasenden Pferd ausklingt. Der Geier im linken Teil durchbricht die Bewegungsrichtung. Während in der ersten Gemäldefassung die Bucht das gesamte rechte Bilddrittel einnahm, reduzierte Feuerbach sie in der zweiten Fassung auf einen schmalen Küstenstreifen, den Porto d’Anzio, in den er auch den Landschaftsausschnitt mit dem fliehenden Pferd aufnahm. Der einzige Ruhepol im rechten Bilddrittel ist eine kleine Szene: Ein Schimmel beugt sich über die Leiche einer Frau.', 'Die Einzelkämpfe im Vordergrund sind sämtlich dezentral angesetzt. Ein Trapez rechts von der linken unteren Ecke hin zur Bildmitte fängt den Blick des Betrachters rasch ein: Er wird von einer monumentalen Rückenfigur dominiert, die auf Michelangelos Leda zurückgeht. Sie bleibt vom Geschehen in der Gasse unberührt und verteilt, in sich ruhend, die verschiedenen Bewegungsrichtungen des Vordergrunds. Um sie sind fünf Amazonen gruppiert, teils verwundet, teils gefallen, die einen Rahmen um die Rückenfigur bilden. Dieser Rahmen bildet die innere von zwei Ellipsen, die sich um die Rückenfigur ziehen.

Mit diesem Auto wollte AMC dem ähnlich konzipierten De Tomaso Pantera einen Konkurrenten entgegensetzen. Das Karosseriedesign und der Antrieb kamen von AMC, Fahrwerk und Chassis wurden in Europa entwickelt. Die Konstruktion wurde allgemein Giotto Bizzarrini zugeschrieben. Allerdings stammen nur einzelne Komponenten wie die Aufhängung von ihm. Neben Bizzarrini waren auch Italdesign, Autocostruzioni S.D. und BMW an der Entwicklung beteiligt. Kurz nach der Präsentation gab AMC das Projekt ohne Angabe von Gründen auf, nachdem etwa ein halbes Dutzend Autos entstanden war. Mehrere Versuche, die Konstruktion ohne AMC-Beteiligung unter dem Markennamen Bizzarrini – unter anderem als Bizzarrini Sciabola – wiederzubeleben, blieben erfolglos. Ein AMX/3-Chassis bildete 1972 die technische Basis für das Konzeptfahrzeug Iso Varedo.', 'Hintergrund.', 'Der AMX/3 entstand als Reaktion auf die wirtschaftliche Krise des AMC-Konzerns. AMC, der kleinste der vier großen US-amerikanischen Autokonzerne, hatte in der ersten Hälfte der 1960er-Jahre erhebliche Einbußen hinnehmen müssen, was vor allem mit einer technisch anspruchslosen, vielfach als bieder empfundenen Modellpalette erklärt wurde. AMC versuchte deshalb zum Ende des Jahrzehnts zunächst, mit sportlichen Varianten der Volumenmodelle jüngere Käufer anzusprechen, war damit aber weitgehend erfolglos. Das zum Modelljahr 1968 eingeführte \\"Pony-Car\\" Javelin kam im Vergleich zur Konkurrenz drei Jahre zu spät, und das vom Javelin abgeleitete zweisitzige Fließheckcoupé AMX bekam als frühes \\"Muscle-Car\\" zwar eine gute Presse, verkaufte sich aber – möglicherweise wegen zu großer stilistischer Nähe zu den Standardmodellen von AMC – deutlich schlechter als erwartet.', 'Um der Marke AMC ein sportliches Image zu geben, verfolgte das Management seit 1967 das Ziel, die Modellpalette um einen Hochleistungssportwagen mit Mittelmotor zu ergänzen. Auslöser waren vor allem die Motorsporterfolge des entsprechend konstruierten Ford GT40, die Ford werbewirksam zu nutzen verstand und die auch die GM-Marke Chevrolet zur Entwicklung des Konzeptautos Astro II veranlasst hatten. Im Frühjahr 1968 zeigte AMC zunächst den stilistisch vom De Tomaso Mangusta beeinflussten AMC AMX/2, der ein reines \\"Show Car\\" war und in dieser Form keine Aussicht auf eine Serienproduktion hatte. Dieser Entwurf wurde zum AMX/3 weiterentwickelt, der bereits seriennah gestaltet war.', 'Im Herbst 1968 fiel die Entscheidung, den AMX/3 in Serie zu produzieren. Vornehmlicher Rivale sollte der zu dieser Zeit noch in der Entwicklung befindliche De Tomaso Pantera sein, von dem bereits klar war, dass Ford ihn in den USA über sein Händlernetz vertreiben würde.', 'Nachdem mehrere Prototypen fertiggestellt waren, ließ AMC im März 1970 Werbefotos vor dem Kolosseum in Rom produzieren. Am 23. März 1970 stellte AMC den Wagen in Rom der italienischen und am 4. April 1970 in New York der amerikanischen Presse vor. Beide Termine lagen jeweils einen Tag vor der örtlichen Präsentation des De Tomaso Pantera. Ab dem 5. April 1970 stand der AMX/3 schließlich auf der New York Auto Show, wo auch der Pantera debütierte. Unterstützend fuhr Giotto Bizzarrini einige Demonstrationsrunden auf dem Michigan Speedway. Wenig später – je nach Quelle Ende April oder im Sommer 1970 – gab AMC den AMX/3 allerdings überraschend auf. Gründe für die Beendigung wurden nicht genannt. Bis dahin hatte AMC etwa 2 Mio. US in das Projekt investiert.', 'Modellbezeichnung.', 'Die Abkürzung AMX steht für American Motors Experimental (sinngemäß: Versuchsmodell der American Motors Company). Seit 1968 verwendete AMC sie für einen in Serie produzierten Sportwagen mit Frontmotor. Das Mittelmotorcoupé erhielt zu Beginn der Entwicklungsphase die Bezeichnung AMX/3; sie war auch als Verkaufsbezeichnung des letztlich nicht verwirklichten Serienmodells vorgesehen. Die 3 – für das dritte Experimentalfahrzeug – wurde typografisch zumeist mit einem Schrägstrich angebunden. Dieser Schriftzug findet sich auf einigen Prototypen. Abweichend davon verwendete AMC allerdings bei mindestens einem Prototyp die Schreibweise AMX III. Eine zeitgenössische Skizze zeigt außerdem ein Fahrzeug mit dem Schriftzug AMX/K, wobei das K für den Karosseriehersteller Karmann steht.', 'Entwicklungsgeschichte.', 'Die Entwicklungsgeschichte des AMC AMX/3 ist nicht in allen Einzelheiten geklärt. An ihrem Anfang stand das Karosseriedesign, für das innerhalb von sieben Monaten in weiteren Schritten ein Chassis und ein Fahrwerk sowie eine Karosseriestruktur konstruiert wurden, bevor ein Testprogramm mit mehreren Prototypen durchgeführt wurde. An diesem Prozess waren zahlreiche europäische Dienstleister beteiligt, von denen drei zu dieser Zeit geschäftlich eng miteinander verbunden waren.', 'Planungen bei AMC.', 'Die Entscheidung, die Entwicklung und die Produktion des AMX/3 auf europäische Betriebe auszulagern, hatte finanzielle Gründe. Das Management hoffte, auf diese Weise die Produktionskosten und den Verkaufspreis niedrig zu halten. Die Serienfertigung sollte der deutsche Karosseriehersteller Karmann übernehmen, der in Rheine schon seit 1968 die für Europa bestimmten Exemplare des AMC Javelin aus zerlegt angelieferten Teilesätzen montierte. Die Planspiele sahen vor, die Produktion des AMX/3 nach einer ersten Serie von 24 Autos auf 1000, nach anderen Quellen sogar 5000 Autos jährlich zu erhöhen, die sowohl in den USA als auch in Europa verkauft werden sollten. Andere Quellen meinen, AMC habe zunächst 5000 Fahrzeuge jährlich als Produktionsziel ausgegeben und dies später auf 24 Autos pro Jahr reduziert. Als Verkaufspreis waren 10.000 bis 12.000 US vorgesehen. Das war etwa das Dreifache eines zeitgenössischen, während ein Ferrari 365 GTB/4 „Daytona“ für 19.900 US angeboten wurde.', 'AMC Design Center.', 'Das Karosseriedesign des AMX/3 entstand im Frühjahr 1968. Es wurde AMCs eigenem Designstudio zugeschrieben, das Richard „Dick“ Teague leitete. Die Detailarbeiten verrichteten Vince Geraci, Jack Kenitz, Chuck Mashigan und Robert „Bob“ Nixon. Teague deutete in späteren Jahren an, dass während des Designprozesses „viel Arbeit“ auf den Spezialbetrieb Creative Industries of Detroit ausgelagert worden sei, spezifizierte das aber nicht näher.', 'Im Herbst 1968 entstand nach den Entwürfen der AMC-Designer ein als \\"Pushmobile\\" bezeichnetes 1:1-Modell aus glasfaserverstärktem Kunststoff, das nicht fahrbereit war, keinen Motor, keine Lenkung und kein Interieur hatte und im Innern von einem Metallgerüst zusammengehalten wurde. Nach seiner Fertigstellung wurde ihm in einem Designwettbewerb ein Alternativvorschlag von Giorgio Giugiaros Studio Italdesign gegenübergestellt, der unter Zeitdruck parallel zum \\"Show Car\\" Bizzarrini Manta entstanden war und als „schwer und unausgereift“ bzw. „unfertig und lieblos“ wahrgenommen wurde. Am Ende gewann der AMC-Entwurf.', 'Bizzarrini und Italdesign.', 'Weil AMC in den 1960er-Jahren ausschließlich Serienfahrzeuge mit Frontmotor und Hinterradantrieb im Programm hatte, konnte der als Mittelmotorwagen konzipierte AMX/3 nicht auf vorhandener Serientechnik aufbauen. „Mangels eigenen Know-Hows“ suchte AMC nach einer Möglichkeit, die Technik des Mittelmotorsportwagens von einem externen Spezialbetrieb konstruieren zu lassen, wobei vor allem aus Kostengründen europäische Dienstleister herangezogen wurden. In der frühen Planungsphase erwog AMC, den AMX/3 komplett bei BMW konstruieren zu lassen, was aber an fehlenden Kapazitäten bei BMW scheiterte. Auf Vermittlung Pininfarinas oder Karmanns ging AMC daraufhin im November 1968 eine Verbindung mit dem Ingenieur Giotto Bizzarrini ein, der seit 1954 Renn- und Sportwagen für Alfa Romeo, Ferrari, A.T.S., Lamborghini, Iso und seine eigene Marke konstruiert hatte und in dem Ruf stand, einer der besten Automobilingenieure Italiens zu sein. Bizzarrini, der seinen Betrieb einen Monat vorher durch eine Insolvenz verloren hatte, war daraufhin als freiberuflicher Konstrukteur für AMC tätig. Er fertigte bereits im Dezember 1968 die ersten Zeichnungen für Fahrwerksteile an. AMC bewarb den AMX/3 daraufhin als Bizzarrini-Konstruktion. Tatsächlich beschränken sich Bizzarrinis Beiträge aber auf einzelne Komponenten des Autos. Giotto Bizzarrini erklärte später, AMC habe von ihm „ein Chassis und eine Aufhängung“ verlangt. Allerdings ist nur die Radaufhängung nachweislich eine Bizzarrini-Konstruktion. Der Rahmen hingegen wurde von Giorgio Giugiaros Unternehmen Italdesign entwickelt, das sich nicht nur als Designstudio verstand, sondern auch als Konstruktionsdienstleister. Auf wessen Initiative Italdesign beteiligt wurde und wie genau die Arbeitsteilung mit Bizzarrini war, ist nicht geklärt. Das Engagement Italdesigns dauerte von Dezember 1968 bis Juni 1969; AMC machte es aber nicht öffentlich bekannt.', 'Autocostruzioni S.D. (Diomante).', 'Einer Quelle zufolge beauftragte AMC zunächst den Turiner Karosseriehersteller Coggiola mit dem Bau der Prototypen. Coggiola begann im Spätherbst 1968 mit dem ersten AMX/3, stellte ihn aber nicht fertig. Aus unbekannten Gründen wurde der Prototypenbau zum Jahreswechsel 1968/69 auf den neu gegründeten Betrieb Autofficina Salvatore Diomante übertragen, der wenig später in Autocostruzioni S.D. umfirmierte. Der Betrieb ist landläufig auch als Diomante bekannt. Sein Gründer Salvatore Diomante war bis 1968 Werksleiter bei Automobili Bizzarini gewesen. Diomante hatte seinen Sitz zuerst im bisherigen Bizzarrini-Werk in Livorno. Hier entstand – möglicherweise auf der Basis von Coggiolas Vorarbeiten – im Frühjahr 1969 der erste Prototyp des AMX/3. Später verlegte Diomante den Betrieb nach Moncalieri bei Turin; dort wurden alle übrigen AMX/3 gebaut.', 'BMW.', 'Mit Testfahrten und der Überarbeitung des Fahrwerks wurde schließlich BMW beauftragt, wo das Projekt den Entwicklungscode E18 bekam. BMW unternahm ab Juni 1969 Testfahrten mit dem ersten Prototyp und stellte dabei erhebliche Defizite fest. So erwies sich das Fahrwerk als deutlich zu schwach ausgelegt, sodass es sich bei starker Beschleunigung und starker Verzögerung gleichermaßen verformte.

Erano anni che l’estate era sparita. Il freddo si era esteso a tutte le stagioni, quindi non c’era da sorprendersi che il cielo fosse sempre grigio, la pioggia cadesse con discreta regolarità e gli albergatori balneari stessero fallendo uno dopo l’altro. In qualunque continente ci si trovasse, gelo e pioggia si erano impadroniti del globo. In compenso le condizioni delle metropoli erano assai migliorate. Iniziarono a spuntare come funghi edifici altissimi, dei veri e propri spazi a misura d’uomo dove i cittadini si sentivano protetti e al sicuro. Le elezioni erano state vinte per la terza legislatura di seguito dai cosiddetti DB: amavano definirsi un gruppo dedito al miglioramento del genere umano, che secondo loro era ottenibile solo concentrando gli sforzi su scienza e tecnologia. Per questo motivo, avevano sempre garantito alti livelli di confort e sicurezza ai cittadini. Con una maggioranza in parlamento ed un esecutivo così ben disposti nei confronti della tecnologia, lo Stato Klavatreano, che occupava tutta la fascia occidentale del continente Americano, divenne ben presto il luogo più vantaggioso per corporazioni tecnologiche, delle quali la DST aveva avuto più fortuna. DST stava per Dob Systems & Technologies, una megacorporazione che aveva filiali in tutto il mondo, il cui patrimonio si aggirava intorno ai novecento miliardi. Le ragioni di questo successo erano tante e sinergiche. Anzitutto la fondatrice, Michelle Suzanne Dob era laureata in ingegneria elettrica ed al suo fianco c’erano le migliori menti del tempo. In seguito i prodotti della DST, pur essendo tutti elettronici o alchemici, spaziavano dai più disparati settori. Il terzo motivo stava nella semplicità ed efficienza dei suoi prodotti. Il bilocale in cui viveva Dylan era provvisto di alcune di tali tecnologie: l’accesso a internet era fornito dalla presa di corrente, senza necessità di altri fili, così come in tutta la regione. Non aveva avuto modo di approfondire, ma pareva che il segnale di rete venisse aggiunto direttamente nel contatore. Per migliorare l’efficienza di tale sistema inoltre, fase e neutro erano schermati a norma di legge. Una placca controllava la porta, interfacciandosi col sistema alchemico di Dylan e verificava in lui la presenza o meno di un codice a 256 bit. Tutto quel che doveva fare era appoggiare il dito e MainDOB faceva il resto. Quanto al microcomputer da polso, il discorso era analogo. Quello nella sua testa era più che sufficiente, ma talvolta c’era necessità di caratteristiche non impiantate. In quel momento Dylan era appollaiato sul letto singolo coi piedi scalzi, mentre guardava un’intervista del Kommander Aedostul, il capo del governo. Tutto usando solo il sistema nella sua testa. «Guardatevi attorno, cittadini» disse Aedostul con una voce suadente, profonda ed emotiva. «Guardate quel che abbiamo creato. Non è meraviglioso? Non è forse quel che avete sempre desiderato?» Aedostul aveva capelli neri ben curati, trattenuti col gel. E proprio come Dylan, occhi azzurri. Aedostul aveva però un’aria da intellettuale ed era un po’ più alto. Indossava sempre abiti eleganti. In quell’intervista, ad esempio, camicia bianca con giacca color navy e una sottile cravatta nera. Dylan apprezzava moltissimo Aedostul. Non soltanto per la somiglianza di capelli e di occhi – che notavano tutti – ma anche perché era un uomo che non si scomponeva mai, sempre pronto a riflettere intelligentemente su ogni problematica. Oltretutto Aedostul possedeva un lessico vasto, si esprimeva in modi colti e con un tono allo stesso tempo autorevole e comprensivo Dylan aveva interrotto il filmato, forse per udire le gocce di pioggia picchiettare contro il vetro della finestra, quando all’interfaccia di MainDOB si aggiunse in primo piano un pannello blu scuro con scritte bianche. COMUNICAZIONE IN ARRIVO – VALIS Sotto c’erano due pulsanti. Uno rosso per attaccare e uno verde per rispondere alla comunicazione. Dylan si concentrò su quello verde. «Cosa vuoi?» chiese Dylan. «Zanner e Rutis vogliono vederti» spiegò Valis. Dylan alzò lo sguardo. Probabilmente riguardava la scorsa missione, volevano che facesse rapporto o qualcosa del genere. «Bene. Dì loro che sarò lì tra un quarto d’ora» e qui il tono calmo e freddo di Dylan tornò in gioco. Udì Valis replicare qualcosa, ma aveva già attaccato. Lasciò perdere l’interfaccia per concentrarsi sulla desolazione nella sua stanza. Dinnanzi a sé c’era la cosiddetta bandiera di Aedostul: uno sfondo blu con due strisce nere sulla destra e una bianca a sinistra. Tale bandiera era universalmente riconosciuta come il simbolo dei DB e molto presente negli spazi pubblici o luoghi dello Stato – come la caserma a cui apparteneva – ma era raro trovarla in case private. Almeno che non fosse la casa di un fervido sostenitore del partito quale lui era. Aedostul aveva scritto alcuni libri, come ad esempio Lost Elite, Manifesto dei DB, Una nuova era ed altri, tutti presenti su uno scaffale a sinistra. Dylan aveva letto ognuno di essi più volte, ma non erano neppure sufficienti data la complessa mole degli argomenti trattati da Aedostul. Per cui viveva con la costante impressione di non averli compresi appieno, o che il suo punto di vista fosse in qualche modo falsato. Dylan non possedeva molti beni, non perché non poteva permetterseli, più che altro non gli interessavano. C’erano alcune attrezzature sportive, vari altri libri e una piccola collezione di armi da fuoco e spade. Il gas era troppo raro e costoso per l’impiego civile, ma non l’elettricità: I fornelli erano a induzione e poco usati, in quanto si nutriva prevalentemente di proteine e legumi. Da civile Dylan era solito indossare abiti grigi, celesti o neutri, coi capelli pettinati prepotentemente in avanti. Il completo da incursore, ben tenuto alla sua sinistra e già stirato, era blu a tinta unita, se non fosse per lo sbocco delle maniche, i gomiti e le spalle, che invece erano nero. I colori della bandiera di Aedostul venivano riciclati in ogni modo possibile – pensò Dylan – ed altre uniformi presentavano combinazioni diverse. Con gli stivali militari neri era tornato l’incursore giurato che era solito essere. Poi, ignorando lo stato in cui era la sua abitazione, ne uscì chiudendosi dietro la porta. DYLAN NEAR diceva la targhetta fuori dalla porta, anche se era solo un pezzo di carta stampato, ritagliato e attaccato col biadesivo. Avrebbe voluto aggiungere Incursore ma era proibito dalle regole condominiali. Comunque già tutti in città sapevano chi era e cosa facesse. «Il lavoro chiama?» disse una voce di vecchia. Era la signora Yashmil, un’anziana signora coi lineamenti antipatici e i capelli diradati. Una vicina tranquilla pensava Dylan, se non fosse per il volume della televisione sempre sparato alle stelle. Si limitò ad annuirle. «Voi ragazzi state facendo proprio un bel lavoro. Ad averti come vicino, mi sento più tranquilla» Dylan le rivolse un sorriso falso e sforzato «Scientia Perfectio Est» disse Dylan. Quello era il motto dei DB, che significava la conoscenza è perfezione. Era ben consapevole che non c’entrasse nulla, ma gli venne improvvisa voglia di fare lo splendido. Colpita e affondata, la signora Yashmil si limitò a fissare Dylan con silente ammirazione. Lui commentò qualcosa, poi scese le scale. Si trovava al nono piano e tutti gli altri usavano l’ascensore. Ma lui voleva tenersi in allenamento. Infine si trovò nella città. Una città con grandi grattacieli e luci digitali sullo sfondo. Alla sua sinistra due robot curavano le aiuole condominiali, di fronte un asfalto ben piatto di buona qualità. Anche i pali della luce erano in ottime condizioni e illuminavano la strada con una forte luce bianca. I negozi del piano terra avevano tutti vetrine di plexiglas dove i loro prodotti erano esposti. Al termine del viale, in una piazzola, un enorme schermo a led mostrava inserzioni pubblicitarie. Quella era Nordent, una città, lo dice il nome, a nord della Nazione, distante qualche chilometro dalla vallata di Iron Mountain. Era nel pieno del suo sviluppo, con impalcature sparse in giro, gli alti grattacieli di cemento e acciaio che parevano voler schiacciare i minuscoli pendolari intenti a recarsi da qualche parte, tra le luci dei semafori, degli schermi pubblicitari e i led agli ingressi degli edifici. In un incrocio si vedevano i binari del tram colmi di gente seria e silente tornare dal lavoro, vestiti in maniera impeccabile come si raccomandava. Eppure era anche un luogo dove ci si sentiva straordinariamente soli: A parte Dylan, in circolazione erano rimaste ben poche persone, su cui lo spazio urbano e artificiale dominava con fermezza. Il verbo dell’era blu come Aedostul chiamava quel presente, era il sopravvento della tecnologia e della scienza sull’essere umano. Come risultato erano state costruite – e si stavano ancora costruendo – più cose di quante fossero necessarie anche nella migliore delle ipotesi. Era come se l’aria fosse satura di qualche nuova energia che si poteva sfogare solamente dando seguito alla propria manualità e al proprio ingegno. Non soltanto era difficile immaginare un ambiente “aperto” non saturo di edifici ammassati stretti gli uni sugli altri, ma anche senza dispositivi alchemici ed elettronici dei quali il mondo sembrava pieno fino a scoppiare. Ad ogni angolo ovunque si trovasse, c’era sempre una luce lampeggiante collegata a un computer, intenta a segnalare qualche cosa. Anche pensandoci bene era impossibile fare a meno di tutte quelle innovazioni tecnologiche: Gli ingressi avevano placche simili a quella dell’appartamento di Dylan, le operazioni bancarie erano ormai svolte solo elettronicamente, così come gli acquisti, la guida di autovetture, registrarsi da qualche parte e persino per parcheggiare era necessario comunicarlo online (ogni luogo aveva un modello 3d virtuale). Di tutto ciò si poteva ringraziare MainDOB, soprannominato il sistema operativo universale, che faceva funzionare ogni cosa. Il sistema operativo della DST aveva generato come effetto collaterale una certa uniformità di design, tanto nelle interfacce elettroniche che come estetica degli oggetti. In compenso tutto era interconnesso e compatibile con qualsiasi altra macchina, ed era un risultato assolutamente fantastico. MainDOB, inoltre, era programmabile fino ad un certo punto, consentendo automazioni che si adattavano ad ogni esigenza. Ma la vera svolta stava nei biosistemi come quello che aveva impiantato Dylan, in cui il confine tra pensiero e informazione esterna…non era poi così definito. Gli bastava immaginare qualcosa, come un’immagine e trasferirla a MainDOB, che poteva memorizzarla sul disco di sistema o persino condividerla o stamparla. Qualcuno – non lui – poteva persino avere lunghe conversazioni senza aprire bocca. Oppure guardare un film, ascoltare musica senza muovere un muscolo. Il fatto che MainDOB – tra le altre cose – facesse funzionare anche le apparecchiature esterne e la sua predisposizione all’interoperabilità, poteva rendere possibili azioni che fino a quel momento erano state solo sognate, come spegnere le luci col pensiero o usare la telepatia per vedere cosa accadeva in casa quando si è via. Della tecnologia alchemica Dylan sapeva tristemente poco, ma l’unica cosa di cui era certo – e lo sapeva anche un bambino – era che l’alchimia era fatta della stessa sostanza di cui sono fatti i pensieri, e in quanto tali mutavano. Ecco quindi il nome alchimia. Come facesse funzionare anche computer e dispositivi elettronici, era un mistero che aveva sempre affascinato Dylan (ed era abbastanza facile svelarlo con una semplice ricerca) ma preferiva mantenere l’immagine di Michelle Suzanne Dob, la geniale fondatrice della DST, come un’eroina capace di fare l’impossibile. Un’altra innovazione della DST erano i piccoli robot metallici intenti a lavorare in un cantiere sul lato destro della strada. Il nome ufficiale era un’improponibile sigla di numeri e lettere, ma tutti li chiamavano Dob’s Children o figli di Dob. Piccoli umanoidi in alluminio e plastica biancastra con telecamere-occhi lunatici, la testa tonda e bombata e l’espressione che esprimeva un tenero mix infantile di sorpresa e timidezza. Non erano solo dotati di articolazioni piuttosto agili per degli androidi, ma erano in grado di eseguire ogni compito che il loro proprietario gli avesse spiegato in modo sufficientemente chiaro. Bastava esprimersi in linguaggio naturale e, se una persona vera era in grado di capire, anche un child poteva farlo. Ad esempio, nel caso di un ordine come “lava i piatti e mettili nel secondo cassetto”, il child già intuiva che il cassetto in questione non poteva essere quello della dispensa. Se una volta aperto non c’era il contenuto aspettato, lo richiudeva per tentare da un’altra parte. Un prodigio della robotica alla quale i competitor della DST non erano riusciti neanche ad avvicinarsi, nonostante numerosi tentativi. Come altri manufatti dell’azienda erano provvisti di un meccanismo interno antianalisi che sovraccaricava l’androide appena qualcuno provava a smontarlo. L’alchimia inoltre, per sua stessa natura, era di difficile interpretazione. Lo stesso Dylan si era ripromesso di acquistarne uno appena avrebbe potuto permetterselo – stava contenendo le spese proprio a tale scopo – non che gli servisse a granché, ma era una di quelle esperienze da provare. E poi chi avrebbe mai detto di no a un servitore fedelissimo pronto ad eseguire ogni ordine in qualsiasi momento?","output":"Erano anni che l'estate era sparita. Il freddo si era esteso a tutte le stagioni, quindi non era molto sorprendente che il cielo fosse sempre grigio, la pioggia cadesse con discreta regolarità e gli albergatori balneari fallissero uno dopo l'altro. In qualunque continente ci si trovasse, gelo e pioggia avevano preso il controllo del globo. In compenso, le condizioni delle metropoli erano notevolmente migliorate. Iniziarono a spuntare come funghi edifici altissimi, dei veri e propri spazi a misura d'uomo dove i cittadini si sentivano protetti e al sicuro. Le elezioni erano state vinte per la terza legislatura consecutiva dai cosiddetti DB: amavano definirsi un gruppo dedito al miglioramento del genere umano, che secondo loro era ottenibile solo concentrando gli sforzi su scienza e tecnologia. Per questo motivo, avevano sempre garantito alti livelli di comfort e sicurezza ai cittadini. Con una maggioranza in parlamento ed un esecutivo così ben disposti nei confronti della tecnologia, lo Stato Klavatreano, che occupava tutta la fascia occidentale del continente americano, divenne ben presto il luogo più vantaggioso per le corporazioni tecnologiche, tra cui la DST aveva avuto più fortuna. DST stava per Dob Systems & Technologies, una megacorporazione con filiali in tutto il mondo, il cui patrimonio si aggirava intorno ai novecento miliardi. Le ragioni di questo successo erano tante e sinergiche. Innanzitutto, la fondatrice Michelle Suzanne Dob era laureata in ingegneria elettrica ed aveva al suo fianco le migliori menti del tempo. Inoltre i prodotti della DST, pur essendo tutti elettronici o alchemici, spaziavano nei più disparati settori. Il terzo motivo stava nella semplicità ed efficienza dei suoi prodotti. Il bilocale in cui viveva Dylan era dotato di alcune di queste tecnologie: l'accesso a internet era fornito dalla presa di corrente, senza necessità di altri fili, così come in tutta la regione. Non aveva avuto modo di approfondire, ma pareva che il segnale di rete venisse aggiunto direttamente nel contatore. Per migliorare l'efficienza di tale sistema, inoltre, fase e neutro erano schermati a norma di legge. Una placca controllava la porta, interfacciandosi con il sistema alchemico di Dylan e verificava in luila presenza o meno di un codice a 256 bit. Tutto ciò che doveva fare era appoggiare il dito e MainDOB faceva il resto. Quanto al microcomputer da polso, il discorso era analogo. Quello nella sua testa era più che sufficiente, ma talvolta c'era necessità di caratteristiche non impiantate. In quel momento, Dylan era appollaiato sul letto singolo con i piedi scalzi, mentre guardava un'intervista del Kommander Aedostul, il capo del governo. Guardava usando solo il sistema nella sua testa. \\"Guardatevi attorno, cittadini\\", disse Aedostul con una voce suadente, profonda ed emotiva. \\"Guardate ciò che abbiamo creato. Non è meraviglioso? Non è forse ciò che avete sempre desiderato?\\" Aedostul aveva capelli neri ben curati, trattenuti con il gel. E proprio come Dylan, aveva occhi azzurri. Tuttavia, Aedostul aveva un'aria da intellettuale ed era un po' più alto. Indossava sempre abiti eleganti. In quell'intervista, ad esempio, indossava una camicia bianca con giacca color navy e una sottile cravatta nera. Dylan apprezzava moltissimo Aedostul. Non soltanto per la somiglianza dei capelli e degli occhi - che tutti notavano - ma anche perché era un uomo che non si scomponeva mai, sempre pronto a riflettere intelligentemente su ogni problema. Inoltre, Aedostul possedeva un lessico vasto, si esprimeva in modo colto e con un tono allo stesso tempo autorevole e comprensivo. Dylan aveva interrotto il filmato, forse per udire le gocce di pioggia picchiettare sul vetro della finestra, quando all'interfaccia di MainDOB si aggiunse in primo piano un pannello blu scuro con scritte bianche. COMUNICAZIONE IN ARRIVO - VALIS Sotto c'erano due pulsanti. Uno rosso per rifiutare e uno verde per rispondere alla comunicazione. Dylan si concentrò su quello verde. \\"Cosa vuoi?\\" chiese Dylan. \\"Zanner e Rutis vogliono vederti\\" spiegò Valis. Dylan alzò lo sguardo. Probabilmente riguardava la scorsa missione, volevano che facesse rapporto o qualcosa del genere. \\"Bene. Dì loro che sarò lì tra un quarto d'ora\\", rispose con tono calmo e freddo. Dylan udì Valis replicare qualcosa, ma aveva già terminato la chiamata. Lasciò perdere l'interfaccia per concentrarsi sulla desolazione nella sua stanza. Davanti a sé c'era la cosiddetta bandiera di Aedostul: uno sfondo blu con due strisce nere sulla destra e una bianca a sinistra. Tale bandiera era universalmente riconosciuta come il simbolo dei DB e molto presente negli spazi pubblici o luoghi dello Stato - come la caserma a cui apparteneva - ma era raro trovarla in case private. A meno che non fosse la casa di un fervido sostenitore del partito quale lui era. Aedostul aveva scritto alcuni libri, come ad esempio Lost Elite, Manifesto dei DB, Una nuova era ed altri, tutti presenti su uno scaffale a sinistra. Dylan aveva letto ognuno di essi più volte, ma non erano neppure sufficienti data la complessa mole degli argomenti trattati da Aedostul. Perciò viveva con la costante impressione di non averli compresi appieno o che il suo punto di vista fosse in qualche modo distorto. Dylan non possedeva molti beni, non perché non poteva permetterseli, ma più che altro non gli interessavano. C'erano alcune attrezzature sportive, vari altri libri e una piccola collezione di armi da fuoco e spade. Il gas era troppo raro e costoso per l'impiego civile, ma non l'elettricità: i fornelli erano ad induzione e poco usati, in quanto si nutriva prevalentemente di proteine e legumi. Da civile Dylan era solito indossare abiti grigi, celesti o neutri, con i capelli pettinati prepotentemente in avanti. Il completo da incursore, ben tenuto alla sua sinistra e già stirato, era blu a tinta unita, se non fosse per la bocca delle maniche, i gomiti e le spalle, che invece erano neri. I colori della bandiera di Aedostul venivano riutilizzati in ogni modo possibile - pensò Dylan - ed altre uniformi presentavano combinazioni diverse. Con gli stivali militari neri, tornò ad essere l'incursore giurato che era solito essere. Poi, ignorando lo stato in cui era la sua abitazione, ne uscì chiudendo dietro di sé la porta. DYLAN NEAR diceva la targhetta fuori dalla porta, anche se era solo un pezzo di carta stampata, ritagliata e attaccata con biadesivo. Avrebbe voluto aggiungere \\"Incursore\\", ma era proibito dalle regole condominiali. Comunque, già tutti in città sapevano chi era e cosa facesse. \\"Il lavoro chiama?\\" disse una voce di vecchia. Era la signora Yashmil, un'anziana signora con lineamenti antipatici e capelli diradati. Una vicina tranquilla, pensava Dylan, se non fosse stato per il volume della televisione sempre sparato alle stelle. Si limitò ad annuirle. \\"Voi ragazzi state facendo proprio un bel lavoro. Ad averti come vicino, mi sento più tranquilla.\\" Dylan le rivolse un sorriso falso e sforzato. \\"Scientia Perfectio Est\\", disse Dylan. Quello era il motto dei DB, che significava que la conoscenza è perfezione. Era ben consapevole che non c'entrasse nulla, ma gli venne improvvisa voglia di mostrarsi fiero. Colpita e affondata, la signora Yashmil si limitò a osservare Dylan con silente ammirazione. Lui commentò qualcosa, poi scese le scale. Si trovava al nono piano e tutti gli altri usavano l'ascensore. Ma lui voleva tenersi in allenamento. Infine, si trovò nella città. Una città con alti grattacieli e luci digitali sullo sfondo. Alla sua sinistra, due robot curavano le aiuole condominiali; di fronte un asfalto ben piatto di buona qualità. Anche i pali della luce erano in ottime condizioni e illuminavano la strada con una luce bianca intensa. I negozi del piano terra avevano tutti vetrine di plexiglass dove i loro prodotti erano esposti. Alla fine del viale, in una piazzola, un enorme schermo a LED mostrava inserzioni pubblicitarie. Quella era Nordent, una città, come indica il nome, a nord della Nazione, distante qualche chilometro dalla vallata di Iron Mountain."},{"instruction":"人工智能对医学培训带来的弊端","output":"1. 依赖性高：人工智能培训往往是依赖于计算机和其他技术实现的，如果出现故障或技术问题，医学生就会受到影响。 2. 建立在数据上：人工智能培训有很多是基于数据的，这就需要有足够的数据量和质量。但是，在一些偏远地区和医疗机构中，数据可能有限，这就限制了医学生的培训能力。 3. 缺乏人情味：医生需要具备良好的沟通技巧和同情心，而人工智能教育可能无法提供这方面的培训。 4. 忽略个性化需求：人工智能教育通常都是非个性化的，这可能无法充分满足每个医学生的需求和能力水平。 5. 无法全面了解学生：人工智能无法与医学生进行面对面的交流，无法了解他们的才能和弱点。 6. 缺乏现场体验：医学生需要进行现场实习和临床培训，这样才能更好地理解医学知识和技巧。人工智能教育无法提供现场体验。"},{"instruction":"Напиши характеристики 1987 john deere amt 600","output":"К сожалению, я не могу предоставить характеристики 1987 John Deere AMT 600, так как не обладаю информацией об этой модели.

Para evitar que la cerradura se atasque, aplica aceite para lubricarla cada cierto tiempo.</li> <li>Limpia el capó: es muy importante que limpies el capó de vez en cuando, para evitar la acumulación de suciedad y escombros que puedan dañarlo con el tiempo. Limpiarlo también hará que se vea más atractivo y nuevo por mas tiempo. </li> <li>Inspecciona el capó y su junta para detectar signos de deterioro o daños: es importante que lleves un seguimiento periódico de la salud del capó, y para ello, basta con observarlo, comprobar su ajuste, observar si las juntas lucen estables o tracción de las deformaciones mencionadas. Por si acaso, es importante que un mecánico profesional revise tu automóvil por su motor y otros detalles del coche de una forma mucho más profunda.</li> <li>Reemplaza las piezas dañadas: por último, si notas alguna evidencia de que la junta o alguna otra pieza estén desgastadas, reemplaza estas partes de inmediato. Por ejemplo, cambiar una bisagra puede parecer insignificante, pero puede marcar una gran diferencia en la seguridad y la protección de tu motor. </li> </ul> <h2>Palabras clave de SEO</h2> <p>Las keywords son las palabras clave que lo ayudan a que su sitio web sea más visible en los motores de búsqueda, por eso es importante mencionar en este artículo varios de los términos que están relacionados con el tema principal, como:</p> <ul> <li>Capó del coche</li> <li>Mantenimiento del coche</li> <li>Riesgos de seguridad del coche</li> <li>Daños en el capó del coche</li> </ul> <p>Mencionar estas palabras clave en el artículo, con una buena redacción, ayudará a mejorar su posicionamiento en los motores de búsqueda y a conectar con lectores que buscan información relevante sobre estos temas.
