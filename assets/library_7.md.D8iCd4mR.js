Answer the following question: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Doctor Seuss was born in 1904. By the middle 1950s, he had become one of the best-loved and most successful children's book writers in the world. His books are very popular with young readers. They enjoy the invented words and the pictures of unusual funny animals and plants. In 1954, life magazine published a report about school children who could not read. The report said many children's books were not interesting. Doctor Seuss strongly hoped to help children and decided to write books that were interesting and easy to read. He used words with the same ending sound, like fish and wish. He did not receive training in art. Yet, he drew the pictures for most of his books. In 1957, Dr. Seuss wrote The Cat in the Hat. He used less than 230 words to write the book and even a six-year-old should be able to read it. It was a fun story and easy to read. Children loved it. Their parents loved it, too. Today it is still one of the stories they like best. The success of The Cat in the Hat made him want to write more books for children. In 1960, he wrote a book using less than fifty words. The book is called Green Eggs and Ham. In 1984, Doctor Seuss won a Pulitzer Prize  . He was honored for the education and enjoyment his books provided American children and their parents. He died at the age of 87, but his influence remains. Millions of his books have been sold worldwide. People say his books helped change the way American children learned to read. Yet, his books are loved by people of all ages. Doctor Seuss once said, \\"I do not write for children. I write for people.\\" Question: People like his books because the books   _  .

Add spaces: Settinguptwo-factorauthenticationonOffice365","output":"Setting up two-factor authentication on Office 365 Two-factor authentication (2FA) is a vital security feature that adds an extra layer of protection to your Office 365 account. By requiring two different types of identification before granting access, 2FA makes it more difficult for hackers to compromise your account even if they have your password. In this guide, we'll walk you through the process of setting up 2FA for your Office 365 account step by step. 1. Sign in to your Office 365 account: First, go to the Office 365 website (https://www.office.com/) and sign in with your account credentials (email address and password). 2. Access the Security and Privacy settings: Once logged in, click on your profile picture or initials in the top right corner of the screen. From the dropdown menu, select \\"My Account.\\" In the My Account page, navigate to the \\"Security and Privacy\\" tab. 3. Enable two-factor authentication: Under the \\"Security and Privacy\\" tab, select \\"Additional security verification.\\" Then click on \\"Set up two-factor authentication\\" or \\"Update your settings.\\" This will take you to the 2FA setup page. 4. Choose your preferred verification method: Office 365 offers several verification methods for 2FA, including phone calls, text messages, and authenticator apps. Select the method you prefer, and follow the on-screen instructions to set it up. For example, if you choose to use an authenticator app like Google Authenticator or Microsoft Authenticator, you'll need to download the app to your smartphone and scan a QR code provided by Office 365 during the setup process. 5. Complete the setup process: After configuring your preferred verification method, Office 365 will ask you to verify your chosen method. Complete the verification process by following the on-screen instructions. This may involve entering a code sent to your phone, scanning a QR code with your authenticator app, or answering a phone call. 6. Generate app passwords (optional): Some older or third-party apps may not support 2FA. In these cases, you'll need to create an app-specific password to use in place of your regular account password. To create an app password, go to the \\"Additional security verification\\" page and click \\"Create and manage app passwords.\\" Follow the prompts to create, label, and generate an app-specific password. Use this password when required by the application. 7. Verify your email or phone number (optional): Office 365 may also prompt you to add or confirm secondary contact information, such as an alternate email address or phone number. This can be useful for account recovery purposes if you ever lose access to your primary email or phone. Follow the on-screen instructions to add or verify this information. 8. Update your Office applications (recommended): To ensure seamless integration with 2FA, it's a good idea to update your Office applications to the latest versions. These updates typically include support for newer security features and improvements. 9. Test your two-factor authentication: To ensure 2FA is working as intended, sign out of your Office 365 account and sign back in using your updated security settings. You should be prompted for a second verification factor after entering your password. By following these steps, you have successfully set up two-factor authentication for your Office 365 account. This added layer of security will help protect your valuable data, emails, and personal information from potential threats."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Answer the following question: Two brothers went to the doctor for their yearly examination. Liam found out he has high cholesterol, while Rudy found out his triglycerides and cholesterol are within normal parameters.  Which brother was more at risk for heart disease?  Hint: Cholesterol has been implicated in heart disease for decades. Atherosclerosis is a disorder of the arteries in which cholesterol and other materials are deposited on the interior of the arterial wall. These deposits lead to the formation of plaques that can restrict or even block the flow of blood through these blood vessels (see Figure below ). A decrease in the flow of blood can lead to high blood pressure and a lowered oxygen supply to the heart muscle. A complete blockage of blood flow to parts of the heart (a heart attack) can cause significant damage due to oxygen deprivation, in some cases leading to death. Answer:","output":"Based on the information given and the hint, Liam, the brother with high cholesterol, is more at risk for heart disease due to the association of high cholesterol levels with atherosclerosis and potential blockage of blood flow."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Sir Henry Irving (6 February 1838 - 13 October 1905), born John Henry Brodribb, sometimes known as J. H. Irving, was an English stage actor in the Victorian era, known as an actor-manager because he took complete responsibility (supervision of sets, lighting, direction, casting, as well as playing the leading roles) for season after season at the Lyceum Theatre, establishing himself and his company as representative of English classical theatre. In 1895 he became the first actor to be awarded a knighthood, indicating full acceptance into the higher circles of British society. Irving is widely acknowledged to be one of the inspirations for Count Dracula, the title character of the 1897 novel Dracula whose author, Bram Stoker, was business manager of the theatre. After a few years' schooling while living at Halsetown, near St Ives, Cornwall, Irving became a clerk to a firm of East India merchants in London, but he soon gave up a commercial career for acting. On 29 September 1856 he made his first appearance at Sunderland as Gaston, Duke of Orleans, in Bulwer Lytton's play, Richelieu, billed as Henry Irving. This name he eventually assumed by royal licence. When the inexperienced Irving got stage fright and was hissed off the stage the actor Samuel Johnson was among those who supported him with practical advice. Later in life Irving gave them all regular work when he formed his own Company at the Lyceum Theatre.  For 10 years, he went through an arduous training in various stock companies in Scotland and the north of England, taking more than 500 parts.  his delineations of the various characters (...) were admirably graphic, and met with repeated rounds of applause. Possesed of a fine voice, which he modulated with great taste and judgment, he was able to mark the depth or frivolity of the character he was representing with remarkable facility.  He gained recognition by degrees, and in 1866 Ruth Herbert engaged him as her leading man and sometime stage director at the St. James's Theatre, London, where she first played Doricourt in The Belle's Stratagem. One piece that he directed there was W. S. Gilbert's first successful solo play, Dulcamara, or the Little Duck and the Great Quack (1866) The next year he joined the company of the newly opened Queen's Theatre, where he acted with Charles Wyndham, J. L. Toole, Lionel Brough, John Clayton, Mr. and Mrs. Alfred Wigan, Ellen Terry and Nellie Farren. This was followed by short engagements at the Haymarket Theatre, Drury Lane, and the Gaiety Theatre. Finally he made his first conspicuous success as Digby Grant in James Albery's Two Roses, which was produced at the Vaudeville Theatre on 4 June 1870 and ran for a very successful 300 nights.  In 1871, Irving began his association with the Lyceum Theatre by an engagement under Bateman's management. The fortunes of the house were at a low ebb when the tide was turned by Irving's sudden success as Mathias in The Bells, a version of Erckmann-Chatrian's Le Juif polonais by Leopold Lewis, a property which Irving had found for himself. The play ran for 150 nights, established Irving at the forefront of the British drama, and would prove a popular vehicle for Irving for the rest of his professional life. With Bateman, Irving was seen in W. G. Wills' Charles I and Eugene Aram, in Richelieu, and in 1874 in Hamlet. The unconventionality of this last performance, during a run of 200 nights, aroused keen discussion and singled him out as the most interesting English actor of his day. In 1875, again with Bateman, he was seen as the title character in Macbeth; in 1876 as Othello, and as Philip in Alfred Lord Tennyson's Queen Mary; in 1877 in Richard III; and in The Lyons Mail. During this time he became lifelong friends with Bram Stoker, who praised him in his review of Hamlet and thereafter joined Irving as the manager for the company.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: What is an example of a job Henry Irving held early in his career?","output":"An example of a job Henry Irving held early in his career is when he \\"became a clerk to a firm of East India merchants in London.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

By the middle 1950s, he had become one of the best-loved and most successful children's book writers in the world. His books are very popular with young readers. They enjoy the invented words and the pictures of unusual funny animals and plants. In 1954, life magazine published a report about school children who could not read. The report said many children's books were not interesting. Doctor Seuss strongly hoped to help children and decided to write books that were interesting and easy to read. He used words with the same ending sound, like fish and wish. He did not receive training in art. Yet, he drew the pictures for most of his books. In 1957, Dr. Seuss wrote The Cat in the Hat. He used less than 230 words to write the book and even a six-year-old should be able to read it. It was a fun story and easy to read. Children loved it. Their parents loved it, too. Today it is still one of the stories they like best. The success of The Cat in the Hat made him want to write more books for children. In 1960, he wrote a book using less than fifty words. The book is called Green Eggs and Ham. In 1984, Doctor Seuss won a Pulitzer Prize  . He was honored for the education and enjoyment his books provided American children and their parents. He died at the age of 87, but his influence remains. Millions of his books have been sold worldwide. People say his books helped change the way American children learned to read.

Given the question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the full name of the mother of the girl that the professor of French Literature is attracted to? ?  In 1947, Humbert Humbert, a middle-aged European professor of French literature, travels to the United States to take a teaching position in New Hampshire. He rents a room in the home of widow Charlotte Haze, largely because he is romantically attracted to her adolescent daughter Dolores, also called \\"Lo\\", who he sees while touring the house. Obsessed from boyhood with girls of approximately her age (whom he calls \\"nymphets\\"), Humbert is immediately smitten with Lo and gets married to Charlotte only just to be near her daughter. Charlotte finds Humbert's secret diary and discovers his preference for her daughter. Furious, Charlotte runs out of the house, when she is struck by a car and killed.  Her death frees Humbert to pursue a romantic and sexual relationship with Lo, whom he nicknames \\"Lolita\\". Humbert and Lo then travel the country, staying in various motels before eventually settling in the college town of Beardsley, where Humbert takes a teaching job and Lo begins attending an all-girls Catholic school. However, Lo's increasing boredom with Humbert, combined with her growing desire for independence, fuels a constant tension that lead to a fight between them. Humbert's affection for Lo is also rivaled by another man, playwright Clare Quilty, who has been pursuing Lo since the beginning of the pair's travels. Lo eventually escapes with Quilty, and Humbert's search for them is unsuccessful, especially as he doesn't know Quilty's name. Three years later, Humbert receives a letter from Lo asking for money. Humbert visits Lo, who is now married and pregnant. Humbert asks her to run away with him, but she refuses. He relents and gives her a substantial amount of money. Lo also reveals to Humbert how Quilty actually tracked young girls and took them to Pavor Manor, his home in Parkington, to exploit them for child pornography. Quilty abandoned her after she refused to be in one of his films. The answer is:","output":"Charlotte Haze."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Translate this to English?","output":"Aggressive behaviors that can be seen in some television programs have a negative psychological effect on children. This statement brings attention to the potential impact of television content on children's mental health and well-being. Aggressive behaviors depicted in various television programs, such as violence, confrontations, and negative communication, may influence children's behavior and psychological development in different ways. Firstly, children's repeated exposure to aggressive behavior on television may desensitize them to violence, making it seem more acceptable and normal in their everyday lives. Consequently, they may become more likely to engage in violent actions or adopt aggressive communication styles with their peers and family members. Secondly, watching aggressive behaviors on television may lead to a distorted perception of reality. Children may develop an inaccurate understanding of social norms and fail to recognize appropriate ways to resolve conflicts or express emotions effectively. This can result in forming unhealthy relationships, engaging in inappropriate behaviors, and struggling in social situations. Thirdly, the continuous exposure to violent content may increase children's anxiety and fear levels. Psychological studies have demonstrated that children who watch violent television shows are more prone to nightmares, diminished self-confidence, and heightened anxiety. Such persistent emotional distress may significantly impede their emotional and mental development as they grow. Moreover, the portrayal of aggression in television programs may contribute to the development of aggressive attitudes or stereotypes. Children who watch these programs may start to categorize individuals based on the violent tendencies they observe on screen, leading to judgmental attitudes or prejudices. In turn, this could foster a hostile environment, isolating children and negatively affecting their potential for personal growth and fostering a broader social awareness. Lastly, children who frequently watch aggressive behavior on television may miss out on opportunities to develop essential social and emotional skills. Their screen time might overshadow more positive experiences, such as engaging in creative play, spending quality time with family and friends, or participating in extracurricular activities that promote cognitive, emotional, and social growth. In conclusion, aggressive behaviors portrayed in television programs may have a detrimental psychological effect on children. It is vital for parents, caregivers, and educators to monitor and limit children's exposure to such content, as well as encourage the consumption of age-appropriate, educational, and positively stimulating media. This approach will not only mitigate the potential harm caused by aggressive television content but also promote healthy psychological and emotional development in children."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The result was a second consecutive victory for Constantine Karamanlis and his National Radical Union party , which won 171 of the 300 seats in Parliament .  - Athens (\\"Athína\\" ) is the capital and largest city of Greece. Athens dominates the Attica region and is one of the world's oldest cities, with its recorded history spanning over 3,400 years, and its earliest human presence starting somewhere between the 11th and 7th millennia BC. Classical Athens was a powerful city-state that emerged in conjunction with the seagoing development of the port of Piraeus, which had been a distinct city prior to its 5th century BC incorporation with Athens. A centre for the arts, learning and philosophy, home of Plato's Academy and Aristotle's Lyceum, it is widely referred to as the cradle of Western civilization and the birthplace of democracy, largely because of its cultural and political impact on the European continent, and in particular the Romans. In modern times, Athens is a large cosmopolitan metropolis and central to economic, financial, industrial, maritime, political and cultural life in Greece. In 2015, Athens was ranked the world's 29th richest city by purchasing power and the 67th most expensive in a UBS study.  - The National Radical Union ((), \\"Ethnik Rizospastik Énsis\\" (ERE)) was a Greek political party formed in 1955 by Konstantinos Karamanlis, mostly out of the Greek Rally party.  - Greece (' ), officially the Hellenic Republic (Greek: ' ), historically also known as Hellas (\\"\\" ), is a country in southeastern Europe.  Greece's population is approximately 10.955 million as of 2015. Athens is the nation's capital and largest city, followed by Thessaloniki.  - Greek Rally ((), \\"Ellnikòs Synagermós (ES)\\") was a right-wing political party in Greece. Founded on 6 August 1951 by former field marshal Alexandros Papagos, the party encompassed a broad spectrum of the royalist conservative elements in Greek society and was modelled on the Charles de Gaulle's Rassemblement du Peuple Français (RPF). Throughout the years, the Greek right had become splintered. Papagos' new party managed to attract considerable support, and the Populist Uniting Party (led by Panagiotis Kanellopoulos and Stephanos Stephanopoulos) and the New Party (led by Spiros Markezinis) dissolved and merged with the Greek Rally. Later on, a large portion of the People's Party, the major right-wing party of the prewar era, defected to the Greek Rally; among the prominent defectors was Konstantinos Karamanlis.

Process: - A bird lays an egg - The egg hatches into a baby bird - Baby bird eats - Grows into an adult bird - The bird finds a mate - The pair build a nest - The birds lay eggs.  Question: suppose there is very little human interference happens, how will it affect fewer eggs hatch.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","output":"Given the process provided, the second effect mentioned is \\"The egg hatches into a baby bird.\\"  Now let's analyze the situation: Very little human interference happens, which could potentially lead to fewer eggs hatching. 1. \\"A bird lays an egg\\": With very little human interference, it is likely that there is no change or a positive effect on this stage. There might be more suitable habitats and fewer disturbances for the birds to lay eggs. 2. \\"The egg hatches into a baby bird\\": Since there is very little human interference, it is possible that the environment is better suited for the eggs and the hatching process; however, fewer eggs hatch could suggest natural factors such as predation or environmental conditions have a greater effect. Nonetheless, human interference plays a minor role, and any perturbation might have less effect on this process. 3. \\"Baby bird eats\\": With little human interference, it is likely that the food sources for the baby birds are also less affected, which might lead to the birds having enough food and possibly less competition. As a result, this stage might see more or less the same effects as the previous two steps. 4. \\"Grows into an adult bird\\": The growth of the baby bird could be influenced by the previous steps and the environment. As very little human interference means minimal disturbances, it is expected that the baby bird's growth could be reasonably suitable for its natural environment, leading to more or less the same effects as the previous steps. 5. \\"The bird finds a mate\\": Minimal human interference may result in a healthier bird population, which subsequently could lead to higher chances of finding a mate. As a result, the birds may have a larger pool of potential mates, leading to more or less the same effects as the previous steps. 6. \\"The pair build a nest\\": If there is very little human interference, it means there could be more favorable conditions for nest-building in the form of more suitable habitats and fewer disturbances. The birds should have no problem in building a nest, leading to more or less the same effects as the previous steps. 7. \\"The birds lay eggs\\": With minimal human interference, the birds can enjoy a generally healthy environment and potentially produce more eggs in the future. This step's effects may also be more or less the same as the previous steps. Considering the entire process and the influence of very little human interference, I would say that it has less effect on the second effect mentioned, which is \\"The egg hatches into a baby bird.\\" It is worth mentioning that natural factors will still play a significant role in determining the overall success of the processes described."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is this text about?","output":"This text, dated October 27, reports the views of then French President Jacques Chirac on Turkey's attempt to join the European Union, often abbreviated as the EU. To expound, the EU is a political and economic union of 27 member states that are primarily located in Europe, characterized by the abolition of border control between member states, a common market, and policies that ensure the free movement of goods, services, capital, and labor. In this text, President Jacques Chirac explicitly states that Turkey's bid to become a member of this union was \\"not a done deal,\\" essentially highlighting the uncertainty and unpredictability of the accession process. The statement seems to temper enthusiasm or reductionist views that Turkey's accession to the EU was guaranteed or inevitable, underscoring that there could be possible obstacles or disagreements that might affect the actualization of this membership. However, Chirac also expresses his belief that it was in Europe's best interests for Turkey to join the EU. This statement assumes significance as it posits that Turkey's accession could potentially bring strategic, economic, or geopolitical benefits to Europe. Although Chirac doesn't clearly delineate what these potential benefits could be, one might infer that they might pertain to strengthening regional security, boosting economic growth, fostering diplomatic relations, among other beneficial outcomes.  The views stated by Chirac were reported by a government spokesman after a cabinet meeting. This setting and method of delivery underline the importance of the issues being discussed, where decisions and viewpoints potentially have broad and far-reaching consequences on international relations and regional dynamics. To wrap up, this text is centered on Turkey's bid for EU membership as seen from the perspective of the then French President Jacques Chirac. It shines a light on the intricacies of international politics, where decisions are rarely easy or straightforward, and the potential benefits and uncertainties that come with nations seeking new partnerships and memberships."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Singer Chris Brown, sought by Los Angeles police after an alleged domestic violence incident, turned himself in Sunday, police said. Chris Brown attends a party saluting music producer Clive Davis in Beverly Hills, California, on Saturday. Brown, nominated for two Grammy Awards, was a no-show Sunday night at the nationally televised awards show. He was scheduled to perform at the show. His girlfriend, singer Rihanna, abruptly canceled her planned Grammys performance, but neither her spokesman nor the show organizers gave a reason. \\"Rihanna is well,\\" her spokesman said in a written statement. \\"Thank you for concern and support.\\" Police have not identified the alleged victim, who they said \\"suffered visible injuries and identified","output":"Brown as her attacker.\\" The incident took place early Sunday morning in the Hancock Park neighborhood of Los Angeles. Both Brown and the alleged victim attended Clive Davis' pre-Grammy party on Saturday night before the incident occurred. Brown was taken into custody on suspicion of making criminal threats, a felony, and later released on a 50,000 bail. The Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office said they needed more time to review the case and gather additional evidence before deciding whether to file formal charges against Brown. Rihanna's representatives have not confirmed or denied if she is the unidentified victim in the case. However, sources close to the couple have claimed that Rihanna was indeed the victim of the alleged assault. As the case unfolds, both Brown and Rihanna's careers have come under scrutiny, with many fans and industry insiders expressing concern for their safety and well-being. While some have called for Brown to be stripped of his Grammy nominations, others argue that the incident should be treated as a private matter between the two artists. Advocacy groups have also seized on the case as an opportunity to raise awareness about domestic violence and the importance of getting help for both victims and perpetrators. Domestic violence hotlines have reported an uptick in calls following news of the alleged altercation, though it is unclear if the increase can be directly attributed to the high-profile case. The Recording Academy, the organization responsible for the Grammy Awards, issued a statement expressing its disappointment on the situation. \\"We hope that this matter can be resolved swiftly and fairly, and that both Chris Brown and Rihanna can resume their careers and continue to inspire fans around the world,\\" the statement read. As the story continues to develop, it is expected that more details about the alleged altercation will emerge, shedding light on the events leading up to the arrest and the nature of the alleged victim's injuries. Additionally, legal experts suggest that if charges are pressed against Brown, he could potentially face jail time, depending on the severity of the allegations and any previous criminal history. Both Chris Brown and Rihanna have remained largely silent about the incident, with their representatives urging respect for the artists' privacy during this difficult time. As fans and the music industry await further developments in this case, it is clear that the outcome of this story will have lasting effects on the lives and careers of these two talented musicians."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In 2014, Newsom was the only statewide politician to endorse California Proposition 47, a piece of legislation that decriminalized nonviolent offenses like drug and property crimes, turning them into misdemeanors as opposed to felonies.  In July 2015, Newsom released the final report of the Blue Ribbon Commission on Marijuana Policy, which he had convened with the American Civil Liberties Union of California in 2013. The report's recommendations to regulate marijuana were intended to inform a legalization measure on the November 2016 ballot. Newsom supported the resulting measure, Proposition 64, which legalized cannabis use and cultivation for California state residents who are 21 or older.  In response to pro-enforcement statements made by Press Secretary Sean Spicer, Newsom sent a letter on February 24, 2017, to Attorney General Sessions and President Trump, urging them not to increase federal enforcement against recreational cannabis firms opening up in California. He wrote, \\"The government must not strip the legal and publicly supported industry of its business and hand it back to drug cartels and criminals ... Dealers don't card kids. I urge you and your administration to work in partnership with California and the other eight states that have legalized recreational marijuana for adult use in a way that will let us enforce our state laws that protect the public and our children, while targeting the bad actors.\\" Newsom responded to comments by Spicer which compared cannabis to opioids saying, \\"Unlike marijuana, opioids represent an addictive and harmful substance, and I would welcome your administration's focused efforts on tackling this particular public health crisis.\\" Ask a question about this article.","output":"What was the purpose of the Blue Ribbon Commission on Marijuana Policy that Gavin Newsom convened with the American Civil Liberties Union of California in 2013?"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: But many of its facts, while delightful, aren't actually factual, something noted by a BuzzFeed reporter in a tweet last December.      With more than 6 million followers since its inception in 2011, UberFacts is one of the most widely followed accounts on Twitter. On Facebook, UberFacts' page has more than 283,000 likes. It even has its own website.      Not really true but it makes a good Tweet I guess. RT @UberFacts: Apple now has more cash on hand than the U.S. government.      Not really true but it makes a good Tweet I guess. RT @UberFacts: Apple now has more cash on hand than the U.S. government.      When UberFacts was pressed over Twitter about the prevalence of false information coming from the account, BuzzFeed received an apparent response from Kris Sanchez, the founder of UberFacts. In December, he emailed to suggest unfollowing the UberFacts Twitter page instead of complaining about the validity of the facts. (Sanchez more recently denied sending the email, and suggested his email was hacked.)      The tweets about Apple now read , \\"for a brief period of time in 2011, Apple had more money than the U.S. government.\\"      In this case, this fact was briefly true, during the debt ceiling debate in July of 2011, but UberFacts recycled the tweet numerous times , tweeting it on Feb. 6, 2012, Feb. 12, 2012, March 3, 2012, March 13, 2012, May 8, 2012, and June 19, 2012, as well as tweets in August 2012 and December 2012.      This week, after more criticism, Sanchez denied the correspondence. He tweeted publicly that the suggestion that he had sent the email is fabricated and \\"ridiculous.\\"      I'm flattered that a writer from a well known website would make up such a ridiculous story. Don't understand it, but still flattered!      I'm flattered that a writer from a well known website would make up such a ridiculous story. Don't understand it, but still flattered!

Because they don't exist :)      For the record: I don't and never have sent emails to people who don't like me or my page... Because they don't exist :)      The email came from \\"kris@uber-facts.com,\\" the email he told BuzzFeed he uses. It's the same email Sanchez listed when he filed to trademark the term \\"UberFacts\\" in February 2012.      \\"I never sent you an email,\\" Sanchez told BuzzFeed. \\"It is my email address but my email has been compromised in the past. So that's not the address that I actively use.\\"      When asked if his email had been hacked, Sanchez said he'd been a victim of hacking before.      \\"I've been a victim and a target of that before. That's the only explanation. I'm not suggesting you made it up. I can tell you definitively that I never sent you an email...it happens; it comes with the territory.\\"      In a \\"frequently asked questions\\" section of his site from March 2013,      Sanchez says he sometimes cites sources but rarely ever does it on the UberFacts Twitter page, explaining people don't like to see links in tweets.      2) Do you ever cite your sources?            Yes! But not all of them, and rarely ever on the Twitter page. Sources can be found here on the website below articles. As far as tweets go, it's much more time efficient for one to simply use the Google machine to find the answers to whatever questions you may have! Believe it or not, more people would prefer NOT to see a link at the end of the tweet.      Sanchez has also said in the past he fact-checks all of his facts before posting them.      \\"Any fact that is submitted that I do consider using is always verified before it's posted,\\" Sanchez said in an interview in April 2012.      But Sanchez's errors sometimes draw anger from some of the account's 6 million-plus followers.      A tweet in October about a Florida man who complained about a headache only to realize at the hospital his wife had accidentally shot him used an image from a story about a Chinese woman who had a bullet removed from her brain.      When asked about the discrepancy on Twitter, Sanchez tweeted, \\"the image is not the fact.\\"      Sanchez said he doesn't create the images himself, noting that he pulls them from different sites and puts them in a file format he has for tweeting images.      \\"None of those images are created by me,\\" Sanchez said.      Sanchez told BuzzFeed that the majority of the facts he finds are culled from a variety of sources as well as a smaller percentage of facts that people submit. He says he fact-checks them all.      \\"I would say 96–97% of the facts you see on the Twitter account are facts I found on science articles, Google alerts, new studies, anything like that,\\" he said. \\"The other 3–4% are facts which people have submitted, which I will then look up before posting. Anything I post I honestly believe to be true, and when I find out otherwise I remove it as quickly as I can.\\"      When asked about some of the tweets that are believed to be incorrect, Sanchez said, \\"anything that I post up there [I] truly believe to be true. I'm not trying to lie to anyone. When I do find out that things are incorrect. I will either correct them or will remove them.\\"      Sanchez says he handles corrections by posting a new fact and tweeting the correction at UberFacts' Twitter account.      \\"I'll tweet the new fact out,\\" Sanchez said, citing a correction from Monday. \\"There was a photo of the Titanic, the story of the guy who survived the sinking of the America and then died on the Titanic and I had messed up the year. So I retweeted the fact again with the proper year and mentioned the UberFacts account from UberFacts with the correction.\\" ||||| Kris Sanchez is tapping furiously on the screen of his iPhone 6.      \\"It gets harder\\"—-tap, tap, tap—\\"and harder as you go,\\" he says, staring intently at the sleek appliance. \\"You have\\"—tap, tap, tap—\\"less time.\\"      Kris Sanchez      It’s a blindingly sunny morning in October, and Sanchez, founder of the uber-popular Twitter account UberFacts, is sitting outside at a sidewalk cafe in Beverly Hills showing me a feature on the about-to-be-released UberFacts Android app. (An iOS app already exists.) He's playing a game called UberTap, in which you try to tap the screen a certain number of times within a certain number of seconds. Say, 80 times in 10 seconds. It’s mindlessly addictive (wait—what about 100 times in 10 seconds?), and has absolutely nothing to do with the weird, Ripley's Believe It Or Not-type trivia that has made UberFacts one of the most powerful brands on Twitter.      \\"I really want to give people a variety of things to do,\\" Sanchez says, pushing up the sleeves on his dark green leather jacket to reveal a small tattoo on his wrist that says \\"wealth and prosperity\\" in Chinese characters (the other wrist says \\"love\\" also in Chinese characters). The 23-year-old former dancer—he studied theater in high school and was among the hundreds of dancers who performed at the Microsoft Kinect launch in 2010 in Times Square—is wearing jeans and purple high-tops. His dark hair is cut in a thick Mohawk, the tips bleached the color of burnt caramel. \\"I want people to be able to do more than just read facts all day long.\\"      Of course, the greater public's love of doing just that is what has made Sanchez one of the top 100 influencers on Twitter, as well as one of the richest. By spewing out tens of thousands of the most \\"unimportant things you’ll never need to know,\\" as the UberFacts Twitter page cheekily pronounces, Sanchez has accumulated over 7 million followers since launching the account in 2009 when he was a bored college student at SUNY New Paltz. (\\"Total hippie town, drum circles. I only went there for a year.\\")      It was really the first time I was really publicly attacked on the Internet. After that I was like, okay, UberFacts needs to be treated like a real brand.      Today he says he makes about 500,000 a year just from sponsored links. The way this works is that a company called Social Reactor, which pairs social media influencers with advertisers, supplies him with galleries or other web pages that he links to in his Tweets. He gets paid for every click those pages receive. Then there are the branded deals he’s done with companies like Ford and Paramount, wherein a simple tweet, accompanied by a link and a hashtag, becomes a virtual slot machine, gushing out thousands to tens of thousands of dollars. Plus the apps. The iOS app, which has been downloaded 1.5 million times, is estimated to generate 60,000 a week from advertising, though that has not yet been implemented.      Sanchez is a \\"special breed,\\" according to Scott Jones, the CEO of ChaCha, which owns Social Reactor. \\"It’s pretty rare to make that much [money],\\" Jones says.      The reason Sanchez is \\"on the upper end of the pay scale,\\" Jones says, is \\"partially because he has a big follower base, but more importantly, his audience is highly engaged. They stay for an average of more than 14 page views a visit. So if it's a gallery of 10 images, they're going to look at the 10 and then four (pages) of something else.\\"      In a lot of ways, Sanchez is a personification of the kind of you’re-never-gonna-believe-this facts that his Twitter feed churns out. A twentysomething college dropout can make more money on Twitter than a corporate executive. But his tale is also revealing of the often tumultuous, sometimes painful, way that young, talented, creative, and very green new media mavens are forced to grow up in the fast-paced, self-regulating world of the Internet. It’s a place where entrepreneurs with bold ideas and Red Bull-fueled energy reserves can carve out insanely lucrative jobs and identities overnight, often without realizing that what they’re doing is actually a job, and usually without any real training.      Some UberFacts \\"facts\\" | Click to expand      In Sanchez’s case, until just recently, he thought of UberFacts as \\"a hobby.\\" It was one that he started in college when, instead of studying, \\"I decided to kill time by searching for facts on the Internet.\\"      Oh, and there was another reason, too.      \\"I also joined Twitter to follow Britney Spears\\" he says. \\"But I didn't have anything to tweet about. So I figured, hey, tweeting these facts would be a really good idea. It was just so I could feel like I was closer to her.\\"      Alas, Britney didn't follow him back (and still hasn't), but Sanchez had found his calling. After dropping out of SUNY, he moved back to Brooklyn, his hometown, and, in between dance auditions and a job as an after-school counselor that paid 250 a week, he tweeted. Like many Internet pioneers, he worked out of an apartment, rolling out bed in the morning and sitting down in front of his computer before heading off to his real job as a counselor. Sharp, intuitive, and a very quick-study, it was not long before he figured out that generating more of the right kind of tweets at the right times of day resulted in more followers, and so he ramped up to 60 to 70 tweets a day. He also spent 1,000 on retweets and shout-outs from other influencers (now a Twitter no-no), and his account started taking off.      But for a one-man operation, the schedule was challenging, he says, and earlier this year he was called out by BuzzFeed and Gizmodo for posting a number of untrue, or, in some cases, untrue-ish, facts. (One of the latter had to do with a Huggies diaper that sends out a tweet when a baby pees; Sanchez maintains that a prototype of the diaper was made, even if it didn’t actually hit the market.)      \\"There are so many tweets going out each day that it was tough for one person, being me, to make sure that every single one of them was completely true,\\" he says, adding, \\"Anything that I posted up there, I thought was true. And I'm always bummed to find out that it isn't.\\"      Sanchez is visibly still hurt by the incident—which he calls \\"my first public mess\\"—though he's eager to talk about it, perhaps because it wound up prompting a major maturation in himself and his company.      \\"It was really the first time I was really publicly attacked on the Internet. And, you know, BuzzFeed is a really popular website. And it was Lindsay Lohan’s face and my face on their front page. It was after that that I was like, okay, UberFacts needs to be treated like a real brand. It has a large following and I want to put more work in it and make it better. I just want to increase the quality of it.\\"      Some UberFacts \\"facts\\" | Click to expand      Last January he moved from New York to L.A. and got serious. He made himself CEO of UberFacts and brought on two business partners (who, in the startup tradition, are also his best friends and roommates), in addition to a small staff of fact-finders whose sole job is to comb through reports, websites, and various publications looking for the kind of quirkily stupefying factoids that are likely to generate clicks. He then goes over their suggestions and selects which ones will be posted.      When I ask where he and his staff find most of their ideas for tweets, he says \\"BuzzFeed, ironically enough,\\" as well as Reddit and Digg. \\"On Reddit, a lot of people will find an article then write about the article they found. So I'll click on the article and see what else there is,\\" he says.      Even though he's not always culling from The New Yorker or other rigorously fact-checked sources, Sanchez says he stresses the importance of fact-checking to his staff, and that after one employee came up with a series of tweets about pandas that, after being posted, were discovered to have been taken from a book about made-up facts about pandas, the person was let go.      \\"That was the fourth employee,\\" he says. \\"Now there are three.\\"      Many of UberFacts' tweets are actually pretty soft, noncontroversial facts, particularly the gallery links that earn him so much dough. (\\"15 foods that can boost your sex drive!\\") Still, there are the occasional tweets that rely on the conventional wisdom of the Internet and are stripped of nuance for the sake of sensationalism. For instance, this one: \\"Drug Lord Pablo Escobar had so much cash that rats ate nearly one billion dollars of his money each year.\\"      Sanchez cites his source as being the website Elite Daily, which touts itself as the HuffPo for millennials. In a \\"Gangster of the Week\\" compilation of wowza facts about Escobar, the drug lord's brother Roberto is quoted as saying: \\"Pablo was earning so much that each year we would write off 10% of the money because the rats would eat it in storage or it would be damaged by water or lost.\\"      The quote seems to be taken from Roberto's book The Accountant's Story: Inside the Violent World of the Medellín Cartel, and is a little mangled, but the point is that rats alone were not responsible for destroying Escobar's cash.      Sanchez isn't the only one who ran with the partial reading of the line. Rats eating Escobar's billions is a widely circulated meme on the Internet. But it's not the whole truth.

UberFacts might seem like one of those deceptively simple ideas that we all could have thought of, had we been thinking about deceptively simple ideas that would take off on Twitter. But the art of the brand is more than just coming up with oddball trivia and shaving it down to 140 characters. Sanchez has a unique style that is itself deceptively simple, as well as a knack for coming up with facts that walk the line between totally unbelievable and just believable enough. Sample: \\"Blue whales are so big that a human can swim through their largest veins and arteries.\\"      He is also a keen student of how the web works.      Says Jones: \\"Kris only had 200,000 followers when we first met. And in just a matter of a few years, he’s grown that to 7 million. The real trick he pulled off is, he’s tweeting at the right times, and tweeting stuff that resonates. He pays attention to the engagement level of his audience, and he tweets more of the stuff that works and less of the stuff that doesn’t work.\\"      When asked what kind of trivia he likes to push on UberFacts Sanchez says \\"cute animals\\" and \\"those studies that say people who drink more coffee tend to be more open to ideas that contradict their own.      \\"I love stuff like that because it’s just so unexpected. It’s not something that you hear and you say, ‘Oh, I knew that.’ It’s not common sense.\\"      So what’s he planning to do with all his cash? Brand expansion, naturally. Beyond the apps, there’s talk of a book, TV deals and possibly—hey, why not?—a calendar.      Still, he says he will never stop toiling to come up with surprising tweets. \\"Sometimes you have to spend hours going through really mundane pieces of information to find the one that’s magical. But I really enjoy finding those magical ones.\\" ||||| UberFacts UberFacts is available in the app store.      What if you got paid to tweet?

Last year, he made US500,000 for tweeting sponsored links, according to Fast Company. The links, when clicked by his followers, earn him between US.01-.03/click. Multiply that by a few sponsored links a day, a couple of hundred thousand eager followers, and 365 days in the year, and you’re rolling in money.

While the statement \\"A woman figure skater in a blue costume holds her leg in the air by the blade of her skate\\" provides information about the actions and appearance of a woman figure skater, it does not provide enough information to definitively determine whether she is performing in a competition. The action described, which involves holding her leg in the air by the blade of her skate, is likely a part of her figure skating routine, but it could also be a practice session, an exhibition, or a casual performance. Competitions are just one of the many settings where figure skaters perform their routines. They may practice extensively before participating in competitions, perform in exhibitions or ice shows, or engage in casual performances and routines outside of formal events. The fact that the figure skater is wearing a blue costume adds some context, as costumes are generally worn during official performances. However, it is still not enough to confirm if the skater is indeed participating in a competition. To establish whether the figure skater is performing in a competition, additional information would be necessary. Such information might include details about the venue, the presence of an audience or judges, how the performance is scored or ranked, or the nature of any awards or prizes involved.

Uxbridge historically formed part of the parish of Hillingdon in the county of Middlesex, and was a significant local commercial centre from an early time. As part of the suburban growth of London in the 20th century it expanded and increased in population, becoming a municipal borough in 1955, and has formed part of Greater London since 1965. It is a significant retail and commercial centre, and is the location of Brunel University and the Uxbridge campus of Buckinghamshire New University. The town is close to the boundary with Buckinghamshire, which is locally the River Colne.  - Hillingdon is a suburban area within the London Borough of Hillingdon, situated 14.2 miles (22.8 km) west of Charing Cross. It was an ancient parish in the county of Middlesex that originally included the market town of Uxbridge.

The renegades, a group of moderate Republicans, are five signatures short of the 25 needed to bypass leadership and force floor votes on several immigration proposals through a rare procedural tactic known as a discharge petition. Speaker Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican, has described the discharge petition as \\"futile\\" because it lacks any guarantee that a bill would become law in the face of a threatened presidential veto. But it was House conservatives who defeated the 867 million farm bill Friday when their own move to get an immigration bill to the House floor failed. The House Freedom Caucus — a conservative voting bloc in the U.S. House — had offered to vote for the farm bill in exchange for a promise that one immigration bill would be brought up for a vote. The hope was that the offer would be enough to keep some Republican House members from signing the discharge petition. The immigration bill, known as the Goodlatte Bill, is a conservative approach to immigration that would provide legal status to undocumented young people brought to the U.S. as children in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, but only in addition to changes in the U.S. legal immigration system. The Goodlatte Bill is opposed by many moderate Republicans. For them, the deal offered an opportunity to negotiate on legislation that might win the support of President Donald Trump and resolve the status of DACA recipients. The deal fell through, and the farm bill failed to pass by a 193-213 vote Friday. \\"It's not a fatal blow — it's just a reorganize,\\" House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows told reporters shortly after the vote, \\"At this point, we really need to deal with immigration in an effective way.\\" Meadows said House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy negotiated in good faith on the immigration issue, but would not elaborate on why a deal was elusive.

Tea Party groups make gains against 'ObamaCore' education program Tea Party groups are barnstorming state capitals across the country to stop an Obama administration-backed initiative to impose federal math and English education standards on public schools. Though conservatives have long argued that state and local officials can best make decisions on K-12 education, the Tea Party's opposition to the federal program -- Common Core State Standards -- represents a pivot for the movement, which started in 2009 to promote lower taxes and smaller government. And they are making gains, as some states consider putting the program on hold. \\"We have a renewed sense of vigor,\\" Lee Ann Burkholder, founder of the 9/12 Patriots in York, Pa., told FoxNews.com. \\"And when it comes to your kids or grandkids, people really get fired up.\\" The Tea Party is already riled up following revelations that the IRS had been singling out its groups over the past few years. On the education issue, Burkholder said her group held a meeting this spring that attracted 400 people, double the usual number. The meeting was followed by a bus trip to the state capital in which members wore matching T-shirts and pressed their case to lawmakers. Groups have pressured state legislatures and school boards from Michigan to Georgia to drop their support or defund the bipartisan-backed program they've dubbed \\"ObamaCore,\\" putting heat on Republican governors in particular. It's not so much the actual standards they object to but the fact that it's coming from Washington as opposed to the state level, and could lead to tracking student data across the country. Lawmakers, include several seeking reelection, have taken notice, especially after hearing about Tea Party groups vowing to back challengers to those who continue to support Common Core. Seven state legislatures purportedly have proposed legislation to at least delay implementation. And two states with Republican governors -- Indiana and Pennsylvania -- have put the program on hold. In addition, Georgia Republican Gov. Nathan Deal, up for reelection in 2014, issued an executive order last month titled Reaffirming State Sovereignty over Education that in part said: \\"No educational standards shall be imposed on Georgia by the federal government.\\" Deal later told The Washington Post: \\"We didn't see it coming with the intensity that it is, apparently all across the country.\\" Common Core was designed by governors and state education officials with input from teachers and others, with much of its funding coming from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. So far, 45 states and the District of Columbia have adopted the standards, which are scheduled to go into effect next year. The Tea Party effort got a boost when FreedomWorks got involved. The well-funded national group has devoted a variety of resources to raising awareness about the issue, an effort that includes putting several information pages on its website and hosting a national teleconference Wednesday night. \\"Common Core dictates what (teachers) teach, how they teach it and when they teach it,\\" Whitney Neal, a FreedomWorks grassroots organizer, said. \\"Every child is treated the same.\\" However, Common Core states the program only sets standards for math and English language arts, not a national curriculum, and says teachers play a big role. \\"Local teachers, principals, superintendents and others will decide how the standards are to be met,\\" the group says on its website. \\"Teachers will continue to devise lesson plans and tailor instruction to the individual needs of the students in their classrooms.\\" Neal and others suggest states were pigeonholed into accepting the program so they could get much-needed Race to the Top education grants in Obama's 2009 stimulus package. And they are concerned about the gathering of student-assessment data for comparison among students, schools, districts and states. \\"It's very creepy,\\" Neal said. Potential 2016 presidential candidate and former Florida Republican Gov. Jeb Bush has landed in the middle of the controversy. A champion of education reform, including support of home schooling and school vouchers, he has essentially asked lawmakers to resist the Tea Party pressure. \\"The Common Cause State Standards are clear and straight forward,\\" he told business leaders last month in Michigan. \\"Do not pull back. Please do not pull back from high, lofty standards.\\" What was this article about?","output":"This article is about Tea Party groups campaigning against the Common Core State Standards, an Obama administration-backed initiative to impose federal math and English education standards on public schools.

Q:I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Spiderman is one of the most famous comic book heroes of all time. He was created by Stan Lee in 1963 and was first introduced to the world in the pages of Marvel Comic Books. Spiderman's story is the story of Peter Parker, a child who lost his parents and lives with his aunt and uncle. Peter is a shy, quiet boy wearing glasses and has few friends. One day, on a high school class trip to a science lab, he gets bitten by a special spider. Soon Peter realizes he has amazing powers: he is as strong and quick as a spider and also has a type of sixth sense. He no longer needs his glasses and he can use his super power to fly through the city streets! Remembering something his Uncle Ben has told him _ ,Peter decides to use his powers to fight against enemies who do cruel things to people. And so, Spiderman is born. Life is not easy for Peter even though he is a superhero. He is in love with Mary Jane but he can't tell her about his amazing powers. Besides, his best friend Harry hates Spiderman! Peter is also short of money and time. He has to sell photos of Spiderman (himself!) to a newspaper and he keeps losing his other jobs because he's so busy saving people! Yet he has to fight against different kinds of cruel enemies. Question: What does\\"With great power, there must also come great responsibility\\"mean? Options: A: Powerful people can do whatever they like. B: People with power are always good. C: Powerful people should have a responsibility to do good. D: Powerful people are to blame for all the bad things that happen. A:","output":"To answer the question, let's break down the possible answer choices and evaluate them according to the context provided in the article: A: Powerful people can do whatever they like. This option seems to go against the lesson Peter Parker learns from his Uncle Ben. Instead of doing whatever he likes, he decides to use his powers for good and fight against enemies who harm others. This option is not a good representation of the meaning behind the quote. B: People with power are always good. The article does not imply that power automatically makes someone good. It discusses Peter's struggle to balance his life with his newfound powers. Thus, this option does not accurately capture the meaning of \\"with great power, there must also come great responsibility.\\" C: Powerful people should have a responsibility to do good. In the article, after Peter gains his amazing powers, he remembers his Uncle Ben's words and decides to use his abilities to fight against enemies who do cruel things to people. This response aligns with the meaning of the quote, as Peter feels a responsibility to use his powers for good. D: Powerful people are to blame for all the bad things that happen. The article focuses on Spiderman's efforts to protect people from harm, not on blaming powerful individuals for all the bad things that occur. This option does not reasonably reflect the meaning behind the quote. Based on the analysis, the most accurate explanation for \\"With great power, there must also come great responsibility\\" is: C: Powerful people should have a responsibility to do good."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Mark Kessler, the small-town Pennsylvania police chief who posted videos of himself firing automatic weapons while cursing about gun control, has been given a termination notice. The borough council of Gilberton, population 750, voted 6-1 to fire him at a meeting Thursday night, said council chairman Daniel J. Malloy. Kessler was suspended July 31 at a council meeting that drew thousands of his supporters, including some openly armed, to the small town in Schuylkill County in eastern Pennsylvania. He will remain on suspension for 10 days to give him time to appeal, Malloy said. He would not comment further. \\"We knew it was coming,\\" Kessler said after the vote, CNN affiliate WFMZ-TV reported. Kessler's attorney, Joseph Nahas, said he will request a public hearing next week, the affiliate reported. The council accused Kessler of misusing borough property, neglecting his duties and failing to turn over weapons to the borough, his lawyer said. But Kessler said the firing is \\"because of my videos.\\" In the videos, he rails against liberals for attempting to curb gun rights and Secretary of State John Kerry for supporting an arms treaty.

Premise: \\"Installation of the control device hookup on a sequential basis usually involves an overlap of compliance testing of FGD system on one unit with hookup of an FGD system with the next unit.\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"Hookup cannot proceed from one unit to the next until the first unit is completely hooked up and tested for compliance.\\" true?","output":"Based on the given premise, the hypothesis \\"Hookup cannot proceed from one unit to the next until the first unit is completely hooked up and tested for compliance.\\" appears to be false. The premise states that the installation of the control device hookup on a sequential basis usually involves an overlap of compliance testing of FGD (Flue-gas desulfurization) system on one unit with the hookup of an FGD system on the next unit. This implies that while one unit is undergoing compliance testing, the hookup process for the next unit may simultaneously commence. To further understand the reasoning behind this answer, let us break down the premise and the hypothesis to obtain a clearer picture of the interrelated processes. 1. Control device hookup on a sequential basis: This suggests that installations happen one after the other in an organized and consecutive manner. Units are progressively connected, establishing a systematic order in the installation process. 2. Overlap of compliance testing of FGD system on one unit with hookup of an FGD system on the next unit: As per this statement, the hookup of an FGD system on one unit takes place while the compliance testing for the previous unit is being conducted. It indicates that the processes are happening concurrently, not strictly one after the other. 3. Hypothesis: The hypothesis implies that installation of the FGD hookup on the next unit cannot begin until the previous unit has been entirely connected and tested for compliance. This would mean that the processes of hookup and compliance testing must occur sequentially without any overlap. Considering the information presented in the premise, it can be concluded that the hypothesis does not align with the statement. The premise specifically highlights the overlap of compliance testing and the hookup of the FGD system on the next unit. Therefore, the hookup process for the following unit does not necessarily have to wait until the first unit is fully connected and tested for compliance. In summary, according to the given premise, the hookup of a control device on a sequential basis can indeed proceed from one unit to the next while the previous unit is still undergoing compliance testing. This allows for a more efficient and streamlined workflow. Consequently, the hypothesis appears to be false in the context of this premise."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

War work again brought local prosperity during World War II, this time centered on Boeing aircraft. The war dispersed the city's numerous Japanese-American businessmen due to the Japanese American internment. After the war, the local economy dipped. It rose again with Boeing's growing dominance in the commercial airliner market. Seattle celebrated its restored prosperity and made a bid for world recognition with the Century 21 Exposition, the 1962 World's Fair. Another major local economic downturn was in the late 1960s and early 1970s, at a time when Boeing was heavily affected by the oil crises, loss of Government contracts, and costs and delays associated with the Boeing 747. Many people left the area to look for work elsewhere, and two local real estate agents put up a billboard reading \\"Will the last person leaving Seattle – Turn out the lights.\\"Seattle remained the corporate headquarters of Boeing until 2001, when the company separated its headquarters from its major production facilities; the headquarters were moved to Chicago. The Seattle area is still home to Boeing's Renton narrow-body plant (where the 707, 720, 727, and 757 were assembled, and the 737 is assembled today) and Everett wide-body plant (assembly plant for the 747, 767, 777, and 787). The company's credit union for employees, BECU, remains based in the Seattle area, though it is now open to all residents of Washington. Another boom began as the city emerged from the Great Recession which commenced when Amazon.com moved its headquarters from North Beacon Hill to South Lake Union. This initiated a historic construction boom which resulted in the completion of almost 10,000 apartments in Seattle in 2017, which is more than any previous year and nearly twice as many as were built in 2016.

Otto Maddox, a young punk rocker in L.A., is fired from his job as a supermarket stock clerk. His girlfriend leaves him for his best friend. Depressed and broke, Otto is wandering the streets when a man named Bud drives up and offers him 25 to drive a car out of the neighborhood. Otto follows Bud in the car to the Helping Hand Acceptance Corporation, where he learns that the car he drove was being repossessed. He refuses to join Bud as a \\"repo man,\\" and goes to his parents' house. He learns that his burned-out ex-hippie parents have donated the money they promised him for finishing school to a crooked televangelist. He decides to take the repo job. After repossessing a flashy red Cadillac, Otto sees a girl named Leila running down the street. He gives her a ride to her workplace, the United Fruitcake Outlet. On the way, Leila shows Otto pictures of aliens that she says are in the trunk of a Chevy Malibu. She claims that they are dangerous because of the radiation that they emit.

Popul re casino game Could you correct the punctuation please?","output":"Popular Casino Game: Casino games are a popular form of entertainment that provides individuals with an opportunity to test their luck and potentially win money. There are many casino games available, both in physical casinos and online platforms, and each has its unique characteristics and popularity among players. Here, we will discuss one of the most popular casino games: blackjack. Blackjack, also known as 21, is a card game played between one or more players and a dealer. The main objective of the game is for the player to have a hand value of cards that is closer to 21 than the dealer's hand without exceeding 21. The game is highly popular due to its relatively simple rules and the level of skill involved. The game begins with each player receiving two cards, both face-up. The dealer also receives two cards, but one is face-down and called the \\"hole card.\\" Players then have the option to either “hit” (receive additional cards) or “stand” (keep their current cards, hoping they have a higher hand than the dealer). Each card has a corresponding point value: number cards are worth their face value, face cards (kings, queens, and jacks) are worth 10 points each, and an ace can be worth either 1 point or 11 points, depending on which value would give the player's hand a better chance at winning. Players can continue requesting additional cards (hitting) until they either decide to stop (stand) or go over 21 points, at which point they \\"bust\\" and automatically lose the game. Once all the players have completed their respective turns, the dealer reveals their hole card. The dealer must hit until they have at least 17 points, after which they stand. The dealer can also bust, in which case any remaining players who have not busted win the game. If the dealer does not bust, then each player's hand is compared to the dealer's hand. Whoever has a hand value closer to, but not exceeding, 21 wins. If the value of both hands is equal, the game is considered a \\"push,\\" and no money is won or lost. There are various strategies that players can employ to increase their chances of winning. For example, players can use basic strategy charts to determine the optimal way to play, depending on their own hand and the dealer's face-up card. Card counting is another strategy used by more advanced players to predict the likelihood of high or low-value cards being dealt from the deck. However, card counting is frowned upon in most casinos, and players found doing it can be banned or face other penalties. In conclusion, blackjack is a highly popular casino game that offers an exciting blend of luck, skill, and strategy. Its simple rules and widespread availability make it a favorite among both novice and experienced casino-goers. Whether playing at a physical casino or an online platform, blackjack provides countless hours of entertainment and the potential for thrilling wins."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Southeast Asia consists of two geographic regions:  - Connie Chan Po - chu was born in 1946 to impoverished parents , one of at least nine siblings , in Guangdong , China . To increase their children 's chances of survival , Chan 's birth parents gave away some of their youngest to other families . As a result , Chan was adopted by Chan Fei - nung and his wife , Kung Fan - hung , who were renowned Cantonese opera stars . During the 1960s , Connie Chan was one of Hong Kong cinema 's most beloved teen idols . She made more than 230 films in a variety of genres : from traditional Cantonese opera and wuxia movies to contemporary youth musicals ; action films to comedies ; melodramas and romances . Owing to her popularity she was dubbed \`\` The Movie - Fan Princess '' . Her godfather is actor Cho Tat Wah . She has a son named Dexter Yeung , who stars in the 2008 TVB Series Wasabi Mon Amour and Moonlight Resonance .  - Shenzhen is a major city in Guangdong Province, China. The city is located immediately north of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and holds sub-provincial administrative status, with powers slightly less than a province.  - Mainland China, also known as the Chinese mainland or simply the mainland, is the geopolitical area under the direct jurisdiction of the People's Republic of China (PRC). It generally excludes the Special Administrative Regions of Hong Kong and Macau; however, it usually includes Hainan. The term \\"mainland China\\", which avoids calling the area simply \\"China\\" and thereby recognizing the founding of the PRC as \\"the\\" \\"China\\", was coined by the Kuomintang (KMT) after receiving control of Taiwan from Japan after World War II. By 1949, the KMT-led Republic of China (ROC) government was defeated in the Chinese Civil War in mainland China and fled to the island of Taiwan where the KMT pledged to \\"retake the Mainland\\". The KMT considers both sides of the Taiwan Strait (including Taiwan), as (one) \\"China\\" and one country, whereas Taiwan's Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) considers only mainland China as \\"China\\" and Taiwan (ROC) as \\"Taiwan\\" and maintains that they are different countries.  - Henan is a province of the People's Republic of China, located in the central part of the country. Its one-character abbreviation is \\"\\" (yù), named after Yuzhou, a Han Dynasty state (\\"zhou\\") that included parts of Henan. Although the name of the province means \\"south of the river\\", approximately a quarter of the province lies north of the Yellow River, also known as the \\"Huang He\\".  - Hong Kong, officially the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of China, is an autonomous territory on the Pearl River Delta of East Asia. Macau lies across the delta to the west, and the Chinese province of Guangdong borders the territory to the north. With a total land area of and a population of over 7.3 million of various nationalities, it ranks as the world's fourth most densely populated sovereign state or territory.  - The South China Sea is a marginal sea that is part of the Pacific Ocean, encompassing an area from the Karimata and Malacca Straits to the Strait of Taiwan of around . The area's importance largely results from one-third of the world's shipping sailing through its waters and that it is believed to hold huge oil and gas reserves beneath its seabed.  - Macau (literally: \\"Bay Gate\\"), (in Portuguese, which is still widely used in the city) also spelled Macao (in English), officially the Região Administrativa Especial de Macau da República Popular da China, is an autonomous territory on the western side of the Pearl River Delta in East Asia. Macau is bordered by the city of Zhuhai in China to the North and the Pearl River Estuary to the East and South. Hong Kong lies about to its East across the Delta. With a population of 650,900 living in an area of , it is the most densely populated region in the world.  - The Cantonese opera is one of the major categories in Chinese opera, originating in southern China's Guangdong Province. It is popular in Guangdong, Guangxi, Hong Kong, Macau and among the Chinese community in Southeast Asia. Like all versions of Chinese opera, it is a traditional Chinese art form, involving music, singing, martial arts, acrobatics, and acting. History. There is a debate about the origins of Cantonese opera, but it is generally accepted that opera was brought from the northern part of China and slowly migrated to the southern province of Guangdong in late 13th century, during the late Southern Song dynasty. In the 12th century, there was a theatrical form called the Nanxi or \\"Southern drama\\", which was performed in public theatres of Hangzhou, then capital of the Southern Song. With the invasion of the Mongol army, Emperor Gong of the Song dynasty fled with hundreds of thousands of Song people into Guangdong in 1276. Among them were Nanxi performers from Zhejiang, who brought Nanxi into Guangdong and helped develop the opera traditions in the south.  - Martial arts are codified systems and traditions of combat practices, which are practiced for a number of reasons: as self-defense, military and law enforcement applications, mental and spiritual development; as well as entertainment and the preservation of a nation's intangible cultural heritage.  - Chinese opera is a popular form of drama and musical theatre in China with roots going back to the early periods in China. It is a composite performance art that is an amalgamation of various art forms that existed in ancient China, and evolved gradually over more than a thousand years, reaching its mature form in the 13th century during the Song Dynasty. Early forms of Chinese drama are simple, but over time they incorporated various art forms, such as music, song and dance, martial arts, acrobatics, as well as literary art forms to become Chinese opera.  - Guangzhou , traditionally romanised as Canton, is the capital and largest city of the Province of Guangdong in southeastern China. Located on the Pearl River about north-northwest of Hong Kong and north of Macau, Guangzhou was a major terminus of the maritime Silk Road and continues to serve as a major port and transportation hub.  - Hangzhou, formerly romanized as Hangchow, is the capital and most populous city of Zhejiang Province in east China. It sits at the head of Hangzhou Bay, which separates Shanghai and Ningbo. Hangzhou grew to prominence as the southern terminus of the Grand Canal and has been one of the most renowned and prosperous cities in China for much of the last millennium, due in part to its beautiful natural scenery. The city's West Lake is its best-known attraction.  - Sichuan, formerly romanized as Szechwan, is a province in southwest China occupying most of the Sichuan Basin between the Himalayas on the west, the Daba in the north, and the Yungui Plateau to the east. Sichuan's capital is Chengdu.  - Cantonese, or Standard Cantonese, is a variant of Yue Chinese spoken in the vicinity of Guangzhou (known historically as Canton) in southeastern China. It is the traditional prestige dialect of Yue.  - , formerly romanized as Chekiang, is an eastern coastal province of China. Zhejiang is bordered by Jiangsu province and Shanghai municipality to the north, Anhui province to the northwest, Jiangxi province to the west, and Fujian province to the south; to the east is the East China Sea, beyond which lie the Ryukyu Islands of Japan.  - Acrobatics (from Greek  \\"akrobate\\", \\"walk on tiptoe, strut\\") is the performance of extraordinary feats of balance, agility, and motor coordination. It can be found in many of the performing arts, sports (sporting) events, and martial arts. Acrobatics is most often associated with activities that make extensive use of gymnastic elements, such as acro dance, circus, and gymnastics, but many other athletic activities  such as ballet and diving  may also employ acrobatics. Although acrobatics is most commonly associated with human body performance, it may also apply to other types of performance, such as aerobatics.  - Guangdong (Simplified ) is a province on the South China Sea coast of the People's Republic of China. Formerly romanised as Canton or Kwangtung, Guangdong surpassed Henan and Sichuan to become the most populous province in China in January 2005, registering 79.1 million permanent residents and 31 million migrants who lived in the province for at least six months of the year; the total population was 104,303,132 in the 2010 census, accounting for 7.79 percent of Mainland China's population.

Today, we'll talk about a topic called \\"monthly pension.\\" You might have heard your parents or grandparents mention this term before. A monthly pension is like getting an allowance, but it's for older people who have retired from their jobs. Every month, they get some money to spend on things they need or want. Now, let's try to find out how many dollars the monthly pension dropped between the years 2001 and 2004. Drop means the amount that it went down, like when your ice cream falls from your cone. Sad, I know, but we'll figure it out together! To find this out, we need two pieces of information: the monthly pension amount in 2001 and the monthly pension amount in 2004. Unfortunately, I cannot give you the exact number because it would be different depending on the person and their job. But let's pretend we have these numbers. Imagine in 2001, the monthly pension was 1000. Now, pretend that in 2004, the monthly pension became 800.  To find the difference (the drop) between these two numbers, we can play a little game of subtraction. Just like when you have 5 candy bars, and you eat 2, you'll have 3 left. In our case, we have: 1000 (pension in 2001) - 800 (pension in 2004) When we subtract 800 from 1000, we are left with 200. So, in our example, the monthly pension dropped by 200 between 2001 and 2004. Oh no! That's like losing two whole ice creams! 🍦🍦 Remember, these numbers were just pretend. The real-life amounts could be different. But now you know how to find out how much something like a monthly pension dropped by over a few years! Great job!"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Pointing to a color1ful flower, Campbell lifts her baby's soft hand, and rapidly moves it from one side of his nose to the other as she sniffs  .\\"Flower!\\" she says loudly. Gregory smiles and looks carefully. It could be a year before Gregory, 4 months old, can speak, but now his mother hopes to communicate with her baby through sign language. Like others around the world, Campbell is part of a growing movement of parents teaching hearing babies simple signs to communicate before they can talk. The baby sign language has been more popular in recent years. The movie,\\"Meet the Fockers\\",where the main character teaches his young grandson to sign, makes it well developed. Babies generally begin to talk between 12 and 15 months, but babies can use sign language to communicate before they learn how to speak. \\"We know they are learning language faster than they are able to show you with their speech production because that system takes a long time to develop.\\" says McRoberts, director of developmental research at the Haskins Laboratories. \\"They are understanding words before they are able to say them.

I slice the ribs into about 5mm / 3/16\\" slices, and add them towards the end; the leaves I cut into ribbons (perpendicular to the ribs), and stir them in at the last second, so they barely cook. The center I just chop the top off the leafy bit, and slice the more rib-like bits a litte larger than the rest of the ribs (they're thinner, so cook faster).As I've never tried steaming it, and I don't tend to cook in bags (except for silver turtles when camping), this is going to be a complete guess. Now, it tastes fine al dente, so you could leave the ribs as large as I use for a stir fry, but en papillote tends to be fancier cooking, so I'd probably try for maybe 1/6\\" slices or a little thicker (maybe 2-3mm), and if you had a mandoline so they all came out even, that'd be great.

Barry is specialized in subduction zones and new seafloor. Will is specialized in montology.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which person learned less about the Mid-Atlantic Ridge?  Hint: As new seafloor forms and spreads apart from the mid-ocean ridge it slowly cools over time. Older seafloor is, therefore, colder than new seafloor, and older oceanic basins deeper than new oceanic basins due to isostasy. If the diameter of the earth remains relatively constant despite the production of new crust, a mechanism must exist by which crust is also destroyed. The destruction of oceanic crust occurs at subduction zones where oceanic crust is forced under either continental crust or oceanic crust. Today, the Atlantic basin is actively spreading at the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Only a small portion of the oceanic crust produced in the Atlantic is subducted. However, the plates making up the Pacific Ocean are experiencing subduction along many of their boundaries which causes the volcanic activity in what has been termed the Ring of Fire of the Pacific Ocean. The Pacific is also home to one of the world's most active spreading centers (the East Pacific Rise) with spreading rates of up to 13  cm/yr. The Mid-Atlantic Ridge is a \\"textbook\\" slow-spreading center, while the East Pacific Rise is used as an example of fast spreading. Spreading centers at slow and intermediate rates exhibit a rift valley while at fast rates an axial high is found within the crustal accretion zone. The differences in spreading rates affect not only the geometries of the ridges but also the geochemistry of the basalts that are produced.Since the new oceanic basins are shallower than the old oceanic basins, the total capacity of the world's ocean basins decreases during times of active sea floor spreading. During the opening of the Atlantic Ocean, sea level was so high that a Western Interior Seaway formed across North America from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic Ocean. The answer is:","output":"Will learned less about the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The given paragraph presents detailed information about the formation and characteristics of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, which is related to the creation of new seafloor as well as subduction zones. In the given context, Barry is specialized in subduction zones and new seafloor, so his area of expertise is directly related to the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and its formation processes. Barry would have more knowledge about the geological processes associated with the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, such as the spreading of the ocean floor and the characteristics of the oceanic crust in that region. On the other hand, Will is specialized in montology, which is the study of mountains. Although mountains can also be formed due to tectonic processes that happen at the subduction zones or spreading centers, the paragraph emphasizes the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and gives no information about the formation of mountains in that specific region. Thus, Will's expertise in montology would provide him with less knowledge about the Mid-Atlantic Ridge compared to Barry's expertise in subduction zones and new seafloor. In conclusion, based on their areas of specialization, Will learned less about the Mid-Atlantic Ridge than Barry. As Will's expertise revolves around mountains and their formation processes, it does not directly connect him to the geological processes mentioned in the paragraph, while Barry's study of subduction zones and new seafloor places him in a better position to understand and analyze the information given about the Mid-Atlantic Ridge."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

As the two women sat on the park bench under a large oak tree, Rebecca began to share her thoughts regarding the sermon she had heard last Sunday.

It wasn't just the words of the sermon that held her interest; it was also the power of Rebecca's transformation. The once skeptical and guarded woman was now open and expressive, shedding light on her newfound faith. Step 5: Show Mary's interest and response to Rebecca's newfound faith.

Fiction constitutes an act of creative invention, so that faithfulness to reality is not typically assumed; in other words, fiction is not expected to present only characters who are actual people or descriptions that are factually true. The context of fiction is generally open to interpretation, due to fiction's freedom from any necessary embedding in reality; however, some fictional works are claimed to be, or marketed as, historically or factually accurate, complicating the traditional distinction between fiction and non-fiction. Fiction is a classification or category, rather than a specific mode or genre, unless used in a narrower sense as a synonym for a particular literary fiction form.  - Prose is a form of language that exhibits a grammatical structure and a natural flow of speech, rather than a rhythmic structure as in traditional poetry. Where the common unit of verse is based on meter or rhyme, the common unit of prose is purely grammatical, such as a sentence or paragraph.  - Santiago de Compostela, commonly known as Santiago, is the capital of the autonomous community of Galicia in northwestern Spain.  - A narrative or story is any report of connected events, real or imaginary, presented in a sequence of written or spoken words, and/or still or moving images.  - Spain, officially the Kingdom of Spain, is a sovereign state largely located on the Iberian Peninsula in southwestern Europe, with two large archipelagos, the Balearic Islands in the Mediterranean Sea and the Canary Islands off the North African Atlantic coast, two cities Ceuta and Melilla in the North African mainland and several small islands in the Alboran Sea near the Moroccan coast. Its mainland is bordered to the south and east by the Mediterranean Sea except for a small land boundary with Gibraltar; to the north and northeast by France, Andorra, and the Bay of Biscay; and to the west and northwest by Portugal and the Atlantic Ocean. It is the only European country to have a border with an African country (Morocco) and its African territory accounts for nearly 5% of its population, mostly in the Canary Islands but also in Ceuta and Melilla.  - Paulo Coelho de Souza (, , ; born August 24, 1947) is a Brazilian lyricist and novelist. He is the recipient of numerous international awards, amongst them the Crystal Award by the World Economic Forum. His novel \\"The Alchemist\\" has been translated into 81 languages.

New Zealand international Luke Ronchi's spectacular 19-ball half-century helped the Foxes reach 183-6 as they won with two balls to spare. Ronchi made 57, backed up by Colin Ackermann's unbeaten 58, off 47 balls. In the South Group, Kent maintained their own quarter-final hopes with a six-wicket win against Somerset. Leicestershire earned their first home win in this season's competition to claim a second North Group victory inside 24 hours. Their previous five wins had come away from Leicester - but going into their final two games, the three-times T20 winners are now one of four clubs on 13 points. They include third-placed Yorkshire, who were powered by half-centuries by Tom Kohler-Cadmore (75 from 40 balls - his best T20 score since arriving from Worcestershire) and Australian Shaun Marsh (60). But the Tykes, lifted by beating rivals Lancashire at Headingley the previous evening, have just one group game left, at home to second-placed Northants on Thursday, and they must win to stand any chance of qualifying. Derbyshire and the Birmingham Bears are the other three sides on 13 points, two behind group leaders Notts Outlaws, who are a point ahead of Northants. Kent's New Zealand paceman Adam Milne claimed a county-best 5-11 as the bottom-of-the-table Spitfires caused an upset in the South Group, beating Somerset by six wickets at Taunton. Milne sent down 15 dot balls from 23 deliveries as the hosts were dismissed for 149 in 18.5 overs. England one-day international Sam Billings then battered an unbeaten 56 from 36 balls as the visitors reached their target with nine deliveries to spare, to inflict Somerset's first home defeat in this year's competition. \\"We have a really good record here at Taunton,\\" Billings told BBC Radio Bristol. \\"The guys love playing on this square. That's eight wins on the trot for us here. \\"The dismissal of James Hildreth was a key moment and Adam Milne weighed into the tail after that. He was outstanding.\\" Somerset captain Jim Allenby, whose side face Glamorgan at Taunton on Sunday, said: \\"We had a poor day at the office with the bat. But we are still fourth in the table, having played poorly in a few games, so it's not all doom and gloom.\\" Kent are now up to sixth on 11 points, four points behind group leaders Hampshire, who are ahead of second-placed Glamorgan by a point, followed by three sides on 12 points - Sussex, Somerset and Gloucestershire.","output":"Luke Ronchi's 19-ball half-century helped Leicestershire Foxes win against Yorkshire, while Kent secured a quarter-final spot with a victory over Somerset in the T20 Blast competition."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Pick from: (a). no. (b). yes.","output":"(b). yes. Based on the given information, the statement \\"Cooper had been dead for five years\\" appears to be accurate. In the provided context, it is mentioned that \\"Thomson visited Cooper's grave in 1765.

In 1765, Thomson paid a visit to Cooper's grave, which is an event that occurred five years after Cooper's death. 2. If we subtract five years from the date of Thomson's visit (1765), we can determine the year Cooper died. Thus, Cooper passed away in 1760 (1765 - 5 = 1760). Taking these conclusions into account, the statement \\"Cooper had been dead for five years\\" would indeed be accurate, as it corresponds with the information provided.

Many early 19th-century neoclassical architects were influenced by the drawings and projects of Étienne-Louis Boullée and Claude Nicolas Ledoux. The many graphite drawings of Boullée and his students depict spare geometrical architecture that emulates the eternality of the universe. There are links between Boullée's ideas and Edmund Burke's conception of the sublime. Ledoux addressed the concept of architectural character, maintaining that a building should immediately communicate its function to the viewer: taken literally such ideas give rise to \\"architecture parlante\\".  The baroque style had never truly been to the English taste. Four influential books were published in the first quarter of the 18th century which highlighted the simplicity and purity of classical architecture: Vitruvius Britannicus (Colen Campbell 1715), Palladio's Four Books of Architecture (1715), De Re Aedificatoria (1726) and The Designs of Inigo Jones... with Some Additional Designs (1727). The most popular was the four-volume Vitruvius Britannicus by Colen Campbell. The book contained architectural prints of famous British buildings that had been inspired by the great architects from Vitruvius to Palladio. At first the book mainly featured the work of Inigo Jones, but the later tomes contained drawings and plans by Campbell and other 18th-century architects.

But even today, teachers are role models for students. Teaching is still a respectable job. But there are great changes in the education system. One of the most obvious changes is that the influence of Western culture has increased. We are paying too much attention to doing business, just like the Western world. Teachers are likely to to be influenced by this too, but it is not good. Teachers are nation builders. The development of any country depends upon its education system.

Julian Paul Assange (; ne Hawkins; born 3 July 1971) is an Australian computer programmer and the editor of WikiLeaks. Assange founded WikiLeaks in 2006, but came to international attention in 2010, when WikiLeaks published a series of leaks provided by Chelsea Manning. These leaks included the Collateral Murder video (April 2010), the Afghanistan war logs (July 2010), the Iraq war logs (October 2010), and CableGate (November 2010). Following the 2010 leaks, the federal government of the United States launched a criminal investigation into WikiLeaks and asked allied nations for assistance. Assange was born in Townsville, Queensland, to Christine Ann Hawkins (b. 1951), a visual artist, and John Shipton, an anti-war activist and builder. The couple had separated before Assange was born.  When he was a year old, his mother married Richard Brett Assange, an actor, with whom she ran a small theatre company. They divorced around 1979. Christine Assange then became involved with Leif Meynell, also known as Leif Hamilton, a member of Australian cult The Family, with whom she had a son before the couple broke up in 1982. Assange had a nomadic childhood, and had lived in over thirty Australian towns by the time he reached his mid-teens, when he settled with his mother and half-brother in Melbourne, Victoria.  He attended many schools, including Goolmangar Primary School in New South Wales (1979-1983) and Townsville State High School, as well as being schooled at home. He studied programming, mathematics, and physics at Central Queensland University (1994) and the University of Melbourne (2003-2006), but did not complete a degree.  While in his teens, Assange married a woman named Teresa, and in 1989 they had a son, Daniel Assange, now a software designer. The couple separated and initially disputed custody of their child. Assange was Daniel's primary caregiver for much of his childhood. In an open letter to French President Francois Hollande, Assange stated his youngest child lives in France with his mother. He also said that his family had faced death threats and harassment because of his work, forcing them to change identities and reduce contact with him.

Is it true that did they wear tie dye in the 70s based on the following text? Unlike regular resist-dyeing techniques, tie-dye is characterized by the use of bright, saturated primary colors and bold patterns. These patterns, including the spiral, mandala, and peace sign, and the use of multiple bold colors, have become cliched since the peak popularity of tie-dye in the 1960s and 1970s. The vast majority of currently produced tie-dyes use these designs, and many are mass-produced for wholesale distribution. However, a new interest in more 'sophisticated' tie-dye is emerging in the fashion industry, characterized by simple motifs, monochromatic color schemes, and a focus on fashionable garments and fabrics other than cotton.

China is facing its worst wave of labour unrest since a series of wildcat strikes at Japanese-owned car plants last year, as declining export orders force factories to reduce worker pay. More than 10,000 workers in Shenzhen and Dongguan, two leading export centres in southern Guangdong province, have gone on strike over the past week. The latest protests broke out on Tuesday at a Taiwanese computer factory in Shenzhen. \\"There has been an intensification of labour unrest in the past week that is probably the most significant spike in unrest since the summer of 2010,\\" said Geoffrey Crothall of China Labour Bulletin, a Hong Kong-based labour advocacy group that monitors unrest in China. The strikes come amid mounting concerns about the global economy, which is suffering from the European sovereign debt crisis and a weak recovery in the US. Fears about the Chinese economy grew on Wednesday after a manufacturing index compiled by HSBC fell to levels not seen since March 2009. Last week, Guangdong's acting governor said the province's exports dropped 9 per cent in October from the previous month. Provincial leaders are also contending with widespread protests by farmers over land seizures. On Monday nearly 5,000 residents in the town of Wukan marched on government offices in a peaceful protest. Factories are cutting the overtime that workers depend on to supplement their modest base salaries, after a drop in overseas orders. According to CLB, the average basic wage for electronic workers is about Rmb1,500 (236) a month, but rises to Rmb2,500 with overtime. \\"Their basic wage is never enough on its own without overtime,\\" Mr Crothall said. Tuesday's protests followed a bigger demonstration last week at a shoe factory in Dongguan that supplies footwear to Nike and Adidas. About 7,000 workers at the Taiwanese factory, owned by Pou Chen, objected to a cut in their overtime and management's decision to shift some work to other factories in the Chinese hinterland and Vietnam, where labour costs are lower. \\"We were forced to return to the factory,\\" one worker told the Financial Times. \\"But we just sit there. No one is operating machines.\\" The worker, who did not want to be identified, said the local government had taken a tough stance during negotiations and sided with the management. With additional reporting by Zhou Ping. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"China is experiencing a significant increase in labor unrest as declining export orders cause factories to cut worker pay.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Sheep Smarter than Thought London--Sheep, like turkeys and ostriches, are not considered the most clever animals. British scientists said last Wednesday humans may have underestimated the woolly creature. They could be much smarter than we think. Researchers at the Babraham Institute in Cambridge, southern England, have shown that the animals have a good memory system and are extremely good at recognizing faces--which they think is a sure sign of intelligence. Behavioral scientist Keith Kendrick and his friends trained 20 sheep to recognize and distinguish 25 pairs of sheep faces and used electrodes   to measure their brain activity , which showed they could remember 50 faces for up to two years . \\"If they can do that with faces, they have to have reasonable intelligence; otherwise, what is the point of having a system for remembering faces and not remembering anything else?\\" Kendrick said in an interview. So hours of seemingly mindless eating grass may not be so mindless after all. Kendrick believes sheep got their reputation as dumb (unable to speak, unintelligent) animals because they live in large groups and do not appear to have much individuality and are frightened of just about everything. \\"All animals, including humans, once they are frightened, don't tend to show signs of intelligent action,\\" he explained.

A tuxedo and a normal suit are both types of clothing worn by people, usually men, for special events or occasions. However, they have some differences. A tuxedo is fancier and more formal than a normal suit. It usually has satin or silk details on the lapels, buttons, and side stripes on the pants. Tuxedos are often worn with a bow tie and a cummerbund or a waistcoat. A normal suit is a bit more casual and can be worn for different events like business meetings, weddings, or parties. Suits usually have matching pants and jackets made from the same fabric, and they are often worn with a regular tie.

Choices:  - two  - seven  - four  - three  A: Answer:","output":"The body contains three types of muscle tissue. These are: 1. Skeletal muscle: These are the muscles attached to bones by tendons, and they help in body movement through contraction and relaxation. Skeletal muscle fibers are long, cylindrical, and multinucleated, with a striped (striated) appearance. They are also known as voluntary muscles because we can consciously control their movements. 2. Smooth muscle: Found in the walls of internal organs such as the intestines, blood vessels, and stomach, smooth muscles help in maintaining normal functioning (such as pushing food through the digestive tract or constricting blood vessels to regulate blood flow). Smooth muscle fibers are spindle-shaped, non-striated, and have one central nucleus. They are also called involuntary muscles because their movements are not under conscious control. 3. Cardiac muscle: This muscle type is found only in the heart and is responsible for pumping blood throughout the body. Cardiac muscle fibers are also striated, but they are branched and have one or two nuclei. Cardiac muscles work involuntarily and are capable of rhythmic contractions without external stimulation or fatigue. So, the correct answer is three types of muscle tissue."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. I normally do not post certain types of things on my blog or on social media, like political messages, but today I feel compelled. I’ve been thinking for the last few days about the most recent school shooting in Parkland, and my overwhelming emotion right after grief is rage. I am so angry it makes me cry and for those of you out there who know me, angry-cry is the end-stage, top-of-the-gauge level of angry for me. I am angry that as a nation, we continue to wring our hands and bemoan each mass shooting but we don’t take any action to stop the next one. I am angry that our elected officials have failed us in the most spectacular way possible by being unable to work together or to set aside special interests to protect the lives and safety of Americans, including our most vulnerable citizens, our children. I am angry that time and time again, we the people and our elected officials weigh the value of human lives against countless other things (Second Amendment, special interests, party disagreements, inertia, whatever) and the value of human life comes up short in the calculations. I am angry at myself for believing at any point in the last several years that I could trust lawmakers to address this epidemic and I am angry at myself for feeling so helpless that I have not personally taken action. This stops now. I am angry that in 2012, 20 6-7 year old children and 6 adults were murdered in Sandy Hook and in the 5+ years since, we have done nothing meaningful to stop this.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: The Quiet Man Context: Sean and Mary Kate In the 1920s, Sean Thornton (John Wayne), an Irish-born American from Pittsburgh, travels to Ireland to reclaim his family's farm and his birthplace in Inisfree. He meets and falls in love with the fiery Mary Kate Danaher (Maureen O'Hara), the sister of the bullying, loud-mouthed landowner Squire \\"Red\\" Will Danaher (Victor McLaglen). Danaher, who had wanted the farm himself, is angry that the Widow Tillane (herself angered by Danaher's admission that he had discussed her in the local pub) accepts Sean's bid, and retaliates by refusing consent for his sister to marry. Several town locals, including the Catholic priest, Father Lonergan (Ward Bond), conspire to trick him into believing that the wealthy Widow Tillane (Mildred Natwick) wants to marry him, but only if Mary Kate is no longer living in his house. After learning the truth on Sean and Mary Kate's wedding day, an enraged Will refuses to give his sister her dowry which is made up of a large sum of money and her family possessions passed down from her mother. Sean, unschooled in Irish customs, cares nothing about the dowry, but to Mary Kate the dowry represents her independence, identity, and pride. She feels passionately and intensely that the dowry is hers and is needed to validate her marriage to Sean. Angered and shamed by Sean's refusal to confront her brother and demand what is legally hers, she brands him a coward, and, despite living together, they are quickly estranged as husband and wife. In the morning they find that others in the village had visited Will and pressured him to return Mary Kate's furniture, but not her money. Sean had been a boxer in the United States, a heavyweight challenger known as \\"Trooper Thorn\\". After accidentally killing an opponent in the ring, Sean hung up his gloves, vowing never to fight again. This is known to only one person in the village, the Church of Ireland minister, the Rev. Playfair (Arthur Shields), who once upon a time had been the lightweight champion and so understands Thornton's... Answer:","output":"In the movie The Quiet Man, Sean Thornton, played by John Wayne, is an Irish-born American who returns to Ireland to reclaim his family's farm in Inisfree. Sean falls in love with Mary Kate Danaher, portrayed by Maureen O'Hara, and eventually marries her despite opposition from her brother, Squire \\"Red\\" Will Danaher. The crux of the issue revolves around Mary Kate's dowry, which her brother Will refuses to give her. The dowry consists of a large sum of money and her family possessions, which are of great importance to Mary Kate as they represent her independence, identity, and pride. Sean, who is not familiar with Irish customs, initially does not care about the dowry, causing a rift between him and Mary Kate. However, after a series of events including pressure from the village people, Will returns Mary Kate's furniture but keeps the money. Sean was once a professional boxer known as \\"Trooper Thorn\\" and had quit boxing after accidentally killing an opponent in the ring. Only the Church of Ireland minister, Rev. Playfair, knows about Sean's past as a boxer. Towards the end of the movie, Sean confronts Will Danaher to resolve the issue once for all. Sean drags Will to the town where he forcibly takes the money from him and pours it into a stove in front of the entire village. This act is a powerful statement by Sean that emphasizes the importance of love, pride, and respect over material possessions. It ultimately earns him the respect and admiration of the community, but more importantly, it reconciles him with his wife Mary Kate. In the end, Sean shows that it is not the money itself that matters, but the principle behind it, demonstrating his commitment to Irish customs and his wife's values. So, to answer the question: Sean uses the money to prove a point about the importance of respect, love, and dignity, reconciling with his wife and earning the community's respect by pouring the money into a stove in front of everyone."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Paragraph 1: The impact of backing Trump early on Step 1: Discuss the advantages gained by early Trump supporters on Capitol Hill. Trump's early backers on Capitol Hill have seen their political careers and national recognition flourish thanks to their unwavering support for the former president. Some have landed influential committee positions, while others have increased their media presence and overall political influence. Paragraph 2: High-profile early supporters Step 1: Mention key Trump supporters in Congress Some of the high-profile early supporters on Capitol Hill include Senator Lindsey Graham, Representatives Jim Jordan, and Matt Gaetz, who have gained considerable political clout and notoriety as a result of their allegiance to Trump. Step 2: Discuss how their profiles have been raised These legislators have been prominently featured in the media and have developed large followings both in their home states and across the country. They have also received increased campaign donations and political support, which have bolstered their positions within the Republican Party. Paragraph 3: The impact on the Republican Party Step 1: Explain how these rising profiles have affected the party The elevation of Trump's early backers on Capitol Hill has demonstrated how the Republican Party has shifted more towards Trumpism, embracing his policies and rhetoric. This has deepened divisions within the party, with traditional Republicans being pitted against a more populist and nationalist faction. Step 2: Highlight party tensions These tensions came to a head during the January 6th insurrection, with pro-Trump politicians being criticized and even being threatened with censure by members of their own party. Despite these pressures, many of these early supporters have doubled down on their loyalty, maintaining their profile and further highlighting fractures within the GOP. Conclusion: The future of Trump's early backers Step 1: Discuss potential future trajectories The future of Trump's early backers on Capitol Hill will largely depend on the overall direction of the Republican Party. Should the party continue to embrace Trumpism, these politicians may continue to benefit from their allegiance and further consolidate their power and influence. Step 2: Address potential shifts in the political landscape Alternatively, if the GOP shifts course and distances itself from Trump, these early backers may see their profiles diminished as the party looks to move in a new direction. Only time will tell how the political landscape will evolve, but it is clear that the early support for Trump has had a significant impact on the careers and profiles of these politicians."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Asks Rich Nations for Support WASHINGTON — The International Monetary Fund, showing heightened concern over a slowing world economy, said on Tuesday that cash-rich countries like Germany needed to step up large public investments to help keep the flagging global recovery on track. The comments — from the fund’s managing director and its lead economist — reflect growing concerns within the I.M.F. that Germany, which recently passed China as the country with the largest trade surplus in the world, is not doing enough to spur growth in Europe. At a news conference at the start of its semiannual meeting, an event that attracts financiers, policy makers and central bankers from around the globe, the fund’s top economists highlighted a shift in the global economy in which many major nations are failing to keep up with what is still a relatively modest recovery in the United States. In an interview on Friday, Christine Lagarde, the managing director of the fund, said global growth risked being stuck in a rut for a long time. “If nothing gets done in a bold way, there is a risk of a new mediocre” level of growth for the global economy, she said. And she took note that Germany could do more to stoke growth in Europe. “Given Germany’s current position, it could certainly spend more on infrastructure,” she said. The fund’s growth worries were underscored on Tuesday when Germany said that orders for industrial goods in August shrank by the largest amount since 2009, plunging 4 percent on a month-over-month basis. For investors, the warnings in the I.M.F. forecast and the report from Germany helped send the broad stock market down sharply on Tuesday, with the Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index falling 1.5 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average and the Nasdaq each fell about 1.6 percent. The I.M.F. brought its estimate for global growth this year down to 3.3 percent from 3.7 percent and reduced its forecast for 2015 to 3.8 percent. The fund pointed to weaker growth in China, Europe, Japan and Latin America — Brazil in particular — as the main culprits behind the broad retrenchment. Germany’s growth forecast for 2014 was cut sharply to 1.4 percent from 1.9 percent. Its estimate for United States growth in 2015, 3.1 percent, outpaces all major industrialized countries and exceeds as well a number of emerging markets, which in theory are supposed to grow at a substantially more rapid clip. The assessment reflected a broad acceptance by global investors that, at least for the near future, the United States economy was set to advance ahead of many large economies, not just in terms of growth but also in corporate profitability and international competitiveness. As a result, large investors and central banks have become aggressive purchasers of the dollar, betting that the currency will keep rising in value against the euro, the yen and the wobbly currencies of countries like Russia, Brazil and Turkey. Economists have been warning for some time now that a situation in which the American economy becomes the prime engine for the global recovery brings with it significant risks by creating financial uncertainty in emerging markets as currencies weaken and capital flows reverse. “At this stage, the question is, can the U.S. continue to power along while the rest of the world acts as a drag on global growth,” said Eswar Prasad, a professor of international finance at Cornell University and the author of a recent book on the dollar. “This is a very unbalanced recovery.” Fund economists expect annual growth in the eurozone of just 0.8 percent, with inflation coming in at 0.9 percent — a figure that Ms. Lagarde raised pointed concerns about. “We’ve been warning for over a year now about persistent low inflation, and frankly we faced a bit of denial — everyone said we don’t need to think about it,” she said. “But now it’s there.” The fund unveiled this week a paper arguing that large-scale infrastructure investments, if properly undertaken, could bring relatively quick growth benefits — a message that seemed to be directed at deficit-obsessed eurozone governments, including Germany. “Infrastructure investment, even if debt-financed, may well be justified,” Olivier Blanchard, the fund’s senior economist, said at the news conference on Tuesday. And while he did not mention Germany by name, he left little doubt to whom he was broadly referring. “Eurozone countries should be ready to do more,” Mr. Blanchard said. Mr. Blanchard pointed out that with interest rates at modern-day lows — Germany can borrow money for 10 years at below 1 percent — taking on extra debt to stimulate the economy need not be seen as profligacy. He offered up a brief economic primer to underscore his point. “It is an irony of macroeconomics,” he said with a small smile, “that for countries with too much debt, sometimes the solution is to create more debt.” Mr. Blanchard, who oversees economic research at the I.M.F., was behind the fund’s public recognition two years ago that heavy-handed austerity policies in Europe had a larger-than-expected impact on economic growth. Now, it seems, the global watchdog seems to be going one step further by urging eurozone officials to relax their rigid austerity measures. Both Ms. Lagarde and Mr. Blanchard also made it clear that they had their doubts about the two-year bull run in eurozone government bonds. Ms. Lagarde, in the interview, said that there was a “disconnect between what’s happening in markets and, on the other hand, progress in the real economy.” Mr. Blanchard said that the markets “were too complacent” and that policy makers should be especially watchful. “The risk is there,” he cautioned. The tough tone may well reflect a sense within the fund that this time around it needs to be more forceful in warning of financial trouble spots before it is too late. The I.M.F. was criticized for not spotting the last financial crisis. It has responded by recently publishing a series of papers outlining how it might improve on its watchdog capabilities. The fund has repeatedly cautioned that investors have become too reliant on very loose monetary policies on the part of global central banks to bolster their returns. Wholesale purchases of bonds by monetary authorities have inflated equity and bond markets in countries around the world where investments were minimal and growth subpar, economists for the fund said in the report. The warning echoes a rising chorus from economists and regulators who say that when the Federal Reserve in the United States starts raising interest rates — expected to begin in 2015 — so-called hot money flows that sought out high-yielding but risky returns in Europe and in emerging markets, including China, will head for safer shores. A consequence could be a broad disruption in financial markets, similar to but greater in scope than the market spasm that hit markets in the developing world earlier this year.

They are especially asking Germany to spend more money on things like roads and bridges, which will help Europe as a whole. The IMF is worried that many countries are not growing as quickly as they should, and they think that the United States cannot solve this problem all by itself.

Question: A friend asked me to answer this question: Whose wife is taking up the spiritual life in an ashram in India?, using the article: In an American suburb in Northern New Jersey, conservative, middle-aged Indian immigrant Gopal, a telephone-company engineer who has taken early retirement, is celebrating Diwali in November with his wife and grown daughter. His daughter suddenly tells him that she is leaving indefinitely to teach English in Mongolia with her German boyfriend. As Gopal recovers from this shock and tries to talk her out of it, largely on the grounds that she will be living in sin in his eyes, his wife Madhu announces that she is leaving him as well, and is taking up the spiritual life in an ashram in India. Confused, mortified, bored, and directionless, newly single Gopal lies to his few Indian-American acquaintances about the situation, and refuses to answer his daughter's phone calls from Mongolia. He tries to cope with his emptiness by redecorating slightly, searching through the various corners of his small house, reading newspapers, and watching videos of Bollywood romance extravaganza films. Desperately lonely, he latches upon a copy of Cosmopolitan magazine that had belonged to his daughter, and takes a quiz gauging a man's suitability for a relationship – which reveals that he is a \\"Ditchable Dude\\". In the midst of his distress and his Bollywood fantasies, Gopal's eccentric neighbor, the oddly attractive divorcée Mrs. Shaw – whom he had previously thought of as loose-moralled (because of her one-night stands) and slovenly – appears at his door asking to borrow one of his rakes. This sets off a whole new set of fantasies on his part. A few nights later Gopal sees her on her porch nursing a drink, and after a tentative conversation, asks her to have Thanksgiving dinner with him at home the next day. While cleaning and straightening for the date, Gopal finds several more of his daughter's Cosmopolitans, and reads several articles on \\"What women want\\" from a man – evidently it is for them to \\"listen, listen, listen\\"., what would be the answer ?

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Dame Agatha Mary Clarissa Christie, Lady Mallowan,  (nee Miller; 15 September 1890 - 12 January 1976) was an English writer. She is known for her 66 detective novels and 14 short story collections, particularly those revolving around her fictional detectives Hercule Poirot and Miss Marple. Christie also wrote the world's longest-running play, a murder mystery, The Mousetrap, and six romances under the name Mary Westmacott. In 1971 she was appointed a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire (DBE) for her contribution to literature. Christie had long been a fan of detective novels, having enjoyed Wilkie Collins's The Woman in White and The Moonstone, as well as Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's early Sherlock Holmes stories. She wrote her own detective novel, The Mysterious Affair at Styles, featuring Hercule Poirot, a former Belgian police officer noted for his twirly large \\"magnificent moustaches\\" and egg-shaped head. Poirot had taken refuge in Britain after Germany invaded Belgium. Christie's inspiration for the character stemmed from real Belgian refugees who were living in Torquay and the Belgian soldiers whom she helped treat as a volunteer nurse in Torquay during the First World War.  Agatha began working on The Mysterious Affair at Styles in 1916, writing most of it on Dartmoor. Her original manuscript was rejected by such publishing companies as Hodder and Stoughton and Methuen. After keeping the submission for several months, John Lane at The Bodley Head offered to accept it, provided that Christie change the ending. She did so, and signed a contract which she later felt was exploitative. It was finally published in 1920.  Christie, meanwhile, settled into married life, giving birth to her only child, daughter Rosalind Margaret Hicks, in August 1919 at Ashfield, where the couple spent much of their time, having few friends in London. Archie left the Air Force at the end of the war and started working in the City financial sector at a relatively low salary, though they still employed a maid.  Christie's second novel, The Secret Adversary (1922), featured a new detective couple Tommy and Tuppence, again published by The Bodley Head. It earned her PS50. A third novel again featured Poirot, Murder on the Links (1923), as did short stories commissioned by Bruce Ingram, editor of The Sketch magazine. In order to tour the world promoting the British Empire Exhibition, the couple left their daughter Rosalind with Agatha's mother and sister. They travelled to South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, and Hawaii.  They learned to surf prone in South Africa; then, in Waikiki, they were among the first Britons to surf standing up. Ask a question about this article.","output":"Agatha Christie was an English writer who created interesting mystery stories. She is famous for writing 66 detective novels with characters like Hercule Poirot and Miss Marple. She wrote a very popular play called The Mousetrap and some romantic stories too.

Does the sentence \\"It is widely regarded as a marker for the start of land plant evolution during the Ordovician period.\\" answer the question \\"What polymer is a major part of wood?\\"","output":"No, the sentence \\"It is widely regarded as a marker for the start of land plant evolution during the Ordovician period\\" does not answer the question \\"What polymer is a major part of wood?\\" The statement refers to the evolutionary history of land plants rather than the composition of wood. A more appropriate answer to the question \\"What polymer is a major part of wood?\\" would be: Lignin is a complex organic polymer that is considered a major constituent of wood, along with cellulose and hemicellulose. Lignin is responsible for the rigid structure and strength of wood, making it an essential component in the plant cell walls of woody plants. Wood is primarily composed of three main polymers: cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. Cellulose is a long chain of glucose molecules that interweave to form strong microfibrils. These microfibrils are embedded in a matrix of hemicellulose, which is a more heterogeneous polymer built from a variety of sugar molecules, including xylose, mannose, and galactose, among others. The cellulose-hemicellulose matrix provides wood with its flexibility and resistance to being compressed. Lignin is the other major component of wood, accounting for 15-40% of its dry weight, depending on the plant species and the part of the plant being analyzed. It is a complex, three-dimensional polymer that is primarily composed of three phenylpropane-type monomers called p-hydroxyphenyl (H), guaiacyl (G), and syringyl (S) units. The monomer units are arranged in different proportions and structures, resulting in a variation of lignin structure among plant species. Lignin plays a crucial role in the vascular system of plants, conferring mechanical support and protection to the plant cell walls, as well as waterproofing in the form of lignified xylem vessels. By encasing the cellulose fibers and forming covalent bonds with hemicellulose, lignin contributes to the overall strength and rigidity of the plant cell walls and helps maintain the upright growth of land plants. In summary, lignin is a major polymer found in wood, providing essential mechanical support and structural stability. Together with cellulose and hemicellulose, these polymers contribute to the unique hardness, flexibility, and resistance of wood."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Memar soon realizes that Rahmat is not fit for such hard work, and decides to switch the jobs between Rahmat and Lateef. Lateef is furious, threatens Rahmat, tries to sabotage his work and spies on him. One day, by looking through the door where Rahmat works, he is totally shocked to discover that Rahmat is a girl. As he watches her comb her hair, he finds himself in a strange state, surrounded by unusual sounds.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  BookWars is a creative documentary which is told in an unconventional, narrative style. The film opens with the narrator (who is also the film's director) driving out West along a desert highway, relating to the audience his previous experiences as a streetside bookseller in New York City. The entire documentary – including the central events involving his experiences among the street booksellers in New York – is thus \\"told\\" as a long conversation. The narrator describes his post-graduation years in New York, and how he ended up at one point virtually penniless. Driven by a desperate need to pay the rent, he resorts to wheeling his own books out to the street to try to sell them. He reveals that he was not only successful in making a significant amount of cash on that first day, but he has also met a variety of interesting and strange characters of the streets of New York – including other street booksellers. A motley assortment of street booksellers on West 4th street, in Greenwich Village, New York City, are first introduced. Among them: \\"Slick\\" Rick Sherman, a semi-professional magician; Al Mappo, so named because he only sells maps and atlases; Emil, who says only he \\"escaped\\", though we do not know from where; and Pete Whitney: King of the booksellers, toad collector, and collage artist. BookWars next introduces another group of street booksellers who hawk their trade on nearby 6th Avenue. Mainly black and minority individuals, they ply books and magazines in parallel fashion to the nearby West 4th street booksellers, who are primarily white. The booksellers on 6th Avenue suffer greater exposure to the law, with many claiming this to be due to racial profiling. Some of the significant personalities that are introduced on 6th Avenue include: Marvin, always wearing his trademark black hat; and Ron, from Jamaica – charismatic, streetwise and outspoken.

Which type of energy in gasoline is transformed into mechanical energy in a motorcycle engine? Options are:  --chemical.  --nuclear.  --magnetic.  --electrical.","output":"The type of energy in gasoline that is transformed into mechanical energy in a motorcycle engine is chemical energy. Gasoline, as a type of fuel, stores chemical energy. The elements such as carbon and hydrogen in gasoline have bonds that hold a significant amount of potential energy. This chemical energy is released when the gasoline is combusted or burned in a controlled environment like an engine. Let's go through the process in detail to appreciate how chemical energy in gasoline is transformed into mechanical energy in a motorcycle engine. 1. Intake stroke: The cycle begins when the piston in the engine moves down, which allows a mixture of fuel (gasoline) and air to be drawn into the cylinder.  2. Compression stroke: As the piston moves upwards, it compresses the fuel-air mixture, which increases its potential energy. 3. Power stroke (combustion phase): The spark plug ignites the compressed fuel-air mixture. This ignition causes the gasoline to combust, resulting in a mini explosion. The chemical energy stored in the gasoline is released in the form of heat and light, thus transforming into thermal energy. 4. Expansion: The explosion from the combustion drastically increases the gas pressure in the cylinder, which forces the piston to move down. This movement of the piston transforms the thermal energy into mechanical energy, which is then used to move the crankshaft connected to the wheels of the motorcycle, making the bike move forward. 5. Exhaust Stroke: After the power stroke, the piston moves up again, pushing the exhaust gases (a by-product of combustion) out of the cylinder. 6. The cycle repeats with a new intake of gasoline and air mixture, thus continuing the transformation of chemical energy into mechanical energy. So, amongst the options given -- chemical, nuclear, magnetic, and electrical energy -- it's the chemical energy in gasoline that is converted into mechanical energy in a motorcycle engine. Nuclear energy is not involved in such small-scale combustions, magnetic energy does not play a direct role in the energy conversion in this case, and electrical energy is used mainly for creating sparks via the spark plug for combustion and to operate other electrical components of a motorcycle."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Hostilities emerged when, in 1867, Bahrain arrested a Qatari Bedouin in the Qatari mainland and deported him to Bahrain. In response, the Qataris, led by the Naim tribe, defeated the Bahraini army that was based on the peninsula, effectively expelling them. These tensions led Bahrain, allied with Abu Dhabi, to attack Qatar. The conflict failed to pacify and resulted in an escalation between the two parties in the following year. In October 1867, the Bahraini Hakim Mohammed al Khalifa, sent his brother, Ali Al Khalifa, with a force of 500 men in 24 boats to attack Qatar. He was joined by a force of 200 men under Ahmed al Khalifa. Additionally, Bahrain's ally Abu Dhabi sent 2,000 troops in 70 boats. The attack on Qatar led to the sacking of Bida  and Wakra. A British record later stated \\"that the towns of Doha and Wakrah were, at the end of 1867 temporarily blotted out of existence, the houses being dismantled and the inhabitants deported\\". A Qatari counterattack followed the next year, resulting in the destruction of most of the Bahraini naval vessels deployed. The 1868 attack resulted in some 1,000 individuals killed and 60 ships destroyed. Based on the above article, answer a question.

Opponents of racial affirmative action argue that the program actually benefits middle- and upper-class African Americans and Hispanic Americans at the expense of lower-class European Americans and Asian Americans. This argument supports the idea of class-based affirmative action. America's poor is disproportionately made up of people of color, so class-based affirmative action would disproportionately help people of color.

The original sentence provided only states that a memorial, the Lorelei Fountain, was created in tribute to Heinrich Heine and is based on one of his well-known works from 1838. To answer the question of when Heinrich Heine died, a little more context and information is required. Heinrich Heine was a renowned German poet, journalist, and literary critic. He was born on December 13, 1797, in Düsseldorf, Germany, and his writings are remembered for their lyricism and wit. His poetry and prose were influential in shaping German literature in the 19th century, as well as furthering the Romantic movement. Heine's life was marked with political and social controversy, as he was an outspoken advocate for political and artistic freedom. Many of his writings centered on themes of individuality, freedom, and love. He was of Jewish origin, and although he later converted to Protestantism, his heritage led to persecution and censorship during his lifetime. This also resulted in his works being targeted by the Nazis in the following century. Heinrich Heine's health began to decline in the mid-1840s, and he eventually suffered from what is now believed to be a form of multiple sclerosis. As his health worsened, he became bedridden and dependent on his wife and friends for care. He continued to write until near the end of his life, though the quality of his later works is regarded as inferior to his earlier compositions. Heine died on February 17, 1856, in Paris, France. His death came after years of suffering from his debilitating illness. In accordance with his wishes, Heine was buried at the Montmartre Cemetery in Paris. His grave is inscribed with a line from one of his own poems: \\"Wo man begräbt den Dichter dort / Entsteht aus seinem Grabe Hort\\" (Where one buries the poet there / Springs from his grave a treasure). This engraving speaks to the lasting legacy of his works and the idea that a poet's true value is revealed after their death."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Review: peter mattei 's love in the time of money sets itself apart by forming a chain of relationships that come full circle to end on a positive ( if tragic ) note  Is this movie review sentence negative or positive?","output":"The movie review sentence for Peter Mattei's \\"Love in the Time of Money\\" can be considered a mix of both positive and negative elements.  On the positive side, the review points out that the film sets itself apart from others, suggesting that it has a unique or original quality to it. The reviewer also mentions that the film's chain of relationships comes full circle, which implies that the plot is well-designed and thought-out. Additionally, the mention of a positive ending, despite being tragic, shows appreciation for the emotional impact that the film has on its audience. However, there are also negative aspects in this review. The mention of a tragic ending indicates that the film has a somber or potentially upsetting conclusion. This can be seen as a negative point, depending on the viewer's preferences. The fact that the positive note comes with a tragic specification creates a sense of mixed feelings about the movie's resolution.

Banned: Asma al-Assad, can no longer travel or shop in the EU comes as diplomats try to crank up pressure on her husband to end a bloody crackdown on popular unrest. Her days of shopping in the EU for the president's palace are over, as ministers have decided the wife of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is no longer welcome. The ban on travel and shopping in the EU, will come as a blow to Asma  al-Assad, whose love of pricey purchases has been well documented in the past few weeks in leaked emails. They detailed Asma placing an order for £10,000 worth of candlesticks, concern over getting hold of a new chocolate fondue set from Amazon, and swapping details with friends of crystal-encrusted designer shoes costing nearly £4,000. The announcement comes as diplomats try to crank up pressure on his government to end a bloody crackdown on popular unrest. Her name is now among 12 people added to the sanctions list, which already includes her husband. The list will be released over the weekend, but diplomats confirmed the list includes Mr. Assad's mother, sister as well. They said that Mr. Assad's 36-year-old wife would be subject to the EU's asset freeze and banned from traveling to all EU member states except the U.K. British authorities will decide whether they prevent her entering the country and a U.K. diplomat said it is premature for a decision on the issue. Speaking ahead of a meeting of EU foreign ministers in Brussels, EU's foreign policy chief, Baroness Ashton, said sanctions were ''a really important tool.' UK Foreign Secretary William Hague said it was 'very important to increase the pressure on the Syrian regime.' A British-born former investment. banker who had once cultivated an image of a woman inspired by Western. values, Asma al-Assad has become a hate figure for many Syrians. Crackdown: A British-born former investment, Asma al-Assad has become a hate figure for many Syrians.

She. has stood by her husband during a year-long crackdown on popular unrest. in which the U.N. says at least 8,000 people have died. Last week activists released some 3,000 emails they said were from private accounts belonging to Mr Assad and his wife. The messages, which have not been independently verified, suggested Mrs Assad continued to shop online for luxury goods. while Syria descended into bloodshed. She comes across as a shallow. ingenue, focused on internet shopping rather than the horrific plight of. the people she professes to care for. The EU has. responded to Syria's violence with a broad range of sanctions, which. include a ban on Syrian oil imports to Europe and measures against the. Syrian central bank and other companies and state institutions. Foreign. ministers of EU member states are set to agree on a new round of. measures, the bloc's 13th, and impose asset freezes and bans on travel. to the EU against 12 people, include Asma. Policy: Speaking ahead of the meeting of foreign ministers in Brussels, EU's foreign policy chief, Baroness Ashton, said sanctions were 'a really important tool' Agreement: William Hague, British Foreign Secretary, shakes the hand of Jose Manuel Garcia Margallo, Spanish Foreign Minister, at the start of a Foreign Affairs Council meeting at the European Council headquarters in Brussels, Belgium today. A prohibition for European companies to do business with two more Syrian entities is also planned. 'The. text (of sanctions) has gone through,' said one EU diplomat, referring. to an agreement reached by EU envoys in Brussels to a list of new. sanctions. Another diplomat confirmed Assad's wife is included in the. list of sanctioned individuals. The list still needs formal approval. from ministers. It will become public on Saturday when new sanctions are. due to go into effect. Assad himself has been a target since May last year, but sanctions have had little impact on his policies so far. Fighting: A Syrian woman, kisses a soldier from the Free Syrian Army yesterday in front of a destroyed Syrian army forces tank which was attacked during clashes between the Syrian government forces and the Syrian rebels, in Homs. Destruction: A house is destroyed by Syrian government shelling in Rastan town in Homs - the U.N. says at least 8,000 people have died during the crackdown on violence. Violence has intensified in recent weeks as pro-government forces bombard rebel towns and villages, looking to sweep their lightly armed opponents out of their strongholds. The international community has struggled to formulate a joint approach in the face of opposition from Russia and China to any resolution by the U.N. Security Council. Assad absorbed a major diplomatic blow on Wednesday, however, when Russia and China joined the Security Council in voicing support for U.N.-Arab League envoy Kofi Annan's bid to end violence that has brought Syria to the brink of civil war. Asma Assad. Asma Assad, 36, (pictured) grew up in Acton, West London where she was known as 'Emma'. She is the daughter of consultant cardiologist Fawaz Akhras and retired diplomat Sahar Otri, both Sunni Muslims. Her parents moved from Syria to London in the Fifties so that her father, who is now based at the Cromwell Hospital and in Harley Street, could get the best possible education and medical training. Asma, who holds dual citizenship,. British and Syrian, was educated at a Church of England school in Ealing. before attending a private girls’ day school - Queen’s College, Harley. Street. From Queen’s,. where she achieved four A-levels, Asma went to King’s College London to. read Computer Science and take a diploma in French Literature. She. graduated with a First and, after six months of travelling, joined. Deutsche Bank as an analyst in hedge-fund management.

Jefferson Reed is a mild-mannered school teacher in Washington, D.C. His neighborhood is terrorized by a local gang called The Golden Lords, led by  Simon Caine and allied with drug lord Anthony Byers. One night, Jeff steps in to rescue a woman from the gang only to end up running from them himself. Hiding in a garbage dumpster, he manages to escape. As he climbs out, he is struck down by a glowing, green meteorite. His spine is crushed and he receives severe burns. A small fragment of the meteor was left over and taken by a vagrant named Marvin. Reed awakens several days later in the hospital, but when his bandages are taken off, he is miraculously healed of all injuries. Jeff soon discovered that the meteorite had left him with spectacular abilities such as flight, x-ray/laser vision, superhuman strength, speed, and hearing, invulnerability, healing powers, the ability to absorb a book's content by touch, super breath, telepathy with dogs (which he uses to communicate with his own dog, Ellington), and telekinesis.

Many people think that in the future computers will be used a lot in everyday's life. It is thought that we won't have to go shopping because we will be able to get most things which are sold in shops on the Internet. There will be fewer books because we will be able to get all texts from computers. The Internet will be used to play games, see films and buy food. Most telephone calls will be made by computers, too. Some people are glad about these new ways of shopping and communicating . Others do not think that computers will replace  our old ways. Let's take books for example. Some people think that one day we won't read books made of paper. Instead, we will buy and read books using computers. We will read texts on small pocket computers. The computers will keep many different books in them at the same time. We won't need to turn lots of pages and paper will be saved. Computerized books will be used more and more. Is Internet shopping such a pleasure as going to the shop? Many people say it is not. It is a pleasure to go into shops and look at things you want to buy. It is also unlikely  that many people will want to read large texts on our computers. Because paper books will perhaps be more friendly. Maybe computers won't change these two habits .

What is the last name of the person that helps the park ranger find the naturalist in an animal skin?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  The film opens with military veteran helicopter pilot and guide Don Stober flying individuals above the trees of a vast national park. He states that the woods are untouched and remain much as they did during the time when Native Americans lived there. Two female hikers are breaking camp when they are suddenly attacked and killed by an unseen animal. The national park's chief ranger, Michael Kelly, and photographer Allison Corwin, daughter of the park's restaurant owner, decide to follow a ranger to the primitive campsite to check on the female hikers. There, they discover the mangled corpses of the two girls, one of which has been partially buried. At the hospital, a doctor tells Kelly that the girls were killed by a bear. The park supervisor, Charley Kittridge, blames Kelly for the attacks, saying that the bears were supposed to have been moved from the park by Kelly and naturalist Arthur Scott before the tourist season began. Kelly and Kittridge argue over closing the park, before deciding to move all hikers off the park's mountain while allowing campers to remain in the lowlands. Kelly calls Scott, who tells him that all of the bears are accounted for and this specific bear must be unknown to the forest. During a search of the mountain, a female ranger stops for a break at a waterfall. Deciding to soak her feet, she is unaware that the bear is lurking under the falls, and she is attacked and killed. Kelly recruits the helicopter pilot, Stober, to assist in the search. Flying above the forest, they see what they believe to be an animal, only to discover the naturalist Scott adorned in an animal skin while tracking the bear. He informs them that the animal they are looking for is a prehistoric grizzly bear (a fictional Pleistocene-era Arctodus ursos horribilis) standing at least 15 feet tall and weighing 2,000 pounds. Kelly and Stober scoff at the notion.","output":"In the context you provided, the last name of the person that helps the park ranger find the naturalist in an animal skin is Stober.

Q: Abstract: Early local tumor invasion in breast cancer results in a likely encounter between cancer cells and mature adipocytes, but the role of these fat cells in tumor progression remains unclear. We show that murine and human tumor cells cocultivated with mature adipocytes exhibit increased invasive capacities in vitro and in vivo, using an original two-dimensional coculture system. Likewise, adipocytes cultivated with cancer cells also exhibit an altered phenotype in terms of delipidation and decreased adipocyte markers associated with the occurrence of an activated state characterized by overexpression of proteases, including matrix metalloproteinase-11, and proinflammatory cytokines [interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1β]. In the case of IL-6, we show that it plays a key role in the acquired proinvasive effect by tumor cells. Equally important, we confirm the presence of these modified adipocytes in human breast tumors by immunohistochemistry and quantitative PCR. Interestingly, the tumors of larger size and/or with lymph nodes involvement exhibit the higher levels of IL-6 in tumor surrounding adipocytes. Collectively, all our data provide in vitro and in vivo evidence that (i) invasive cancer cells dramatically impact surrounding adipocytes; (ii) peritumoral adipocytes exhibit a modified phenotype and specific biological features sufficient to be named cancer-associated adipocytes (CAA); and (iii) CAAs modify the cancer cell characteristics/phenotype leading to a more aggressive behavior. Our results strongly support the innovative concept that adipocytes participate in a highly complex vicious cycle orchestrated by cancer cells to promote tumor progression that might be amplified in obese patients..

Write an article based on this summary: Two new studies confirm that multiple exploding stars, called supernovae, have showered the Earth with radiation within the last few million years.","output":"Title: Recent Studies Reveal Supernovae Showered Earth with Radiation Within the Past Few Million Years  Introduction A supernova is a massive, energetic explosion of a star that occurs at the end of its life cycle. These extraordinary astral events not only produce brilliant light displays, but also release vast amounts of energy, radiation, and cosmic particles. Intriguingly, scientists have discovered that multiple supernovae have showered the Earth with radiation within the last few million years. Body Two groundbreaking studies have recently confirmed that the Earth has experienced multiple instances of radiation bombardment from the explosion of nearby stars known as supernovae. The findings of these studies offer significant insights into the effects of supernovae on our planet and its environment. 1. Study methodology The two studies each employed a distinct methodology to arrive at their conclusions. The first study analyzed iron-60 isotopes discovered in ocean sediments and ice cores from the Antarctic. Iron-60 is an isotope with a half-life of 2.6 million years and primarily originates from supernovae events. By examining the concentration and distribution of iron-60, researchers were able to deduce the occurrence of supernovae and their impact on Earth in the past. The second study utilized a combination of data from spacecraft and computer simulations to calculate the trajectory of cosmic rays produced by a supernova. This allowed scientists to determine the paths taken by these high-energy particles, as well as their subsequent interaction with the Earth's atmosphere. 2. Timeline of supernova events Combining the findings of both studies, researchers were able to confirm that the Earth has been exposed to radiation from multiple supernovae within the past few million years. Notably, the studies suggest that one such event took place approximately 2.5 million years ago and another more recently, with estimated radiation levels twice those of today's background cosmic radiation. 3. Implications of supernovae on Earth The exposure of Earth to radiation from supernovae has potentially far-reaching consequences for our planet and its environment. High levels of radiation may cause significant ecological disruption, mutations, and extinction events. Moreover, the energy produced by supernovae could have a profound impact on the Earth's climate and overall atmospheric conditions, possibly contributing to major climatic shifts over time. Conclusion The studies' findings that multiple supernovae have showered the Earth with radiation within recent geological time contribute immensely to our understanding of the effects of these cataclysmic events on our planet. Future research will continue to explore the consequences of supernovae on Earth and help unravel the mysteries surrounding these powerful phenomena."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","output":"Marie Curie, a renowned Polish-born physicist and chemist, named the element Polonium (Po) after her native land, Poland. Not only was she a trailblazer in radioactivity research, but she also broke numerous barriers for women in science. Curie discovered Polonium as well as another element, Radium (Ra), both of which played a crucial role in the development of modern science and technology. Born as Maria Skłodowska in 1867 in Warsaw, Poland, she later moved to Paris to pursue higher education, as women were not allowed to attend university in Poland during that time. In Paris, she enrolled at the Sorbonne University, where she met and married her husband Pierre Curie. Together, they conducted groundbreaking research with significant impacts on the scientific community. The discovery of Polonium occurred in 1898 while Marie Curie was studying the radioactive properties of the mineral pitchblende. Pitchblende, an ore primarily composed of uranium oxide, exhibited higher levels of radioactivity than the uranium content alone could explain. Intrigued by this discrepancy, the Curies developed an analytical process to investigate the presence of any additional radioactive elements in the ore. Through a series of laborious and time-consuming chemical separation procedures, Marie Curie was able to isolate two new radioactive elements – Radium and Polonium. The choice of the name Polonium was a tribute to her homeland, Poland, which at that time was not an independent country. By naming the element after her native country, she aimed to draw attention to the struggles and scientific accomplishments of the Polish people. Polonium is a very rare and highly radioactive metal with the atomic number 84, characterized by its silvery appearance. It has several isotopes, with Polonium-210 being the most prominent. Polonium-210 is a known alpha particle emitter, meaning it releases alpha particles during radioactive decay. Due to its high radioactivity, Polonium has limited practical applications but has been used in specialized research environments, such as nuclear physics and various industrial processes. Marie Curie's determination and hard work in discovering Polonium and Radium laid the foundation for understanding radioactivity and its properties. This ultimately paved the way for significant developments like the establishment of radiography in medical diagnosis, the creation of radiotherapy for cancer treatment, and the harnessing of nuclear energy.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the last name of the person who found the key to Bernie's safe deposit box?  Larry Wilson and Richard Parker are at a Manhattan morgue where they see their deceased CEO Bernie Lomax. Larry falsely claims Bernie as his uncle, so he can get some of Bernie's possessions including Bernie's credit card. At the insurance company, Larry and Richard are quizzed by their boss and Arthur Hummel, the company's internal investigator, who ask the two if they have the US2 million that Bernie embezzled. They deny knowing where the money is, but their boss believes they're lying and fires them. He also sends Hummel after them, giving him two weeks to prove their guilt. Over dinner (paid for with Bernie's credit card, in one of its many uses), Larry tells Richard he found a key to a safe deposit box in St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands and asks Richard if he will use the computer at work to see if the 2 million is in Bernie's account. At first Richard refuses but ultimately gives in. Meanwhile, in the Virgin Islands, a voodoo queen named Mobu is hired by mobsters to find the money Bernie stole. She sends two servants—Henry and Charles (Tom Wright)—to go to New York, get Bernie's body, use a voodoo ceremony to reanimate him, and bring him back to her so he can lead her to the money. Their attempts to bring Bernie back are plagued by accidents. They prepare in a bathroom at a sleazy porno theater for the voodoo ceremony, but having lost the sacrificial chicken, they use a pigeon instead. This limits Bernie's ability to walk toward the hidden money: he only moves when he hears music. At the 42nd St-Grand Central subway station, Henry and Charles soon abandon him to chase a man who stole their boombox. The answer to this question is:","output":"Wilson. Larry Wilson found the key to Bernie's safe deposit box."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Some types of pine trees used for landscaping include white pine, jack pine and Scotch pine. Ask the seller about growing environments if you live in a different climate or at a different elevation than the location where the seedling was grown. Bare-root pine seedlings must be planted during the late fall and winter, when pine trees are dormant. Container-grown seedlings can be planted at any time, although the hottest summer months will require additional shade and water to prevent dehydration and sun damage. Most seedlings can be kept for several weeks between 35º and 38º F (1.7 – 3.3ºC), but you should check with the seller in case the species you bought has different requirements. Keep the roots damp until you are ready to plant, but refrain from soaking them in water, which could kill them. If the roots form a dense ball, or circle the sides the of the container, carefully rearrange the main root branches so they are more spread out. Some seedlings are sold with a small amount of soil mixture packed around the roots. Try to keep as much of this on the roots as possible while rearranging. Each pine tree should have plenty of open space, with no small plants around its base and no root systems of other trees nearby. Choose a location where the tree will receive direct sunlight during the cooler parts of the day.  If you cannot plant a pine tree somewhere with shade on its west side, instructions are included below for creating a sun shade. A mix of sand and loam is best for pine trees, but you should only need to mix in suitable organic mulch such as sphagnum if the soil is a hard clay consistency.  Choose an area with well-draining soil. A 1 foot (30 cm) deep hole filled with water should drain easily within 12 hours. If it does not, you may need to install drainage. Do not plant trees when conditions are windy, dry, or above 85ºF (30ºC). The soil should not have standing water or ice on the day you plant, but should not be parched either. The top layer of soil is the highest quality, so fill the bottom few inches (about 10 cm) with topsoil after you dig your hole. Be sure to dig the hole large enough that the roots still fit after you've added the topsoil.   Warning: Contact your utility company to discover the location of underground lines before digging any large holes. Try to plant the tree to the same level it was planted in the nursery. If you're unsure, it is better to plant the tree too high than too low. If you’re planting more than one pine tree, be sure to leave at least 10 to 12 feet (3 to 4 m) of spacing so they can grow to mature width without any obstruction. Some varieties of pine may need even more space, like the huge Austrian pine. Although burlap and other biodegradable material can be left on the plant, carefully removing it gives the seedling a better opportunity for growth. Fill the hole again after planting, periodically patting down loose soil with your shovel handle, not with your feet. Fill the hole until it is level with the surrounding soil, or slightly lower if the climate is especially dry, so water can run into the roots. Have an assistant hold the tree upright while you fill the hole if necessary. . Staking pine tree seedlings is only necessary in areas of unusually high wind. If you think the pine tree is in danger of blowing over, use one or two stakes attached by ties or straps, and leave enough room for the tree to sway. Do not loop wire directly over the tree. You may need to provide a sunscreen for your small pine tree by using a tarp or sheet of painted plywood. Planting where there is shade from another tree or a building is also a practical choice. The shade should be on the west side of the tree, which is where the sun is located during the hottest parts of the day.","output":"This article discusses selecting, planting and caring for pine tree seedlings, with specific tips on ideal growing environments, planting timeframes, soil preparation, spacing requirements, and sun protection to ensure the healthy growth and development of pine trees in landscaping."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: \\"Outtakes Vol 1\\", given a list of categories: company, educational institution, artist, athlete, office holder, mean of transportation, building, natural place, village, animal, plant, album, film or written work, what category does the title belong to?

Truman gave the go-ahead to build the hydrogen bomb, also known as the H-bomb or thermonuclear bomb, on January 31, 1950. The decision to develop this powerful weapon was made during the early years of the Cold War, an era marked by an escalating arms race between the United States and the Soviet Union. Truman's decision was primarily driven by a desire to maintain the United States' military and technological superiority. The H-bomb would become an essential aspect of the United States' nuclear arsenal during the decades that followed. The hydrogen bomb was a significant advancement in nuclear weapon technology. It was designed to be many times more powerful than the atomic bombs dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945. The H-bomb relies on nuclear fusion instead of fission, which is the process used in atomic bombs. The fusion method involves merging atomic nuclei, resulting in an immense release of energy. Truman's decision to authorize the H-bomb development was influenced by several factors. Firstly, the Soviet Union had successfully detonated its first atomic bomb on August 29, 1949, an event known as \\"First Lightning.\\" The American monopoly on nuclear weapons had come to an end, and a desire to maintain a technological advantage over the Soviets became essential for US national security. Secondly, prominent American scientists and policymakers like Edward Teller and Ernest O. Lawrence strongly advocated for the development of the hydrogen bomb. They argued that it was crucial to ensure the United States' security and maintain a strong nuclear deterrent against potential Soviet aggression. Additionally, the international political landscape further contributed to Truman's decision to pursue the H-bomb. The relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union had become increasingly hostile in the years following World War II. Conflicting political ideologies, mutual mistrust, and an international power struggle made the development of powerful weapons like the H-bomb seem more necessary. The United States began constructing its first hydrogen bomb under a top-secret project codenamed \\"Project Ivy.\\" On November 1, 1952, the US conducted its first successful H-bomb test, known as \\"Ivy Mike,\\" on the Enewetak Atoll in the Marshall Islands. The explosion was approximately 500 times more powerful than the atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima. Subsequently, the Soviet Union would also develop its own hydrogen bomb, conducting its first successful test in August 1953. Ultimately, Truman's decision to proceed with the development of the hydrogen bomb played a pivotal role in shaping the strategic environment during the Cold War. By authorizing the creation of a more powerful weapon, the United States aimed to maintain its position of power and deter potential threats from the Soviet Union. The hydrogen bomb was a significant step in the nuclear arms race, with both superpowers vying for supremacy and developing ever more destructive weapons."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

COMPASS is any of a family of macro assembly languages on Control Data Corporation's 3000 series, and on the 60-bit CDC 6000 series, 7600 and Cyber 70 and 170 series mainframe computers. While the architectures are very different, the macro and conditional assembly facilities are similar.  - West is one of the four cardinal directions or points of the compass. It is the opposite direction from east.  - Geography (from Greek , \\"geographia\\", literally \\"earth description\\") is a field of science devoted to the study of the lands, the features, the inhabitants, and the phenomena of Earth. The first person to use the word \\"\\" was Eratosthenes (276194 BC). Geography is an all-encompassing discipline that seeks an understanding of the Earth and its human and natural complexitiesnot merely where objects are, but how they have changed and come to be. It is often defined in terms of the two branches of human geography and physical geography. The four historical traditions in geographical research are: spatial analyses of natural and the human phenomena, area studies of places and regions, studies of human-land relationships, and the Earth sciences. Geography has been called \\"the world discipline\\" and \\"the bridge between the human and the physical sciences\\".  - Latin (Latin: ) is a classical language belonging to the Italic branch of the Indo-European languages. The Latin alphabet is derived from the Etruscan and Greek alphabets.  - Vulgar Latin or Sermo Vulgaris (\\"common speech\\") is a generic term for the \\"nonstandard\\" (as opposed to \\"classical\\") sociolects of Latin from which the Romance languages developed. Works written in Latin during classical times used Classical Latin rather than Vulgar Latin, with very few exceptions (most notably sections of Gaius Petronius' \\"Satyricon\\"). Because of its nonstandard nature, Vulgar Latin had no official orthography. Vulgar Latin is sometimes also called colloquial Latin, or Common Romance (particularly in the late stage). In Renaissance Latin, Vulgar Latin was called \\"vulgare Latinum\\" or \\"Latinum vulgare.\\"  - North is a noun, adjective, or adverb indicating direction or geography. North is one of the four cardinal directions or compass points. It is the opposite of south and is perpendicular to east and west.  - In elementary geometry, the property of being perpendicular (perpendicularity) is the relationship between two lines which meet at a right angle (90 degrees). The property extends to other related geometric objects.  - The Romance languages (sometimes called the Romanic languages, Latin languages, or Neo-Latin languages) are the modern languages that evolved from Vulgar Latin between the sixth and ninth centuries and that thus form a branch of the Italic languages within the Indo-European language family.  - A noun (from Latin \\"nmen\\", literally meaning \\"name\\") is a word that functions as the name of some specific thing or set of things, such as living creatures, objects, places, actions, qualities, states of existence, or ideas. Linguistically, a noun is a member of a large, open part of speech whose members can occur as the main word in the subject of a clause, the object of a verb, or the object of a preposition.  - The four cardinal directions or cardinal points are the directions of north, east, south, and west, commonly denoted by their initials: N, E, S, W. East and west are at right angles to north and south, with east being in the clockwise direction of rotation from north and west being directly opposite east. Intermediate points between the four cardinal directions form the points of the compass. The intermediate (intercardinal, or ordinal) directions are northeast (NE), southeast (SE), southwest (SW), and northwest (NW). Further, the intermediate direction of every set of intercardinal and cardinal direction is called a secondary-intercardinal direction, the eight shortest points in the compass rose to the right, i.e. NNE, ENE, ESE, and so on.  - In linguistics, an adjective (abbreviated ) is a describing word, the main syntactic role of which is to qualify a noun or noun phrase, giving more information about the object signified.  - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries.  - The Italic languages are a subfamily of the Indo-European language family, originally spoken by Italic peoples. They include Latin and its descendants (the Romance languages) as well as a number of extinct languages of the Italian Peninsula, including Umbrian, Oscan, Faliscan and South Picene.  - East is one of the four cardinal directions or points of the compass. It is the opposite direction from west.  - South is a noun, adjective, or adverb indicating direction or geography. It is one of the four cardinal directions or compass points. South is the polar opposite of north and is perpendicular to east and west.  - Septentrional , meaning \`\` of the north '' , is a word rarely used in English , but is commonly used in Latin and in the Romance languages . The term septentrional usually is found on maps , mostly those made before 1700 . Early maps of North America often refer to the northern - and northwestern-most unexplored areas of the continent as at the \`\` Septentrional '' and as \`\` America Septentrionalis '' , sometimes with slightly varying spellings . Moreover , the term septentrional , is the adjectival form of the Latin noun septentrion , which refers to the seven stars of the Big Dipper asterism , the Septentrion .  - An adverb is a word that modifies a verb, adjective, another adverb, determiner, noun phrase, clause, or sentence. Adverbs typically express manner, place, time, frequency, degree, level of certainty, etc., answering questions such as \\"how?\\", \\"in what way?\\", \\"when?\\", \\"where?\\", and \\"to what extent?\\". This function is called the adverbial function, and may be realised by single words (adverbs) or by multi-word expressions (adverbial phrases and adverbial clauses).    What object entity has the relation of 'instance of' with the subject 'septentrional'?   Choices: - acronym  - adjective  - adverb  - alphabet  - angle  - branch  - bridge  - compass  - concept  - continent  - description  - direction  - eight  - extinct  - family  - four  - frequency  - geographical  - geography  - language  - language family  - mediterranean sea  - member  - name  - object  - ocean  - official  - orthography  - part  - property  - relationship  - river  - role  - romance  - science  - sea  - series  - set  - speech  - study  - two  - word Answer:","output":"adjective"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. Normal practice when handling ancient artifacts is to move carefully and minimize any sudden movements. Shaking the object is definitely not encouraged. But that’s exactly what we—a group of museum curators and conservators—did when this exquisite Greek black-glazed kantharos (wine cup) was temporarily removed from display during the reinstallation of the Getty Museum’s antiquities collection at the Getty Villa. One of just a handful of “rattling cups” that survive from the fifth and fourth centuries B.C., we wanted to learn more about how it was made.(1) Although we were eager to find out what was below the surface of the cup, we started by examining its exterior. The kantharos’s distinctive shape, with profiled lip, tall foot, and elegant, upward-sweeping handles, is characteristic of black-glazed pottery made in the second half of the fourth century B.C., and replicates the form of luxury vessels in metal. Although the cup is currently catalogued as South Italian, the shape—and its striking decoration—are also typical of Athenian manufacture, and it may in fact have been produced there.(2) During the fourth century B.C., Athenian pottery was both imported into southern Italy and imitated by local craftsmen. The best South Italian versions were meant to be difficult to distinguish from Athenian examples, and we are continuing to investigate where ours may have been made. A Greek inscription applied in gilt around the rim reads: ΚΑΣΤΟΡΠΟΛΥΔΕΥΙΚΕΣ (“KASTORPOLYDEUIKES”). Kastor and Polydeukes were twin sons of Zeus—known together as the Dioskouroi—and were worshipped as protectors of sailors, horsemen, and chariot racing.(3) The inscription indicates that the kantharos was dedicated to them, perhaps as thanks for—or in hope of—safe passage at sea or a successful race. The gold decoration supports this idea: because each brother split his time between Mt. Olympus and Hades, they were often represented by stars, depicted here beneath the cup’s rim. Further, the wreath, garlands, and bucrania (skulls of... According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

We open with a saucer shaped spacecraft drifting across a star filled sky. It stops and hovers, ejects a small sphere which heads to Earth. On a lonely highway at night a truck approaches. The driver, McCrary (Kenneth Alton) smokes and whistles to a tune playing on the radio. Suddenly his radio experiences interference, all of the truck instruments malfunction, and the truck engine quits. He exits the vehicle to check the engine. The sphere loitering nearby transforms into light and electrical energy and possesses McCrary. He gets back in his truck and drives to Lab Central, a government installation. A guard prevents his entrance. McCrary tells the guard he is lost. Distracting the guard, McCrary knocks the guard out with a monkey wrench. He walks into the main building and enters the office of Dr. Hubbell Eliot. Dr. Eliot (John Emery) challenges him asking, \\"Who are you? What are you doing here? You have no business here.

The ambiance was a perfect blend of elegance and comfort, making it an ideal spot for both special occasions and casual gatherings. Our server, Jessica, was nothing short of phenomenal. She was attentive, knowledgeable, and had a contagious enthusiasm that made the dining experience even more enjoyable. She expertly guided us through the menu, answering our questions about ingredients, and offering recommendations based on our taste preferences. We decided to start with the Zesty Crab Cakes and the Mixed Green Salad, both of which were prepared to perfection. The crab cakes were delicately crispy on the outside and bursting with flavor on the inside, beautifully complemented by the tangy lemon aioli. The salad was a refreshing medley of locally sourced greens and heirloom tomatoes, all dressed in an addictively delicious honey-ginger vinaigrette. For our main courses, I chose the Herb-Crusted Salmon, and my partner went for the famous Truffle Porcini Risotto. Let me just say – WOW. The salmon was cooked flawlessly, with the most delectable flaky texture, while still retaining its juices. The risotto, rich in its truffle aroma, had a beautifully creamy consistency, generously scattered with tender porcini mushrooms – a true game-changer! To top off the evening, Jessica recommended that we try their signature Chocolate Lava Cake, served with a scoop of vanilla bean ice-cream. The molten center of the cake was sinfully good, and we could not resist finishing every last bite! The wine selection at \\"Flavors of Paradise\\" further enhanced our meal. With a vast array of options from around the world, we opted for a delightful 2017 Pinot Noir, the perfect accompaniment to our exquisite dinner.

Within the blue circle is a white band with the national motto inscribed on it. The motto on the Brazilian flag is \\"Ordem e Progresso,\\" which in English translates to \\"Order and Progress.\\" This phrase is derived from Auguste Comte's motto of Positivism, which is \\"L'amour pour principe et l'ordre pour base; le progrès pour but\\" – in English, this means, \\"Love as a principle and order as the basis; progress as the goal.\\" The Brazilian flag was designed by a group of Brazilian artists and intellectuals, and it was adopted as the national flag on November 19, 1889, just a few days after the declaration of the Republic of Brazil on November 15, 1889. The colors and elements on the flag symbolize various aspects of Brazil's history, culture, and geography. The green field represents the House of Braganza, which was the family of Dom Pedro I, the first Emperor of Brazil. The yellow diamond represents the House of Habsburg, which was the family of Empress Maria Leopoldina of Austria, the wife of Dom Pedro I. The blue circle and the stars symbolize the sky over Brazil on the night of November 15, 1889, and the 27 stars represent the 26 states of Brazil and the Federal District. The flag's design has undergone a few modifications over time, primarily to accommodate the addition of new states. The current version of the flag with its 27 stars was adopted on May 11, 1992, when the number of states in Brazil increased. In summary, the phrase \\"Ordem e Progresso\\" on the Brazilian flag reflects the country's commitment to maintaining order and striving towards progress, inspired by the principles of Positivism. The flag as a whole symbolizes Brazil's rich history, culture, and natural beauty, while also expressing the nation's aspirations for a brighter future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Under U.S. law, all top government officials are required to file annual financial disclosure documents with the agency. In Tuesday's 92-page filing, Trump acknowledged that he'd reimbursed his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, last year for more than 100,000 for unspecified expenses incurred in 2016. Trump’s lawyers have previously said the president reimbursed Cohen for 130,000 that Cohen paid to an adult film star to keep her quiet about a sexual tryst she said she had with Trump 10 years earlier. Trump has denied having the tryst but recently confirmed reimbursing Cohen to stop “false and extortionist accusations” about it. The financial disclosure did not say why Trump had not listed the payment in his previous financial filing, but the ethics agency said the reimbursement constituted a loan that should have been reported. That has set off a firestorm of criticism and calls for an investigation into whether Trump violated federal law by omitting the payment from his 2017 disclosure. The controversy has overshadowed other details in Trump's financial disclosure, which is the only publicly available snapshot into the president's finances — his debts, assets and income from dozens of companies and partnerships around the world. Here are six noteworthy takeaways from the report: Golf losses. Trump, an avid golfer who frequently visits his golf courses, sometimes in the company of world leaders, listed 17 golf companies in his disclosure form, with 13 reporting losses. Overall, golf-related revenue plunged to 210 million from nearly 300 million from the previous reporting period. However, the president's struggling golf courses in Turnberry, Scotland, and Doonbeg, Ireland, improved their earnings, with income at the Turnberry property growing to more than 20 million from 14 million. Trump plans to travel to Scotland during his visit to Britain this summer. Why did Trump file an annual financial disclosure form with the Office of Government Ethics? - to stop false accusations against him for his financial dealings - it is prerequisite to running for the office of President - not enough information - it is required of all top government officials under US law A:","output":"It is required of all top government officials under US law."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

DeLay was known to \\"primary\\" Republicans who resisted his votes (i.e., to threaten to endorse and to support a Republican primary challenge to the disobedient representative), and, like many of his predecessors in Congress, used promises of future committee chairmanships to bargain for support among the rank-and-file members of the party. Employing a method known as \\"catch and release\\", DeLay allowed centrist or moderately conservative Republicans to take turns voting against controversial bills. If a representative said that a bill was unpopular in his district, then DeLay would ask him to vote for it only if his vote were necessary for passage; if his vote were not needed, then the representative would be able to vote against the party without reprisal, a practice which has been followed by other party leaders and whips from both sides of the aisle, Democrat and Republican, respectively, when in power.  In the 108th Congress, a preliminary Medicare vote passed 216-215, a vote on Head Start passed 217-216, a vote on school vouchers for Washington, D.C., passed 209-208, and \\"Fast track\\", usually called \\"trade promotion authority\\", passed by one vote as well. Both political supporters and opponents remarked on DeLay's ability to sway the votes of his party, a method DeLay described as \\"growing the vote\\". DeLay was noted for involving lobbyists in the process of passing House bills. One lobbyist said, \\"I've had members pull me aside and ask me to talk to another member of Congress about a bill or amendment, but I've never been asked to work on a bill--at least like they are asking us to whip bills now.\\" His ability to raise money gave him additional influence. During the 2004 election cycle, DeLay's political action committee ARMPAC was one of the top contributors to Republican congressional candidates, contributing over 980,000 in total.  Partly as a result of DeLay's management abilities, the House Republican caucus under him displayed unprecedented, sustained party cohesion.  On September 30, 2004, the House Ethics Committee unanimously admonished DeLay because he \\"offered to endorse Representative [Nick] Smith's son in exchange for Representative Smith's vote in favor of the Medicare bill.\\" Answer this question \\"What was he most known for?\\" by extracting the answer from the text above.","output":"DeLay was most known for his ability to sway the votes of his party and make them follow his decisions, like using \\"catch and release\\" method and involving lobbyists in the process of passing House bills.

What is the first name of the person who explains that musicians' girlfriends were routinely described as \\"chicks?\\"  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Many critics have noted the extraordinary development of Dylan's songwriting immediately after completing his first album. One of Dylan's biographers Clinton Heylin connects the sudden increase in lyrics written along topical and political lines to the fact that Dylan had moved into an apartment on West 4th Street with his girlfriend Suze Rotolo in January 1962. Rotolo's family had strong left-wing political commitments; both of her parents were members of the American Communist Party. Dylan acknowledged her influence when he told an interviewer: \\"Suze was into this equality-freedom thing long before I was. I checked out the songs with her.\\"Dylan's relationship with Rotolo also provided an important emotional dynamic in the composition of the Freewheelin' album. After six months of living with Dylan, Rotolo agreed to her mother's proposal that she travel to Italy to study art. Dylan missed her and wrote long letters to her conveying his hope that she would return soon to New York. She postponed her return several times, finally coming back in January 1963. Critics have connected the intense love songs expressing longing and loss on Freewheelin' to Dylan's fraught relationship with Rotolo. In her autobiography, Rotolo explains that musicians' girlfriends were routinely described as \\"chicks\\", and she resented being regarded as \\"a possession of Bob, who was the center of attention\\".The speed and facility with which Dylan wrote topical songs attracted the attention of other musicians in the New York folk scene. In a radio interview on WBAI in June 1962, Pete Seeger described Dylan as \\"the most prolific songwriter on the scene\\" and then asked Dylan how many songs he had written recently. Dylan replied, \\"I might go for two weeks without writing these songs. I write a lot of stuff. In fact, I wrote five songs last night but I gave all the papers away in some place called the Bitter End.\\" Dylan also expressed the impersonal idea that the songs were not his own creation.

It was released as the fifth single from their highly successful second studio album, \\"(What's the Story) Morning Glory?\\" in 1996. The song quickly became a fan-favorite and remains one of Oasis's most iconic tracks. Noel Gallagher has stated that he was inspired to write \\"Don't Look Back in Anger\\" after spending time in Paris with friends. The opening piano phrase is inspired by John Lennon's \\"Imagine\\" with Lennon being his idol. In fact, Gallagher memorably starts the song with the evocative line, \\"So, Sally can wait,\\" which is said to be a nod towards The Beatles' song \\"Sexy Sadie.\\" The song also features a melodic guitar solo paying tribute to George Harrison's signature style. Upon its release, \\"Don't Look Back in Anger\\" peaked at number one on the UK Singles Chart and contributed to the success of \\"(What's the Story) Morning Glory?\\". It has since become a staple of British popular music and an anthem for an entire generation. The song has received international recognition and continues to enjoy airplay on radio stations worldwide. Lyrically, \\"Don't Look Back in Anger\\" is a message of hope and reassurance. The song touches on themes of nostalgia and the importance of not dwelling on past events, focusing instead on positive aspects of life and moving forward. While its specific inspiration and meaning might remain somewhat ambiguous, \\"Don't Look Back in Anger\\" encourages listeners to embrace personal growth, let go of regret, and persevere through challenging times. In summary, Noel Gallagher of the band Oasis wrote \\"Don't Look Back in Anger,\\" a song that has become an anthem for resilience and positivity.

There are several elements in the text that suggest a negative sentiment. The first key word is \\"disaster,\\" which carries a strong negative connotation, implying that something undesirable or harmful must have happened. Moreover, the tweet refers to \\"hopefully last one of the night,\\" which indicates that the user has possibly experienced a series of negative events or \\"disasters\\" throughout the night and is expressing hope that things will get better from this point forward. Additionally, the tweet's ending, \\"just get me there safe!\\" communicates an urgent desire from the user for safety and security amidst their perceived troubles. This further supports the overall negative sentiment. Nevertheless, there is a slight hint of positivity due to the user's hopeful attitude for not encountering any more disasters.

This enthusiasm is further supported by their mention of watching the Jewish Slider Challenge on Man v. Food, which suggests that they already had an interest in the establishment even before visiting. Upon entering Chompie's, the reviewer felt like they were in a Jewish deli/bakery in New York. This demonstrates that the atmosphere and presentation of Chompie's met, or possibly exceeded, their expectations, and they enjoyed the authenticity of the place. Additionally, there is ample praise for the food, with the reviewer mentioning various desserts that they enjoyed as well as their repeated order of the Jewish sliders. The recommendation to order extra gravy for dipping shows that they found this feature particularly enjoyable.

Article: Try to have a pantry week once week a month, in which you do not do any grocery shopping and instead just rely on what's in your pantry.  Use leftovers, frozen food, and anything else you can find. You probably have more food than you realized sitting around. You can google recipes that only use the ingredients you have on hand that week. As previously stated, many websites offer you lists of suggestions if you type in the ingredients you have. Some foods can be frozen to increase their shelf life.  If a bread item you usually buy, like sourdough bread or bagels, goes on sale you can freeze loaves or packages to increase their shelf life. Bread can last about three months when frozen.  Most raw meats can be frozen to increase their shelf life. How long they last depends on the type of meat, but poultry, beef, and pork can last for months frozen.  If you're big on seafood, buy pre-frozen seafood in the store rather than fresh cuts. Not only does this cost less, you can stock up on sale items and leave them frozen for a few weeks or months before use. It's okay to buy expensive foods once in awhile. However, choose the items you splurge on wisely.  Certain foods may cost slightly more, but this is because they're healthier. Whole wheats, for example, are much healthier than processed wheats. This means you'll end up using less of these items as you'll feel fuller faster and for longer periods.  Some organic foods may actually fill you up more. You can experiment with going organic on certain items, usually wheat or grain-based foods, and see if you notice yourself eating less. If so, you might want to try swapping certain foods for the organic variety as you may end up spending less over time. What is a summary?","output":"A pantry week, held once a month, entails using only the stocked food items in your pantry instead of grocery shopping. This encourages the utilization of leftovers, frozen foods, and other stored ingredients. By searching for recipes based on available ingredients, meal planning becomes more efficient and reduces waste. Freezing bread, meat, and seafood can extend their shelf life, allowing you to buy in bulk during sales. Opting for expensive but healthier food items or organic options may prove cost-effective, as they can provide greater satiety and reduce overall consumption."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Question: Given the following context:  Gerald Clamson is a bank examiner who loves fishing on his annual two-week holiday.  Unfortunately, one day at the ocean he reels in Syd Valentine (also played by Lewis), an injured gangster in a scuba diving suit.  Syd tells Gerald about diamonds he has stolen from the other gangsters and hands him a map. Gerald escapes as frogmen from a yacht machine-gun the beach.  They swim ashore, locate Syd and gun him down. Their leader Thor ensures Syd's demise by firing a torpedo from his yacht that goes ashore, blowing a crater into the beach. As the police ignore Gerald's story, Gerald heads to the Hilton Inn in San Diego where Syd claimed the diamonds were hidden.  There he meets Suzie Cartwright, an airline stewardess.

Write some highlights for the following article: Springwood teenagers Dean, Kris, Jesse, Nancy and Quentin are having trouble not sleeping: They're knocking back coffee, popping pills, anything to delay another date with their dream stalker (which may explain why these high school students look like college grads). When one of them does drop off, the bedsheets turn red. Wes Craven's 1984 slumber party massacre started from scratch -- it was a low-budget item from what was then a genuine independent studio, New Line -- and became the iconic horror franchise of the decade. With his battered fedora, a striped sweater, a razor-glove and a face like Sal's Famous, Freddy Krueger was the most personable boogie man Hollywood had come up with in a long time, so what if he was also a child abuser? A recurring nightmare who stalked teenagers as they slept, Freddy preyed on the defenseless and played fast and loose with physics: If Salvador Dali had created a slasher movie villain, he might have come up with someone like Freddy. After eight movies, a TV series and a comic book, you might think Mr. Krueger had been done to death. It's been seven years since Freddy put Jason Vorhees in his place (in \\"Freddy vs Jason\\"). But you can't keep a good bad guy down, and at the rate Hollywood is cannibalizing its horror back catalogue, we'll be seeing remakes of the remakes any day now. Directed by pop video director Samuel Bayer and written by Wesley Strick and Eric Heisserer, the new \\"A Nightmare on Elm Street\\" is actually a lot like the old one. So much so, for a while you wonder why they didn't just re-release it. (You'll wish they had.) Surprisingly, Bayer doesn't go the Michael Bay route and give it a high-gloss, ADD tempo, but in duplicating the most memorable bits from the original (the glove in the bath, for instance, and the face coming through the wallpaper), he fails to put his own stamp on it. As Freddy, Jackie Earle Haley, who was Oscar nominated for playing a sex offender in \\"Little Children\\" (and who went on to play Rorschach in \\"Watchmen\\" and the battered psychopath Noyce in \\"Shutter Island\\") finds Robert Englund a tough act to follow. Haley drops his voice an octave and comes on heavy -- this Freddy mostly keeps his quips to himself -- but he's significantly shorter than Englund, and the make-up suggests nothing so much as Ray Bolger in \\"The Wizard of Oz\\": the scarecrow who didn't even scare the crows. iReporter gives new \\"Nightmare\\" an \\"A\\" Branching out tentatively toward something new, the film toys with repressed memory syndrome and the intriguing suggestion that maybe Freddy was innocent; that he has every right to be angry about the lynch mob that incinerated him. I'll leave you to imagine how far the filmmakers go with that radical notion, but maybe a prequel would have been a more rewarding way to go? The new \\"Nightmare\\" also proudly introduces a clinical-sounding term called \\"micro-naps,\\" a side effect of sleep deprivation that handily justifies more shock effects even as the number of survivors is whittled down to two (gratifyingly, they're the least synthetic of the young cast members). But is it scary? Barely. In the wake of \\"Paranormal Activity,\\" Freddy's grandstanding theatrics seem pretty old hat.

Answer the following question: Process: - Wind and water erode rocks - The wind and water pick up sediment that came off the rocks - Sediment is carried to an area by the wind, water, air, or ice - Sediment is deposited on the same spot many times - The sediment piles on top of other sediment for a long time - The sediment near the bottom is compressed by the weight of newer sediment - The sediment becomes sedimentary rock as it is pushed together by the heavy weight -   Question: suppose less sediment is carried away happens, how will it affect MORE sedimentary rock forming.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","output":"When less sediment is carried away, the rate at which sedimentary rocks form may be affected. The process of sedimentary rock formation involves the accumulation, compaction, and cementation of sediments. When less sediment is transported, it can have several possible effects on the formation of more sedimentary rocks. Firstly, less sediment being carried away could potentially lead to an increased rate of sedimentary rock formation. As sediment accumulates in a particular area due to reduced transportation, the rate of deposition of the sediment will be greater. As the layers of sediment pile up, the sediment near the bottom will experience increased pressure. This leads to faster compaction, ultimately resulting in the more rapid formation of sedimentary rocks. However, there are other factors that can influence the rate of sedimentary rock formation. For instance, the nature of the sediment itself plays a crucial role in determining how well the sediment can accumulate and compact. If the sediment is composed of fine particles, such as clay, it may require more water for the particles to settle, and therefore, potentially leading to a slower rate of sedimentary rock formation. On the other hand, if the sediment is composed of coarse particles, such as sand or gravel, it may compact more quickly and form sedimentary rock more rapidly. Another factor that can affect sedimentary rock formation is the rate of cementation. Cementation is the process wherein dissolved minerals act as a “glue” to bind the sediment particles together over time, ultimately solidifying the material into rock. If the environment in which the sediment is deposited is favorable for cementation (e.g., it has the right chemical conditions), this can encourage more rapid sedimentary rock formation. Conversely, if the environment is unfavorable for cementation, the process may be slowed down or may not occur at all. The second effect you mentioned is the compression of older sediments by the overlying sediments. If less sediment is being carried away, this could result in more significant compression of the sediment layers due to the increased rate of deposition. This increased compression could lead to the more rapid formation of sedimentary rocks in the affected area. In conclusion, if less sediment is carried away, it can potentially have a “more” effect on the formation of sedimentary rocks through increased accumulation, faster compaction, and a higher degree of compression. However, various factors such as the nature of the sediment, rate of cementation, and the environmental conditions in which the sediment is deposited can also influence the formation of sedimentary rocks. Consequently, the overall impact of the reduced sediment transportation will depend on the combined influences of these factors in any given geological setting."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Information:  - The Deutsche Luftstreitkräfte (German Air Force)known before October 1916 as the Fliegertruppen des deutschen Kaiserreiches (\\"Imperial German Flying Corps\\") or simply Die Fliegertruppewas the World War I (191418) air arm of the German Army, of which it remained an integral part. In English-language sources it is usually referred to as the Imperial German Air Service, although that is not a literal translation of either name. German naval aviators serving with the \\"Marine-Fliegerabteilung\\" remained an integral part of the Imperial German Navy \\"(Kaiserliche Marine)\\". Both military branches, the army and navy, operated conventional aircraft, observation balloons and Zeppelins.  - The Luftwaffe was the aerial warfare branch of the combined German Wehrmacht military forces during World War II. Germany's military air arms during the First World War, the \\"Luftstreitkräfte\\" of the Army and the \\"Marine-Fliegerabteilung\\" of the Navy, had been disbanded in May 1920 as a result of the terms of the Treaty of Versailles which stated that Germany was forbidden to have any air force.  - A flying ace or fighter ace is a military aviator credited with shooting down several enemy aircraft during aerial combat. The actual number of aerial victories required to officially qualify as an \\"ace\\" has varied, but is usually considered to be five or more. The few aces among combat aviators have historically accounted for the majority of air-to-air victories in military history.  - The Wehrmacht (lit. \\"defence force\\") was the unified armed forces of Nazi Germany from 1935 to 1946. It consisted of the \\"Heer\\" (army), the \\"Kriegsmarine\\" (navy) and the \\"Luftwaffe\\" (air force). The designation \\"Wehrmacht\\" for Nazi Germany's military replaced the previously used term, \\"Reichswehr\\" (191935), and was the manifestation of Nazi Germany's efforts to rearm the nation to a greater extent than the Treaty of Versailles permitted.  - The Messerschmitt Bf 109, was a German World War II fighter aircraft that was the backbone of the Luftwaffe's fighter force. The Bf 109 first saw operational service during the Spanish Civil War (1939) and was still in service at the dawn of the jet age at the end of World War II (1945). It was one of the most advanced fighters of the era, including such features as all-metal monocoque construction, a closed canopy, and retractable landing gear. It was powered by a liquid-cooled, inverted-V12 aero engine. From the end of 1941, the Bf 109 was steadily being supplemented by the superior Focke-Wulf Fw 190.  - An aircraft is a machine that is able to fly by gaining support from the air. It counters the force of gravity by using either static lift or by using the dynamic lift of an airfoil, or in a few cases the downward thrust from jet engines.  - Squadron leader (Sqn Ldr in the RAF and PAF; SQNLDR in the RAAF and RNZAF; formerly sometimes S/L in all services) is a commissioned rank in the Royal Air Force and the air forces of many countries which have historical British influence. It is also sometimes used as the English translation of an equivalent rank in countries which have a non-English air force-specific rank structure.   - The Desert Air Force (DAF), also known chronologically as Air Headquarters Western Desert, Air Headquarters Libya, the Western Desert Air Force, and the First Tactical Air Force (1TAF), was an Allied tactical air force created from No. 204 Group under RAF Middle East Command in North Africa in 1941 to provide close air support to the British Eighth Army. Throughout World War II, the DAF was made up of squadrons from the Royal Air Force (RAF), the South African Air Force (SAAF), the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) and other Allied air forces.  - Hans-Joachim Marseille (13 December 1919  30 September 1942) was a \\"Luftwaffe\\" fighter pilot and flying ace during World War II. He is noted for his aerial battles during the North African Campaign and his Bohemian lifestyle. One of the most successful fighter pilots, he was nicknamed the \\"Star of Africa\\". Marseille claimed all but seven of his \\"official\\" 158 victories against the British Commonwealth's Desert Air Force over North Africa, flying the Messerschmitt Bf 109 fighter for his entire combat career. No other pilot claimed as many Western Allied aircraft as Marseille.  - Squadron Leader Derek Harland Ward , DFC & Bar , was a New Zealand flying ace during the Second World War . He was credited with six kills , one shared destroyed , one probable and four damaged against the Luftwaffe . Ward was shot down and killed by the German ace Hans - Joachim Marseille on 17 June 1942 . Among his notable victories was a Focke - Wulf 200 \`\` Condor '' , destroyed on 1 May 1942 .  - The Royal Air Force (RAF) is the United Kingdom's aerial warfare force. Formed towards the end of the First World War on 1 April 1918, it is the oldest independent air force in the world. Following victory over the Central Powers in 1918 the RAF emerged as, at the time, the largest air force in the world. Since its formation, the RAF has taken a significant role in British military history, in particular, playing a large part in the Second World War where it fought its most famous campaign, the Battle of Britain.

We will first combine these terms. 0 = (125v - 104v) - 21 By combining the like terms, we get: 0 = 21v - 21 Step 2: Isolate the variable v Now we need to isolate the variable v by moving the constant term to the other side of the equation. To do this, we will add 21 to both sides of the equation: 0 + 21 = 21v - 21 + 21 Which simplifies to: 21 = 21v Step 3: Solve for v Since we now have the equation in the form of 21 = 21v, we can solve for v by dividing both sides of the equation by 21. 21 ÷ 21 = 21v ÷ 21 By dividing both sides by 21, we get: 1 = v So, the solution to the equation 0 = 125v - 104v - 21 is v = 1."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: Process: - Carbon dioxide from the air passes through small pores (holes) in the leaves - These pores are called stomata - Water is absorbed by the roots - It passes through vessels in the stem on its way to the leaves - Sunlight is absorbed by a green chemical in the leaves.  Question: suppose more pollution occurs happens, how will it affect more resources filling the pores occurs.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","output":"An increase in pollution, particularly in the form of airborne particulate matter and harmful gases, can potentially have detrimental effects on the process of photosynthesis in plants. To examine how an increase in pollution may affect the availability of resources filling the stomatal pores, it's crucial to understand the primary elements involved in photosynthesis: carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight. Based on these factors, let's analyze the potential impacts on each one. 1. Carbon dioxide: As pollution increases, the concentration of gaseous pollutants, such as sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx), also rises. These pollutants can have negative effects on plants as they compete with carbon dioxide for uptake through the stomatal pores. As a result, the availability of CO2 for plants may be reduced, which can adversely affect the process of photosynthesis. Hence, in this scenario, the answer would be B: less. 2. Water: An increase in pollution can lead to the contamination of water sources, reducing the availability of clean water for plants to absorb through their roots. Furthermore, climate change induced by the rise of greenhouses gases may cause irregular water distribution, which could lead to droughts or flooding, further stressing the plants and affecting their water uptake. As a result, the answer for water availability would also be B: less. 3. Sunlight: The presence of particulate matter and smog formed due to pollution, mainly in urban areas, can reduce the amount of sunlight reaching plants' leaves. Additionally, some pollutants may adhere to the leaf surface, hindering the absorption of sunlight by the green chemical chlorophyll, which is vital for photosynthesis. Consequently, the availability of sunlight as a resource for plants is also likely to be affected negatively in this case. The answer for sunlight would again be B: less. In conclusion, an increase in pollution has the potential to negatively affect the availability of essential resources required for plants' photosynthesis. The stomatal pores might get filled with less carbon dioxide, and the plants may experience a drop in the amount of sunlight and clean water they receive. So the answer, considering these factors, would be B: less."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Pine hatchery had great result the past few years because they found a way to reduce ammonia water toxicity. Spruce hatchery has big ammonia toxicity problems and hadn't find a way to remediate them.  and a hint : Ammonia toxicity is believed to be a cause of otherwise unexplained losses in fish hatcheries. Excess ammonia may accumulate and cause alteration of metabolism or increases in the body pH of the exposed organism. Tolerance varies among fish species. At lower concentrations, around 0.05 mg/L, un-ionised ammonia is harmful to fish species and can result in poor growth and feed conversion rates, reduced fecundity and fertility and increase stress and susceptibility to bacterial infections and diseases. Exposed to excess ammonia, fish may suffer loss of equilibrium, hyper-excitability, increased respiratory activity and oxygen uptake and increased heart rate. At concentrations exceeding 2.0 mg/L, ammonia causes gill and tissue damage, extreme lethargy, convulsions, coma, and death. Experiments have shown that the lethal concentration for a variety of fish species ranges from 0.2 to 2.0 mg/l.During winter, when reduced feeds are administered to aquaculture stock, ammonia levels can be higher. Lower ambient temperatures reduce the rate of algal photosynthesis so less ammonia is removed by any algae present. Within an aquaculture environment, especially at large scale, there is no fast-acting remedy to elevated ammonia levels. Prevention rather than correction is recommended to reduce harm to farmed fish and in open water systems, the surrounding environment.  Please answer this question : Which hatchery found fewer fish with poor growth?

As a child, he owned a bull's pizzle, which was given to him to use as a cattle whip. He began collecting penises after a friend heard the story of the bull's penis in 1974 and gave him four new ones, three of which Sigurður gave to friends. Acquaintances at whaling stations began bringing him whale penises as well, and the collection grew from there, expanding through donations and acquisitions from various sources around Iceland.The organs of farm animals came from slaughterhouses, while fishermen supplied those of pinnipeds and the smaller whales. The penises of larger whales came from commercial whaling stations, although this source dried up after the International Whaling Commission implemented a global ban on commercial whaling in 1986. Sigurður was able to continue to collect whale penises by harvesting them from the 12–16 whales that fall victim to stranding on the Icelandic coast each year. He also obtained the penis of a polar bear shot by fishermen who found the animal drifting on drift ice off the Westfjords.Sigurður was assisted by his family, though not without some occasional embarrassment.

Hate: Bill Clinton allegedly hates Barack Obama and this animosity stems from accusations of racism against the former president during Obama's 2008 defeat of Hillary Clinton The simmering cauldron of hatred that exists between the Obamas and the Clintons threatens to explode in a volcanic eruption that could threaten all Democrat chances in 2016, says a sensational new book. Despite their much-vaunted public truce, journalist Edward Klein claims in 'Blood Feud' that Bill Clinton despises President Obama and that Michelle refers to Hillary behind closed doors as the 'Hildebeest'. The animosity between the Democratic Party's two power couples has reached such intensity that Klein says the president is willing to renege on his promise to endorse Hillary for 2016 and has teased the Clintons with suggestions that Michelle would be a strong candidate for the Oval Office. said that if he hadn’t been on a mission to strike a deal with","output":"Iran over its nuclear program, he would have prevented the publication of the book 'Blood Feud' altogether, as its allegations have the potential to create serious rifts within the Democratic Party.

While the Clinton camp fears that Obama may promote Michelle as a contender for the 2016 elections, undermining Hillary's chances, the Obamas view the Clintons as a threat to the president's legacy. In this tense atmosphere, both families must find a way to work together and put their differences aside, focusing on party unity and the common goal of the Democrats winning the 2016 presidential race.

If blood is red, why are veins  blue? Actually, veins are not blue at all. They are more of a clear, yellowish colour. Although blood looks red when it's outside the body, when it's sitting in a vein near the surface of the skin, it's more of a dark reddish purple colour. At the right depth, these blood-filled veins reflect less red light than the surrounding skin, making them look blue by comparison. Which works harder, your heart or your brain? This question depends on whether you're busy thinking or busy exercising. Your heart works up to three times harder during exercise, and shifts enough blood over a lifetime to fill a supertanker. But, in the long run, your brain probably tips it, because even when you're sitting still your brain is using twice as much energy as your heart, and it takes four to five times as much blood to feed it. Do old people shrink as they age? Yes and no. Many people do get shorter as they age. But, when they do, it isn't because they're shrinking all over. They simply lose height as their spine  becomes shorter and more curved due to disuse and the effects of gravity . Many (but not all) men and women do lose height as they get older. Men lose an average of 3-4 cm in height as they age, while women may lose 5 cm or more. If you live to be 200 years old, would you keep shrinking till you were, like 60 cm tall, like a little boy again?No, because old people don't really shrink!It is not that they are growing backwards--their legs, arms and backbones getting shorter. When they do get shorter, it's because the spine has shortened a little. Or, more often, become more bent and curved. Why does spinning make you dizzy ? Because your brain gets confused between what you're seeing and what you're feeling. The brain senses that you're spinning using special gravity and motion sensing organs in your inner ear, which work together with your eyes to keep your vision and balance stable. But when you suddenly stop spinning , the system goes out... Question: Why do some old people look a little shrunken as they age? Yes or no, is the answer \\"Their spine becomes more bent.\\"? A:","output":"Yes, the answer is \\"Their spine becomes more bent.\\" As people age, their spine may become shorter and more curved due to disuse and the effects of gravity.

Possible A: flintlock, tennis court, at home, motion, arcade  Why is \\"arcade\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","output":"The option \\"arcade\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it is the most fitting context for the given scenario, considering safety, entertainment, and practicality. Let's analyze each option to understand the rationale for choosing \\"arcade\\" as the most appropriate answer: 1. Flintlock: A flintlock refers to an antiquated form of firearm or mechanism. Firing a projectile ball at a clown's mouth using a flintlock would be highly dangerous, as it could cause physical harm both to the shooter and the person or object being used as the target. This choice does not align with common sense. 2. Tennis court: A tennis court is an outdoor sports venue designed for playing tennis. While it might be possible to fire a projectile ball toward a clown's mouth at a tennis court, it is not a typical environment for such an activity. The primary purpose of tennis courts is to play tennis, not to engage in activities like shooting projectile balls at targets. 3. At home: Firing a projectile ball at a clown's mouth in a residential setting is not advisable due to safety concerns and potential property damage. Additionally, some homes may not have sufficient space for such an activity, and it may not be appropriate for a residential environment. This option lacks the common sense of a safe and designated area. 4. Motion: Motion, in this context, is an abstract term that is not directly related to a specific location or setting for firing a projectile ball at a clown's mouth. Choosing \\"motion\\" as a location would not make sense as it does not correspond to a particular environment where the activity can take place safely and enjoyably. 5. Arcade: An arcade is a public setting designed for various forms of entertainment, including amusement games and attractions. Shooting a projectile ball at a clown's mouth is an activity that can be typically found in an arcade setting, as it involves skill-based target shooting and can be safely enjoyed by players of all ages. Arcades offer controlled environments, specialized equipment, and proper safety measures, ensuring a fun and secure experience. Considering all the given options, \\"arcade\\" aligns with human common sense because it is a location specifically designed for amusement activities such as firing a projectile ball at a clown's mouth.

Given the question: Given the below context:  Charlemagne planned to continue the Frankish tradition of dividing his kingdom between all his heirs, but was unable to do so as only one son, Louis the Pious (r. 814–840), was still alive by 813. Just before Charlemagne died in 814, he crowned Louis as his successor. Louis's reign of 26 years was marked by numerous divisions of the empire among his sons and, after 829, civil wars between various alliances of father and sons over the control of various parts of the empire. Eventually, Louis recognised his eldest son Lothair I (d. 855) as emperor and gave him Italy. Louis divided the rest of the empire between Lothair and Charles the Bald (d. 877), his youngest son. Lothair took East Francia, comprising both banks of the Rhine and eastwards, leaving Charles West Francia with the empire to the west of the Rhineland and the Alps. Louis the German (d. 876), the middle child, who had been rebellious to the last, was allowed to keep Bavaria under the suzerainty of his elder brother. The division was disputed. Pepin II of Aquitaine (d. after 864), the emperor's grandson, rebelled in a contest for Aquitaine, while Louis the German tried to annex all of East Francia. Louis the Pious died in 840, with the empire still in chaos.A three-year civil war followed his death. By the Treaty of Verdun (843), a kingdom between the Rhine and Rhone rivers was created for Lothair to go with his lands in Italy, and his imperial title was recognised. Louis the German was in control of Bavaria and the eastern lands in modern-day Germany. Charles the Bald received the western Frankish lands, comprising most of modern-day France. Charlemagne's grandsons and great-grandsons divided their kingdoms between their descendants, eventually causing all internal cohesion to be lost. In 987 the Carolingian dynasty was replaced in the western lands, with the crowning of Hugh Capet (r. 987–996) as king. In the eastern lands the dynasty had died out earlier, in 911, with the death of Louis the Child, and the selection of the unrelated Conrad I (r....  Guess a valid title for it!

Des cas documentés de TdP (mortels et non mortels) associés à l'utilisation d'un médicament ont entraîné le retrait du marché de plusieurs médicaments et la relégation d'autres parmi les médicaments de deuxième intention. Translate to English","output":"Documented cases of TdP (both fatal and non-fatal) associated with the use of a drug have led to the withdrawal of several drugs from the market and the relegation of others to second-line treatments. TdP, also known as Torsades de Pointes, is a type of life-threatening abnormal heart rhythm that can be potentially fatal. It is seen particularly in patients who have a history of heart issues or are under certain medications that put them at risk for developing this condition. In the pharmaceutical industry, when drugs are found to be associated with significant safety issues like TdP, they undergo strict regulatory review and scrutiny, which may result in several potential outcomes. One of these outcomes is the withdrawal of the drug from the market, meaning that the drug is no longer approved to be sold and prescribed to patients due to the risks it presents. The process of withdrawal starts with drug safety monitoring authorities, such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), identifying the risks associated with the drug. They review clinical data and reports, including side effects and adverse events reported by doctors, patients, and drug manufacturers. If a strong link between the drug and TdP is established, this information is shared with other regulatory agencies around the world to ensure that the drug is removed from the market to protect patients’ safety. Another possible outcome of this safety review is the relegation of the drug to the status of a second-line treatment option. This usually occurs when a drug has proven to be less safe than other alternatives, but the benefits of its use might still be considered greater than its risks for certain patients under specific circumstances. In such cases, the drug may still remain on the market but with new usage guidelines, reflecting its newfound second-line status. This may involve doctors being advised to choose alternative medications first, and the relegation of the drug to a backup option, reserved only for cases when first-line treatments prove to be ineffective or intolerable due to side effects. In both withdrawal and relegation scenarios, one common goal is to ensure patient safety. Healthcare practitioners and regulatory authorities work together to monitor drug safety, review potential risks, and act accordingly to protect public health. Drug manufacturers are also responsible for ongoing monitoring of drug safety and reporting findings to regulatory agencies to help maintain the safety and integrity of the medicines that people take every day."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Two coastal communities  on two neighboring gulfs took different approaches to  bringing more money into the local economy. Davin village continued with commercial fishing and agriculture, while the village of Forx decided to mine sand from the nearby dunes, because it was very profitable. They did not think about the effect it would have on the environment.  Hint: Sand mining is a direct cause of erosion, and impacts the local wildlife.[2] Various animals depend on sandy beaches for nesting clutches, and mining has led to the near extinction of gharials (a species of crocodile) in India. Disturbance of underwater and coastal sand causes turbidity in the water, which is harmful for organisms like coral that need sunlight. It can also destroy fisheries, financially harming their operators.  Removal of physical coastal barriers, such as dunes, sometimes leads to flooding of beachside communities, and the destruction of picturesque beaches causes tourism to dissipate. Sand mining is regulated by law in many places, but is often done illegally.[3] Globally, it is a 70 billion industry, with sand selling at up to 90 per cubic yard.[4] Answer:","output":"Davin village was more thoughtful about the environment.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Write some highlights for the following article: When District Attorney Carol Chambers last tweeted about a shooting in Aurora, it was about a man found guilty of a killing at a liquor store. Chambers touted the success of her office in convicting Anthony Jahmar Gillespie for shooting to death Benigno Morales-Ramirez. Few outside Colorado probably knew Chambers' name then -- her Twitter account only has 62 followers. But that was a month before the cinema killings. Before James Holmes, the man with orange hair who called himself \\"The Joker,\\" was arrested for spraying a movie theater audience with gunfire during an early morning screening of the new Batman movie. He stands accused of killing 12 people and wounding 38 others. Official: Package at university mail room apparently sent by Colorado suspect. Now Chambers finds herself handling America's next big case, all eyes upon her to deliver justice. She appeared in a dark pantsuit before a horde of reporters and clicking cameras on Monday, the day Holmes first appeared in court. Some who know her believe this case presents the moment she has long awaited. She's a veteran prosecutor who has rarely drawn attention beyond the local limelight. This could be her last hurrah as head of the 18th Judicial District -- term limits on her office force her to step down later this year. She's known for being tough. She's known even more for not caring how she or her actions are reflected in public. She told The Denver Post once that she was \\"not motivated by people to like me.\\" Rick Kornfeld, a defense lawyer in Denver who has known Chambers for years, said she is someone who believes strongly in what she is doing and doesn't care if she garners negative publicity. \\"That is to be respected,\\" he said. But it has also made her a controversial figure in the world of Colorado courts. Alan Prendergast, a journalist for Denver's Westword newspaper who has covered Chambers since she took office in 2004, called her a maverick who is well acquainted with controversy. Threats before, after other 'Dark Knight' showings, authorities said. Prendergast has doggedly written about how Chambers has turned her office into a \\"conviction machine.\\" From seeking the death penalty in a state that does not embrace it to pursuing harsh habitual-criminal charges against chronic but low-level offenders, she has earned a reputation as a hard-ass. \\"As far as prosecution is concerned, you probably couldn't be in a better jurisdiction,\\" said Todd Whelan, who worked in Chambers' office before she was elected district attorney and later, as a defense attorney, butted legal heads with her in court. A 2008 Westword article was headlined \\"The Punisher: Censured but defiant, Carol Chambers goes after habitual criminals -- and cops, judges and lawyers -- like no other district attorney. But at what cost?\\" The cost was that these low-level offenders were being put away on absurdly long and costly sentences when the prison system was overloaded and rehab programs were grossly underfunded, wrote Prendergast, citing Colorado defense attorneys. Residents return to building where suspect set boobytraps. Chambers, said Whelan, goes after the most minor offenders with gusto. \\"There's no deference given to any defendant whatsoever,\\" he said. Chambers is the only state district attorney in Colorado to seek the death penalty in the past five years. Two of the three men on Colorado's death row were prosecuted by Chambers. That makes her an anomaly in a state that fell one vote short in 2009 of abolishing capital punishment. \\"That jurisdiction is very enamored with the death penalty,\\" Kornfeld said about Arapahoe County. \\"And this is a state that uses it very sparingly.\\" Many of the Aurora cinema shooting victims' family and friends are demanding death for the suspect. In this case, they will have a prosecutor who is not shy about seeking the harshest punishment. \\"If there ever was a case for the death penalty, this is probably that case,\\" Kornfeld said. \\"What's a more extreme case than this?\\" Colorado shooting: Stories of survival. Chambers told reporters this week that her office had a lot of work to do in the investigation. \\"I would say there's no such thing as a slam-dunk case,\\" she said. \\"We're still looking at the enormous amount of evidence.\\" She will get to decide whether Holmes' case will be a capital one. But by the time the trial progresses, which Kornfeld said could take years, Chambers will be long gone. \\"Chambers is a very successful prosecutor,\\" said a profile of her this week in the Atlantic magazine. \\"She has the experience, talent and intellect necessary to prosecute the coming Holmes case in a productive way. But she doesn't necessarily come to her most famous case, her legacy case, with completely clean hands.\\" She is tainted perhaps by allegations of questionable ethics -- including providing benefits to prosecution witnesses and a tight management style that has led to a backlog of cases, Kornfeld said. She was even publicly censured recently, Prendergast said. And, she has been known to scuffle with judges, police officers and other public officials. A Chambers spokeswoman said she would not comment because of a gag order placed on the Holmes case, but she has always denied the allegations against her and stood firmly in her convictions. Even some of her detractors call Chambers a fair person who tries to do the right thing. Kornfeld called her when he was defending Greg Kolomitz, the Colorado governor's former campaign manager who was accused of mishandling funds. He recalled her saying: I know what it's like to be a victim of a political witch hunt. We will investigate. Kornfeld said Chambers was fair. She is a Republican who was dealing with a Democratic scandal. But after looking into it, Chambers cleared Kolomitz of wrongdoing. Kornfeld said he believes Chambers' past comes into play in her role as a prosecutor. Court appearance fuels theories about Colorado shooting suspect. She was raised in a small town in Ohio, the daughter of a Presbyterian pastor, according to her official biography. Her grandfather worked for the church as did her three uncles. \\"So needless to say, my childhood centered around the church, which was our extended family,\\" she wrote in her biography. She earned a nursing degree from Texas Christian University and then moved to Denver, where she worked in the emergency room to put herself through law school at the University of Denver. \\"During the two years I worked in the ER at Denver General, I saw the results of homelessness, poverty, drug abuse, sudden and unexpected death, Alzheimer's, suicide, disabilities, mental illness, chronic disease, severe alcohol addiction, victimization, violent crime, sexual assault, child abuse, elder abuse and driving under the influence,\\" she wrote. How to help the victims. Kornfeld believes Chambers' nursing experience makes her extremely empathetic and solicitous of crime victims. \\"As all DAs should be,\\" he said. \\"But she comes at it from a different background.\\" Chambers worked in medical malpractice defense but wanted to be a prosecutor in criminal cases. She joined the 18th Judicial District, which covers four Colorado counties. Kornfeld said he understands why Chambers has a blemished reputation. But she's not necessarily as inflexible as people make her out to be. \\"If you ask her constituents, she's done an effective job as a law enforcement officer,\\" he said. She married Nathan Chambers, who defended the most notorious criminal perhaps in contemporary America -- Timothy McVeigh. He was even there to witness the execution of the Oklahoma City bomber. In Kornfeld's mind, that makes Carol Chambers not a zealot, after all. Now all of America will be able to see her, judge her, as Coloradans have done for years -- as she prosecutes a man suspected in another heinous act that will also be a part of modern American history.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the title of the work that reaches its triumphant ending in the key of D major?, using the article: Handel's music for Messiah  is distinguished from most of his other oratorios by an orchestral restraint—a quality which the musicologist Percy M. Young observes was not adopted by Mozart and other later arrangers of the music. The work begins quietly, with instrumental and solo movements preceding the first appearance of the chorus, whose entry in the low alto register is muted. A particular aspect of Handel's restraint is his limited use of trumpets throughout the work. After their introduction in the Part I chorus \\"Glory to God\\", apart from the solo in \\"The trumpet shall sound\\" they are heard only in \\"Hallelujah\\" and the final chorus \\"Worthy is the Lamb\\". It is this rarity, says Young, that makes these brass interpolations particularly effective: \\"Increase them and the thrill is diminished\\". In  \\"Glory to God\\", Handel marked the entry of the trumpets as da lontano e un poco piano, meaning \\"quietly, from afar\\"; his original intention had been to place the brass offstage (in disparte) at this point, to highlight the effect of distance.  In this initial appearance the trumpets lack the expected drum accompaniment, \\"a deliberate withholding of effect, leaving something in reserve for Parts II and III\\"  according to Luckett.Although Messiah is not in any particular key, Handel's tonal scheme has been summarised by the musicologist Anthony Hicks as \\"an aspiration towards D major\\", the key musically associated with light and glory. As the oratorio moves forward with various shifts in key to reflect changes in mood, D major emerges at significant points, primarily the \\"trumpet\\" movements with their uplifting messages. It is the key in which the work reaches its triumphant ending. In the absence of a predominant key, other integrating elements have been proposed. For example, the musicologist Rudolf Steglich has suggested that Handel used the device of the \\"ascending fourth\\"  as a unifying motif; this device most noticeably occurs in the first two notes of \\"I know that my Redeemer liveth\\" and on numerous other..., what would be the answer ?","output":"Based on the information provided in the excerpt, the answer to the question \\"What is the title of the work that reaches its triumphant ending in the key of D major?\\" is Handel's \\"Messiah\\". The excerpt states that \\"it is the key in which the work reaches its triumphant ending,\\" referring to D major, and the article is discussing Handel's music for Messiah."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: Just seconds after home right-back Conor Coady had coolly cleared off the line from Britt Assombalonga, Wolves broke straight away down the right. Andreas Weimann squared for Dicko to tuck home, before Forest's Danny Fox was sent off in stoppage time. The hosts' fifth straight win leaves Forest two points clear of trouble. Paul Lambert's Wolves are now a much healthier 11 points above the relegation zone with a game in hand on many of the teams below them, who have just six matches left to play. A generally frustrating night could have turned out differently after Wolves were clearly hindered by the loss of record signing Helder Costa, who pulled out after aggravating an ankle injury in the pre-match warm-up, to be replaced by Dicko. Assombalonga was close to scoring early on when he cut inside and tested Wolves keeper Andy Lonergan with a low right-foot shot saved at his near post. Dicko then went close at the other end with a low left-foot shot just wide, while Ben Marshall sent a right-foot curler just past the post after the break. Forest then seemed certain to break the deadlock when Wolves found themselves outnumbered. But, after a desperate tackle from Ivan Cavaleiro, the covering Coady got back to clear on the line - and Wolves rapidly made Forest pay for their profligacy. Wolves went down the other end, Dicko slid in from close range for only his fourth goal of the season - and a theatrical Lambert leapt high in the air in his technical area to celebrate. Forest substitute Jamie Ward had a hooked left-foot volley saved by Lonergan, who then made a desperate save to deny another of Forest's subs, Mustapha Carayol, in the last minute of stoppage time, after Fox was sent off for a second yellow card. But Wolves hung on for the victory that all but ensures their Championship safety. Wolves boss Paul Lambert told BBC Sport: \\"We had a bit of a doubt over Helder Costa's ankle in the warm-up, so we made the late change. \\"But we had every confidence that Nouha Dicko would do a good job for us. And Ivan Cavaleiro did well too. He's a big talent. \\"When he gets the ball he's exciting, but he also did well for us when he tracked back to help stop them scoring. Conor Coady on the goal line was a big moment for us and then we showed how quickly we can break.\\" Forest boss Mark Warburton told BBC Radio Nottingham: \\"It hurts to lose in that way. We had our best chance of the game, it falls sweetly for the goalkeeper and then, 10 or 12 seconds later, it's in the back of our net. \\"They are the fine margins. Goals change games, as they say.

She tells Mickey she bought the bar after the old owner killed herself, \\"over some guy\\". The bar is a popular spot for patrons looking for one night stands. Although Eve is also attracted to Mickey, she refuses to commit to any one man, confessing to radio talk show host Dr. Nancy Love that she ruined too many marriages to have one of her own. That night Eve rebuffs Mickey's advances and sleeps with the bartender who has a crush on her, while avoiding the married man she's been having an affair with. That same night, Dr. Nancy Love answered Eve's ad for a roommate to share her house, and moves in the next day. Nancy conceals her identity and begins to observe Eve's romantic entanglements even as she counsels Eve through her radio show. When Eve's married lover, Zack, calls looking for her, Nancy asks penetrating questions and begins dispensing relationship advice, despite the fact that she herself has been unable to maintain a successful relationship.

Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","output":"To determine if the premise supports the hypothesis, let's break down the given statements and analyze their relationship. Premise: \\"But there's a box just round the corner.\\" This statement informs us that there is a box located around the corner, although it does not provide any specific information about the size (small, medium, large) or other characteristics of the box. Hypothesis: \\"There's a small box around the corner.\\" This statement indicates that there is a box around the corner, as the premise states, but it also includes a specific detail (the size of the box being 'small') not mentioned in the premise. Before we draw any conclusions, let's review the concept of validity in deductive reasoning. In deductive reasoning, an argument is considered valid if the truth of its premises guarantees the truth of its conclusion. For an argument to be valid, it must be impossible for the premises to be true and the conclusion to be false. Now, let's examine the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis. If the premise is true, meaning there is indeed a box around the corner, there are a few possibilities: 1. The box is small, which would make the hypothesis true. 2. The box is medium-sized or large, which would make the hypothesis false, as it specifically states that the box is small. 3. The box has a different characteristic, such as being round, but not necessarily small, making the hypothesis neither true nor false. Given these possibilities, we cannot definitively conclude that if the premise is true, the hypothesis must also be true. The premise on its own does not provide enough information to confirm the specific detail of the box's size mentioned in the hypothesis. The hypothesis could be correct, but it might not be - our conclusion would rely on assumptions not supported by the premise.  In conclusion, based on the premise, it is not possible to definitively conclude that the hypothesis is true. The premise only guarantees that there is a box around the corner, without providing any information about its size. Without additional premises that confirm the box's size, we cannot verify if the hypothesis is true or false."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Please add spaces between words: Toraisetheanimalsandprovidebeefforourconsumption,forestsandjunglesequivalenttotheareaofEnglandarebeingfelledeachyear.","output":"To raise the animals and provide beef for our consumption, forests and jungles equivalent to the area of England are being felled each year. This statement highlights the significant impact of the meat industry, specifically cattle farming, on deforestation and environmental issues. The raising of cattle for beef production requires immense amounts of land for grazing, feed production, and other associated activities. As the global demand for beef continues to grow, more and more land is cleared to accommodate this industry. This deforestation leads to several consequences, both for the environment and local communities. Firstly, deforestation contributes to the loss of biodiversity. Forests and jungles serve as home to countless species of plants, animals, and other organisms. Clearing these habitats for cattle farming invariably leads to the displacement and potential extinction of various species, ultimately diminishing the richness and stability of ecosystems. Secondly, deforestation has significant implications for climate change. Forests serve as massive carbon sinks, absorbing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and storing it within plant tissues and soil. When these forests are cut down, the stored carbon is released back into the atmosphere, contributing to the greenhouse effect and global warming. Furthermore, the loss of forest cover disrupts the local water cycle, leading to changes in precipitation patterns and potentially exacerbating water scarcity in affected regions. Thirdly, deforestation can have severe social consequences. In many instances, forests and jungles are home to indigenous communities who rely on the land for their livelihoods, culture, and well-being. The expansion of cattle farming often results in the displacement of these communities, threatening their way of life and potentially contributing to social conflict and instability. There are some efforts in place to address this issue, such as promoting sustainable beef production practices and encouraging a shift toward more plant-based diets. While such changes may not completely eliminate the need for cattle farming and associated deforestation, they can help minimize the negative impacts on the environment and communities. In conclusion, the statement \\"To raise the animals and provide beef for our consumption, forests and jungles equivalent to the area of England are being felled each year\\" serves as a stark reminder of the immense environmental and social impacts associated with the global meat industry. Efforts to reduce these impacts, through sustainable farming practices and dietary shifts, are essential for ensuring a more environmentally responsible and socially equitable food production system."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer: Thucydides noted that people who had recovered from a previous bout of the disease could nurse the sick without contracting the illness a second time.  Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion?","output":"Immunology, the study of the immune system and how it protects the body from various pathogens and diseases, began to emerge as a distinct scientific discipline in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. While it is true that the Greek historian Thucydides indeed observed the concept of immunity during the Plague of Athens in 430 B.C., the codification of immunology as a scientific theory took shape much later, with significant milestones and contributions by several researchers. Three major discoveries in the late 19th century laid the groundwork for immunology as a formal scientific field: 1. Immunization and the discovery of the germ theory: Louis Pasteur and Robert Koch contributed significantly to the understanding of the role of microorganisms as agents causing infectious diseases. Pasteur's widely acknowledged research on vaccination, starting with the development of the chicken cholera vaccine in the 1870s and leading up to the rabies vaccine in 1885, established the basis for using weakened or inactivated pathogens to provide immunity against diseases. 2. Cellular Immunology: In 1883, Russian biologist Elie Metchnikoff discovered phagocytosis, a process by which certain cells in the immune system called phagocytes engulf and destroy foreign particles or pathogens. He proposed the theory of cellular immunity, suggesting that the body's defense mechanisms work through interactions between various types of cells. 3. Humoral Immunology: In the late 1800s and early 1900s, researchers Emil von Behring and Shibasaburo Kitasato worked on the principles of humoral immunity, which involves the production of soluble substances called antibodies in response to infection. In 1890, they demonstrated that serum from the blood of a diphtheria-immune animal could transfer protective immunity to a non-immune animal, thus realizing the concept of passive immunity. These groundbreaking discoveries in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, coupled with subsequent advances in the understanding of the complex interactions between cells, molecules, and organisms in the immune system, established immunology as a distinct scientific discipline. Today, immunology has broad applications in various fields, including medicine, epidemiology, and public health, and it continues to evolve through ongoing research."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: You are given a new situation: Jake and his son Ryan just had their yearly physical examination by the doctor. As part of this year's examination, both men had their arterial walls examined to identify the presence of plaques. The doctor discovered that Jake had a high amount of plaques present on the interior of his arterial wall. Ryan, on the other hand, had no plaques present.  and a hint : Cholesterol has been implicated in heart disease for decades. Atherosclerosis is a disorder of the arteries in which cholesterol and other materials are deposited on the interior of the arterial wall. These deposits lead to the formation of plaques that can restrict or even block the flow of blood through these blood vessels (see Figure below ). A decrease in the flow of blood can lead to high blood pressure and a lowered oxygen supply to the heart muscle. A complete blockage of blood flow to parts of the heart (a heart attack) can cause significant damage due to oxygen deprivation, in some cases leading to death.  Please answer this question : Who is less likely to have lowered oxygen supply to their heart muscles? Answer:","output":"Ryan is less likely to have a lowered oxygen supply to their heart muscles. This is because, during their physical examination, it was found that Ryan had no plaques present in his arterial walls, while Jake had a high amount of plaques. Atherosclerosis, which is characterized by cholesterol and other material deposits forming plaques on the interior of the arterial wall, can lead to restricted or blocked blood flow. When blood flow is decreased, it results in high blood pressure and reduced oxygen supply to the heart muscles. Since Ryan does not have any plaques present in his arterial walls, his blood flow is less likely to be restricted, which lowers the likelihood of him experiencing a reduced oxygen supply to his heart muscles."},{"instruction":"Q:Here's a complex question that requires someone to reason about the input, can you answer it?

It is not possible to tell Based on the provided premise, \\"Reduction Act Begins field,\\" it is challenging to precisely conclude that the hypothesis \\"The reduction act has begun.\\" is true. There is some ambiguity in the context, and more information is required to make a more informed decision. Firstly, the premise itself could be open to various interpretations. The term \\"Reduction Act\\" might refer to several meanings, such as a legislation or initiative aimed at reducing something (e.g., spending, carbon emissions, waste production, etc.). Similarly, \\"begins field\\" could be referring to the act's starting point, a specific location or area it applies, the field of study it impacts, an implementation period, or other possible meanings. Secondly, there is insufficient detail in the premise to determine the hypothesis's truthfulness entirely. To make a more accurate assessment, additional context, and supplementary information about the Reduction Act would be beneficial. More information may include the specific area or topic of the act, the act's purpose, its targeted goals, and the timeline for its commencement. Furthermore, broader background knowledge about the Reduction Act helps cement a better understanding of the premise's aim and offer a more concrete response to the hypothesis. Essential factors to consider include the act's stakeholders, its overall projected impact, and the reasons behind the act's inception. Lastly, the context is essential to determine the truthfulness of any hypothesis accurately, especially when working with a limited premise.

A: Answer:","output":"The movement of molten metal in the Earth's outer core is responsible for creating Earth's geomagnetic field, also known as the magnetosphere. This is a complex process centered around the generation of electric currents and magnetic fields arising from the movement of molten metal, mainly composed of iron and nickel, within Earth's outer core. Several factors contribute to the movement of the molten metal in the outer core. These factors include: 1. Earth's rotation: The Earth spins on its axis, which causes the molten metal in the outer core to swirl and move in a circular motion. This rotation movement is known as the Coriolis effect. 2. Differences in temperature and density: Temperature and density variations in the outer core lead to convection currents. Hotter, less dense liquid metal rises toward the boundary with the mantle, while cooler, denser liquid metal sinks back down toward the core. This continuous movement creates convection currents that circulate molten metal within the outer core. 3. Gravitational forces: The force of gravity influences the movement of the molten metal. As heavier, denser components of the core descend, it contributes to the overall circulation patterns in the outer core. These movements of molten metal create an electrical current due to a phenomenon called the dynamo effect. The dynamo effect, in simple terms, is an electric current generated by moving conductive fluids through a magnetic field. Since Earth's outer core is mostly composed of conductive materials like iron and nickel, the movement of these materials through the existing magnetic field amplifies and sustains the magnetic field. This self-sustaining process constantly regenerates Earth's geomagnetic field. The geomagnetic field serves several important functions: 1. Protection from solar winds and cosmic radiation: The magnetosphere protects Earth from harmful solar winds and cosmic radiation by deflecting or trapping them before they can penetrate the atmosphere. These solar particles can cause significant damage to living organisms and interfere with electronic systems, satellites, and communication networks. 2. Navigation: Earth's magnetic field is essential for navigation, particularly for species that rely on magnetic compasses to determine their location and direction. This includes animals such as birds and sea turtles, which navigate vast distances during migration using Earth's magnetic field. 3. Preservation of Earth's atmosphere: The magnetosphere plays a critical role in preserving Earth's atmosphere by shielding it from the erosive effects of solar wind. Without our magnetic field, the solar wind would gradually strip away the atmosphere, making it difficult for life to exist on Earth. 4. Climate stabilizer: The Earth's magnetic field also contributes to the regulation and stabilization of the planet's climate by influencing atmospheric circulation and ocean currents. This impacts weather patterns and overall climate stability. In conclusion, the movement of molten metal in Earth's outer core creates a dynamic and self-sustaining geomagnetic field, providing essential protection and maintaining the viability of life on our planet."},{"instruction":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Question: How many NCAA tournament titles has the coach for the only college basketball team to have ever had its national title vacated won? Passage:The first NCAA Tournament was organized by the National Association of Basketball Coaches. Oregon won the inaugural tournament, defeating Ohio State 46–33 in the first championship game. Before the 1941 tournament, control of the event was given to the NCAA. In the early years of the tournament, it was considered less important than the National Invitation Tournament (NIT), a New York City-based event. Teams were able to compete in both events in the same year, and three of those that did so—Utah in 1944, Kentucky in 1949, and City College of New York (CCNY) in 1950—won the NCAA Tournament. The 1949–50 CCNY team won both tournaments (defeating Bradley in both finals), and is the only college basketball team to accomplish this feat. By the mid-1950s, the NCAA Tournament became the more prestigious of the two events, and in 1971 the NCAA barred universities from playing in other tournaments, such as the NIT, if they were invited to the NCAA Tournament. The 2013 championship won by Louisville was the first men's basketball national title to ever be vacated by the NCAA after the school and its coach at the time, Rick Pitino, were implicated in a 2015 sex scandal involving recruits.  Links: a. Rick Pitino b. National Invitation Tournament c. 2015 University of Louisville basketball sex scandal d. Rick Pitino","output":"First, we need to identify the question, which is asking about the number of NCAA tournament titles won by the coach of the only college basketball team to have its national title vacated. From the passage, we know that the coach is Rick Pitino and that the team's 2013 championship was vacated. Now, to answer this question, we need to search for more information about Rick Pitino and his NCAA tournament titles. We cannot answer this question based solely on the given passage. Upon further research, we can find that Rick Pitino has won two NCAA tournament titles: one with the University of Kentucky in 1996 and another with Louisville in 2013. Since the 2013 title was vacated, we can conclude that he has effectively won one NCAA tournament title. Therefore, the answer should be the term related to Rick Pitino, which is option \\"a\\"."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Select the correct sentiment of the following review: The interesting aspect of \\"The Apprentice\\" is it demonstrates that the traditional job interview and resume do not necessarily predict teamwork skills, task dedication, and job performance. And they certainly don't reveal any hidden agendas. In other words, a good indicator of potential may be to see a job applicant in action which is the point of \\"The Apprentice\\". People vying for a corporate position may hand over a sugar-coated resume and put on their best personality attire for the interview, but these are not necessarily the best indicator of strengths, weaknesses, and performance. Briefly, \\"The Apprentice\\" involves 16 job candidates competing for the ultimate career opportunity: a position in real estate magnate Donald Trump's investment company. \\"The Apprentice\\" refers to the winner who will win a salaried position, learn the art of high stakes deal-making from the master himself, and, presumably, gain prime corporate connections. The position is a dream-come-true for those wanting to make more money than the GNP of some foreign countries. To entice the candidates, Trump shows off his private jet, his private luxury apartments replete with statues and artwork, his limos, his connections to celebrities, and other aspects of the life of a billionaire magnate. The road to success is not easy. The group is divided into two teams that compete against each other. Each has a corporate-sounding name, such as Versacorps and Protégé Corporation. The teams are assigned tasks that entail an entrepreneurial venture such as creating advertising, selling merchandise, or negotiating. Teams select a project manager who provides the leadership and organizational skills to complete the task. If they win, the manager receives a lot of credit, particularly in the eyes of the final arbiter. If they lose, the manager may also become the scape-goat. Some of the tasks are monumentally difficult with only a day or two to complete. Tasks may involve creating a TV commercial, or print ad. Others may involve selling at a retail outlet or on the street. The tasks bring out the best and worst in the participants. They often show immediately who is the most reliable, who is the most trustworthy, and who is hard working. And the tasks also expose who is not a good team player, who is inefficient, and who seems only out for themselves. The tasks invariably reveal in unexpected ways the strengths and weaknesses of the participants and in particular the project manager. How well the manager communicates with the team, delegates work, organizes time, and sets specific goals will largely determine the outcome, but it does not necessarily predict the winner. The single-most telling aspect of someone's potential is when he or she is assigned as a project manager. Their real abilities as opposed to their self-propagated abilities immediately show through the veneer that cannot be hidden by a 100 silk tie or a beautiful makeover. Leadership qualities and/or weaknesses often become agonizingly obvious after only a few minutes. Those promoting themselves as top-notch leaders are not always as strong when put into a real-life leadership situation. It is always easier to \\"toot your own horn\\" than to actually engage in leadership. Project managers, even those on the winning teams, often do not formulate a cohesive strategy. They often believe that by diving off the deep end to complete the task at the first minute rather than taking a little time to organize and discuss how the task will be completed is more efficient. More often than not, members of an ill-strategized team are running around like headless chickens figuring it out as they go along, and in the long run they end up wasting far more time. The winning team gets a taste of the high life, such as eating dinner at an exclusive restaurant, flying in a private jet, and/or meeting a celebrity. The losing team comes to the dreaded board room where Trump hears the lame excuses of the members and knocks off one or more of the contestants like pieces off a chess board with the now infamous \\"You're fired\\". Often, the project manager is held partially responsible for the team's loss, and may be the target of Trump's accusatory rhetoric. Every week, at least one person becomes a casualty from the losing team.  My least-favorite aspect of \\"The Apprentice\\" is the board room. While the tasks themselves bring out the strengths and weaknesses in the candidates, the board room often brings out the worst. Unfortunately, the rules of the game insist there is one winning team and one losing team, even if the competition was close. Members of the losing team start accusing each other, often ruthlessly, about who was at fault. And sometimes more than one person gets fired. I seldom see an under-performing candidate take responsibility for their actions in the board room. Kristi Frank and Kwame Jackson were possibly the only candidates who took full responsibility for her team's losses and received no recognition for this selfless act. For me, Kristi Frank and Kwame Jackson had the most integrity of all the candidates. However, Trump saw Kristi as weak and fired her, claiming she wasn't standing up for herself, which may mean he values ego more than integrity. No one should sacrifice their integrity for this. Kristi Frank may not have become the apprentice but she can live with herself knowing she did not blame others unjustly. Isn't that worth as much as \\"winning\\"? The strength of \\"The Apprentice\\" is also its weakness. Because team performance is evaluated strictly by winners and losers, other evaluation opportunities are overlooked. Barring huge gaps between the winning and losing teams, sometimes a losing team exemplifies a high standard of teamwork and efficiency. I have seen losing teams sometimes appearing better organized than the winning team. We Americans are so often obsessed with winning and losing that we often overlook excellence.

Her father. A:","output":"Title: The Enchanted Legacy Step 1: Introduce the protagonist We begin with our protagonist, Maria, a young and curious woman in her early 20s. Maria has a passion for reading and learning new things, but her life is rather simple, living in a small town with her father. Step 2: Establish the mystery One day, while cleaning out her late mother's belongings, Maria stumbles upon a mysterious old book hidden in a secret compartment of her mother's desk. The book is titled \\"The Enchanted Legacy\\", and it's written in a language she has never seen before. Step 3: Reveal the source of the book Maria asks her father about the book, and he reluctantly reveals that he brought the book back from one of his travels to a remote village when he was younger. He explains it belonged to Maria's mother and that she never wanted Maria to find it, but now that she has, her father feels that the truth must be told. Step 4: Promise and warning Maria's father tells her that the book contains a powerful secret that can unlock unimaginable knowledge, but with this power comes great responsibility and danger. He warns her never to share its secrets with anyone and to exercise caution when using its power. Step 5: Exploration of the book's contents Spurred by her curiosity, Maria starts deciphering the book's contents. As she unlocks the knowledge within, she gains abilities such as telekinesis, telepathy, and even the power to manipulate time. As her powers grow, so does her desire to explore further and understand the full extent of the book's potential. Step 6: Conflict Maria's growing power attracts attention from a secret organization that has been searching for \\"The Enchanted Legacy\\" for centuries. They believe that Maria's possession of the book makes her a danger to the world, and they will stop at nothing to either control her or retrieve the book for themselves. Step 7: Internal struggle As Maria uses her newfound powers, she wrestles with the responsibility her father warned her about. She struggles to decide whether to use her powers for good and protect her loved ones or seek personal gain and adventure. Step 8: Climax In order to protect Maria and the book, her father is kidnapped, and Maria must go on a dangerous journey to save him and confront the organization. During this journey, she discovers that her mother was once a member of the organization but eventually rebelled and hid the book from them. Step 9: Resolution Maria successfully rescues her father and defeats the organization. She learns the true power of the book – that her mother's spirit is alive within it, guiding her choices. Maria makes the difficult decision to destroy the book, releasing her mother's spirit and ending the threat of the organization using it for malevolent purposes. Step 10: Conclusion Maria, now without the book's powers, returns to her normal life with her father, but she is forever changed by her experience. She has a greater appreciation for the life she leads, the extraordinary adventure, and the knowledge that her mother's love will always be with her."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: Where is the football club from that Glen Robert Moss plays for?

He was a prominent figure among the Jewish community in Medina before his conversion to Islam. After accepting Islam, he served as a bridge for understanding and cooperation between the Jewish people and the Muslims. Abdullah ibn Salam played a significant role in promoting interfaith dialogue and understanding between the two communities. His conversion and subsequent interactions with both communities highlight the potential for unity and coexistence between Jews and Muslims, despite differing religious beliefs."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. 2007 FIBA Americas Championship For 10 mens national basketball programs representing countries in the Americas, the road to the 2008 Summer Games in Beijing runs through Las Vegas. The 2007 FIBA Americas Championships are set to go from Aug. 22  Sept. 2 and for a retooled team from Canada, the stakes couldnt be higher with Olympic berths on the line. \\"I think the team is very focused,\\" said head coach Leo Rautins in a recent phone interview from San Juan, Puerto Rico in preparation for the tune-up Tuto Marchand Cup. \\"They understand that it's a tough task at hand, but at the same time they realize it has to be all of them doing it together, all 12 guys. But the effort and concentration has been there.\\" Rautins is banking on a young team to bring Canada back to its first Olympic basketball appearance since 2000, where the team was lead by Steve Nash and ultimately finished seventh. Now, a new generation of players with ranging NBA experience will lead the team, including guards Carl English and Denham Brown, forwards Juan Mendez, Olu Famutimi and Levon Kendall as well as centre Samuel Dalembert. Rautins is currently using the four-team exhibition tournament in order to establish those younger players in game situations and nail down his best lineups. \\"We have such limited opportunity to give these guys experience that the plan was to just do whatever we can to load them up with whatever we could give them and hopefully this year, next year and the year after really starts to pay dividends,\\" he says. In order to even think about next summer however, Canada will need a strong showing in Las Vegas. Teams that reach the finals at the FIBA Americas automatically get their ticket punched for the 2008 Summer Olympic Games. But the third, fourth and fifth place finishers will have another chance in a tougher World Olympic Qualifying tournament taking place a month before the Games and featuring similar finishers from FIBA Asia, Europe, Africa and Oceania tournaments being played in the next month. Rautins is understandably dreaming big (\\"just like everyone else we're shooting for those top two spots,\\" he says), but even he knows that his team will need to fight through some deficiencies to earn a chance to qualify in 2008. \\"This group has to take advantage of its skills but I think we also have to cover up a few things,\\" says Rautins. \\"We're not particularly strong at point guard and that's something that we've adjusted in how we play. We're kind of playing that position by committee and we've adjusted how we run and how we get into our offence accordingly.\\" Of course, Canada does happen to have a pretty good point guard in Nash, who hasnt ruled out Beijing in 2008 should Canada qualify, but passed on Vegas this summer. \\"[Nash doesn't] need to make excuses, [he's] put in many years with this team,\\" says Rautins. \\"He certainly has left the door open for next year, if we're successful in getting there. With his personality and what he's done, the guys are open and willing to have him come in, even though he might not be there right now.\\" Fellow NBA player Jamaal Magloire once again has declined the invitation to represent Canada in international play, but Rautins says both cases clearly can't be considered in the same context. \\"I've repeatedly tried to communicate with [Magloire] and my last communication was that we were supposed to have a sit-down to talk about it and he never followed through on that,\\" he says. \\"Then, I pick up the newspaper and he indicates that he won't be playing but he's looking forward to joining the team if we qualify. \\"Quite honestly, a lot of this team saw that and they weren't too impressed by that and you know, nor was I. \\"He's a big guy, he's an NBA talent and I wouldn't want to hurt these guys by not having him there. But if they don't feel he belongs there then he won't be there, regardless of what his intentions are.\\" Magloire's skills as a centre might have become easier to live without thanks to the recent addition of Philadelphia 76'ers centre Dalembert to the Canadian team. The Montreal resident, by way of Haiti, was sworn in as a Canadian citizen on Aug. 7, and should provide a true anchor in the post for his newly adopted home country despite his limited international experience. \\"He can run, he can play above the rim and he's a tremendous shot blocker so he's going to present problems for opposing bigs and our job is just to put him in situations where he can catch it on the move and take advantage of people around the basket,\\" says Rautins, who also is cautioning patience with his starting centre given that he's only had two weeks to get ready. \\"He was doing what he can along with other things to potentially prepare but certainly, he's not in mid-season form, so it's going to be interesting to see the adjustment.\\" A strong contribution from Dalembert in Las Vegas could provide a huge boost to a nation desperate to get back Olympic competition but his coach knows that it's going to take more than just the efforts of one player in order for Canada to advance. \\"We have to have some players really step up and play as good as they can play,\\" says Rautins. \\"We need every single player on the same page, not one guy can stray or vary from that and we have to have absolute effort on the defensive end of the floor at all times.\\" The rest of the field Even at its best however, Canada will face a daunting challenge in a tournament that became much more competitive thanks to a result from over a year ago. On Sept. 1, 2006, both the United States and Argentina were dumped from the semi-finals of the 2006 World Championships, allowing Spain to prevail and earn a guaranteed spot in Beijing in the process. So instead of the world No.1 Americans or the defending Olympic champion Argentines treating this trip to the Strip like a working vacation, these basketball superpowers are going to have to go all-out at the University Nevada-Las Vegas' Thomas and Mack Centre. That may be bad news for the rest of the field, but it definitely ups the international intrigue for basketball fans looking for a late-summer fix. Sports Online breaks down the rest of the field for the 2007 FIBA Basketball Americas tournament. The Favourite  United States With all due respect to the defending champs from Argentina, nobody should be betting against the house in this tournament. The U.S. appears poised, reloaded and refocused after its debacle in Athens in 2004, which saw them fail to clinch Olympic gold for the first time since the pre-Dream Team days. That team was led by Tim Duncan and backed by a flock of the NBAs brightest young stars but was exposed against international defensive zones and fizzled to a bronze-medal finish under head coach Larry Brown. But incoming managing director Jerry Colangelo and a revamped coaching staff led by Duke University coach Mike Krzyzewski appear to have worked hard on addressing their weaknesses. While a large degree of improvement can be expected from the development of players like Lebron James, Carmelo Anthony and Chris Bosh, the real difference with this team is the addition of shooters and stability in the backcourt that cost them dearly in 2004. Player to watch: On a team littered with all-world talent barely old enough to enjoy an adult beverage in Las Vegas, the U.S. team should clinch a top-two finish if it can get the best out of the 34-year-old New Jersey Nets floor general Jason Kidd. No other NBA player outside of Steve Nash can elevate the play of his teammates like Kidd. The Olympic gold medalist's ability to run the fast break and pick apart half-court zone defences solves a lot of the issues this team had in Athens. A walking triple-double any time he steps on the floor, Kidd is showing no signs of slowing down as hes coming off one of his finest seasons. The Defending Champs  Argentina Argentina would normally be a lock with the US to advance from this tournament but whos missing from the defending Olympic champs heading into Las Vegas has become just as much of a story as whos going. Missing in action will be current NBA players Manu Ginobili (San Antonio Spurs), Fabricio Oberto (Spurs), Walter Hermann (Charlotte Bobcats) and former NBA point guard Pepe Sanchez. That leaves the bulk of the heavy lifting to guard Carlos Delfino (Toronto Raptors), power forward Luis Scola (Houston Rockets) and small forward Andres Nocioni (Chicago Bulls). Despite the absence of some its best, expect Argentina to still be a handful. Strong team play and an up-tempo style have made the defending Olympic gold medalists one of the strongest international squads on the planet. Player to watch: A versatile swingman, who was shrewdly acquired by Raptors general manager Bryan Colangelo this off-season, Delfino will be required to pick up the scoring and leadership slack in the absence of the dynamic Ginobili. So far, he appears more than capable. At the tune-up Super 4 tournament in Santa Fe, Delfino scored 23 points in the championship game for the Argentines on his way to tournament MVP honours. Perhaps the most underrated team in the tournament, the Brazilians have put together a talented squad that could pull off an upset a team and finish with a guaranteed Olympic berth. Leandro Barbosa of the Phoenix Suns will serve as point guard and the NBAs Sixth Man of the Year will be joined by some talented big men including Spurs first-round pick Tiago Splitter, Anderson Varejao (Cleveland Cavaliers) and Nene (Denver Nuggets). Player to watch: A pretty serious knee blowout in the first game of the 2005 NBA campaign cost Nene well over a season. But he came back in the first half of the 2006 campaign to average 12 points and seven rebounds for Denver during the regular season and upped those numbers in the playoffs. His combined experience with the nuances of the international game as well the talent of the NBA should make him invaluable to Brazils chances. Should contend for the top five and seems to thrive in playing the role of giant killer. A lack of NBA-level talent didnt stop Puerto Rico from thumping the Americans 92-74 at Athens in 2004  handing the U.S. its first Olympic defeat with professionals on its roster and its most lopsided loss against top-flight international competition ever. Puerto Rico has traditionally shown no fear against the bigger kids on the playground and shouldnt be a pushover this time around either. Player to watch: Carlos Arroyos a journeyman in the NBA but nothing short of a warrior when he dons his national team jersey. The 28-year-old former Raptor and current Orlando Magic point guard is now a seasoned veteran for the national team having enjoyed his greatest success at last years World Championships where he averaged 21.2 points, 4.6 rebounds and 5.2 assists per game from that tournament in Brazil. Playing the U.S., in particular, brings out the best in Arroyo. What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"The 2007 FIBA Americas Championship was a basketball tournament for men's national teams that took place in Las Vegas from August 22 to September 2. The competition was important because it helped decide which countries from the Americas would go to the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. Canada had a young team and was hoping to make it to the Olympics for the first time since 2000. The United States and Argentina were strong teams, while Brazil and Puerto Rico were also expected to do well in the tournament."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Question: Gene activation leads to other effects, since the protein products of many of the responding genes include enzymes and factors that increase gene expression. Gene expression factors produced as a result of a cascade can turn on even more genes. Therefore one stimulus can trigger the expression of many genes, and this in turn can lead to the activation of many complex events. In a multicellular organism these events include the increased uptake of glucose from the blood stream (stimulated by insulin), and the movement of neutrophils to sites of infection (stimulated by bacterial products). The set of genes and the order in which they are activated in response to stimuli are often called a genetic program.  Tony decided to cook a large amount of pasta for dinner, a meal that contains a high amount of glucose and will stimulate the release of insulin. Tony eats his meal on the couch, while sitting next to his sister Justine. Justine is not eating a meal, and is just quietly watching television.  Who will more likely be expressing a higher amount of genes at that time? Answer:","output":"Both Tony and Justine will have various genes being expressed continuously at different levels, as all cells in the body require proteins synthesized by gene expression for normal functioning.

The rationale behind this inference is as follows: 1. The consumption of a glucose-rich meal (such as pasta) by Tony will trigger an increase in blood glucose levels in his body. Consequently, his pancreas will produce and release insulin, which will facilitate the uptake of glucose by cells in various tissues. As the level of glucose and insulin rises, cells will in turn activate genes involved in glucose metabolism and energy production, such as glycogen synthesis and glycolysis. 2. The activation of these glucose-responsive genes will likely result in Tony expressing a greater number of genes related to glucose metabolism and energy production. This may lead to a higher overall level of gene expression, as proteins and enzymes are synthesized to facilitate these processes. 3. In addition to the genes directly related to glucose metabolism, there may be other genes expressed as a result of the initial metabolic response. This could be due to the activation of signaling pathways cascades, as you mentioned in the question, leading to the expression of even more genes involved in various cellular processes. On the other hand, Justine, who is not eating a meal and is quietly watching television, would be maintaining her basal level of gene expression required for the normal functioning of cells. While she would still have genes being expressed to maintain cellular activities, her gene expression would not likely experience the same increase in intensity as her brother Tony, who is consuming a high-glucose meal. It is important to note that gene expression is a dynamic and complex process, influenced by many factors such as the cellular context, environmental cues, and the individual's physiological state. Although the consumption of a glucose-rich meal like pasta would likely result in a higher overall level of gene expression for Tony compared to Justine, it would be an oversimplification to conclude that this is the only factor that will determine their respective gene expression levels at that specific moment."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

A VJ(video jockey) is a person who introduces music videos on television.  VJs were first seen on television in the early 1980s when MTV went on the air. As MTV became popular, and the audience for music videos expanded, a variety of other music video channels started broadcasting. In addition to rock music, there were channels for people who had a lot of interest in alternative kinds of music, such as country music, light music, and R&B(rhythm and blues), and all of these channels needed VJs. By the 1990s, international music video channels like Channel V in Asia and VIVA in Europe had started.  The VJs for the new international stations had to be chosen carefully. Although some VJs did shows that focused on small audiences and showed mostly local content, other VJs presented shows for international viewers. These VJs, and the material they presented, needed to be popular in several different cultures.  One successful international VJ in Asia is Asha Gill. She is from prefix = st1 /Malaysia, but her parents and grandparents are fromIndia,FranceandEngland. She speaks three languages and has fans across Asia, fromJapanto theUnited Arab Emirates.  Another VJ who has made a big hit in Asia is Lili. She is actually a computer-  Animated VJ on MTV Asia. An actress wearing special computer equipment makes Lili move like a puppet . The actress also talks for Lili, and her shows can be seen in five languages.  When asked what makes a good video jockey, many successful VJs have given similar answers.

Summarize this article in one sentence. Children learn what they live, making it vital that parents set the right example with their own food choices. If parents are routinely eating and snacking on unhealthy foods, how can children be expected to do any differently? Setting the right example to get children to eat right requires parental self-discipline. Parents need to provide loving and firm guidance in making healthy and wise choices regarding food and snacks. It is most important to eat plenty of vegetables and fruits yourself. If you model positive behaviors, chances are your kids will copy you. Watch your body and facial expression as well when you try something new. In infancy, children often get fruit and vegetable baby foods, once they start eating table food, what you eat is going to be a big influence on what your kids like to eat. If you rarely serve vegetables with meals or eat fruit, don't be surprised if your kids develop the same habit. Children typically do not like changes being made to their routines, so expect children to express their dislike to newly implemented changes in the family meal plan. Calmly explain that “this is what we’re having for dinner”, and if children adamantly refuse to eat the planned meal, simply cover it and save it for when they say they’re hungry. Remember, your home is not a cafeteria-style restaurant where children dictate what they will or will not eat. When the child later says they are hungry, simply say “Well that’s good because I saved your dinner for you”, then reheat as needed. For example, carrots have vitamin A which is good for skin and eyes. Make the connections between food and what it does for our bodies. For example, have them help when making salads or main meals together. They will be able to recognize what they are eating if they get to see it and feel it. It's also a great chance to discuss the food and get to understand its value better.","output":"Parents should set a good example by eating healthy foods themselves, as children tend to copy their parents' eating habits and learn from their choices."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","output":"The hypothesis that \\"You are the bottom,\\" does not entail the premise \\"You're the top.\\" To understand this better, let's break down the concepts of entailment, premises, and hypotheses. Entailment refers to a relationship between statements wherein, if the premises are true, then the conclusion (or hypothesis) must also be true. When a hypothesis is entailed by its premise, it implies that there is a logical connection and coherence between the two. A premise is an initial assertion or assumption made as a basis for reasoning, discussion, or belief. It is used to set the foundation for a logical argument and can be viewed as the starting point. A hypothesis, on the other hand, is a proposed explanation or tentative assumption based on limited evidence. It is an educated guess that can be tested and validated through further investigation, experimentation, or observation. Now, let's analyze the given premise and hypothesis: Premise: \\"You're the top!\\" This premise suggests that you (or someone being referred to) are considered to be the best or superior in a particular context. It asserts that one holds a high position, either literally or metaphorically. Hypothesis: \\"You are the bottom.\\" The hypothesis presents a contradictory statement by claiming that you (or someone being referred to) are not the top but rather at the bottom or inferior. It implies that one holds a low position or rank in the given context. As we can see, the hypothesis contradicts the premise directly. In this case, if the premise is true (\\"You're the top!\\"), it would make the hypothesis false (\\"You are the bottom.\\"), as one cannot be both the top and the bottom simultaneously. This contradiction signifies that the hypothesis does not entail the premise because it fails to provide a coherent or logical connection. In conclusion, the hypothesis \\"You are the bottom\\" is not entailed by the premise \\"You're the top!\\" because of the direct contradiction between the two statements. For entailment to occur, there must be a logical connection between the premise and the hypothesis, which is absent in this case."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q:Process: - Suns heat enters atmosphere - Green house gases enter from the earth - Heat is trapped in atmosphere - Different things on earth are hotter - The overall planet is hotter.  Question: suppose Making meat illegal happens, how will it affect LESS global warming.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect A:","output":"B: Less Making meat production and consumption illegal would have an effect on reducing global warming. The process of meat production, particularly in the case of beef, contributes to greenhouse gas emissions in several ways: 1. Deforestation: Large areas of forests are cleared to create pastures for livestock or grow feed crops. This deforestation results in the release of large amounts of stored carbon into the atmosphere, contributing to global warming. 2. Methane emissions: Ruminant animals, such as cows, produce methane as a byproduct of their digestive process. Methane is a potent greenhouse gas, approximately 28 times more effective at trapping heat in the atmosphere than carbon dioxide over a 100-year period. 3. Manure and fertilizers: The massive amounts of manure produced by livestock, as well as the synthetic fertilizers used for growing feed crops, release nitrous oxide (another potent greenhouse gas) into the atmosphere. 4. Fossil fuel consumption: The process of meat production is energy-intensive and relies on the use of fossil fuels, which produces carbon dioxide as a byproduct. By making meat illegal, the demand for meat and meat products would decrease. This could result in a reduced need for livestock production, which would consequently lead to a decrease in the greenhouse gas emissions associated with meat production. This would in turn have a positive impact on combating global warming, ultimately contributing to less global warming overall. However, it is essential to consider the complex socio-economic and ethical aspects of such a decision and look for alternative solutions to reduce the environmental impact of meat production."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Complete the next sentence: How to buy a mobile home  Decide how much space you need.  Mobile homes come in different sizes with different amounts of bedrooms. Consider how many people will be living in your house and decide how many bedrooms you need.  1). Mobile homes typically come in 3 different sizes, single wide, double wide, and triple wide. Single wides are typically long and narrow with their rooms connecting without hallways.; 2). Have a copy of a listing for each room on your list. You may be able to rent a home as a temporary home or as a home purchase for a family member who will only be living there for a few months or to the next year.; 3). If you will be in a tiny apartment or a five-bedroom house with 20 bedrooms, you would want to think about how many bedrooms are you going to require. Determining how many bedrooms you can realistically have in your new home is a rough estimate.; 4). Most mobile homes will come with their significant other's smart phone or tablet with certain rooms turned into mini-bedrooms. Mobile homes can range from one 2 bedroom home to a house that houses up to two bedrooms.; The answer is:","output":"1). Mobile homes typically come in 3 different sizes, single wide, double wide, and triple wide. Single wides are typically long and narrow with their rooms connecting without hallways. This answer provides the most accurate information related to the size and structure of mobile homes, which is sparked by the preceding text about the need to decide how much space is needed when purchasing a mobile home. It is relevant to note that mobile homes come in varying sizes and configurations, and this choice delves into those specifics—single wide, double wide, and triple wide.  Single-wide mobile homes are typically the smallest, designed long and narrow, offering efficient use of space with rooms often connected directly to one another without hallways. This layout fits well for one person or a small family.  Double-wide mobile homes are larger and offer more space. They are typically made by joining two single sections side by side, creating more room for additional bedrooms or living areas. Their size makes them more apt for larger families or those who desire more space. Triple-wide mobile homes are even larger, manufactured by joining three sections. These are less common but offer substantial space, closely resembling traditional single-family homes in terms of size and layout. Other options mentioned in the multiple-choice list are either irrelevant, confusing, or incorrect. For instance, mobile homes do not typically come with smartphones or tablets, as indicated in the fourth option. The third option seems to imply that the number of bedrooms in one's previous apartment will determine the number of bedrooms in your new mobile home, which isn't necessarily true. Housing a family member temporarily (option two) doesn't specifically relate to deciding on the size of the mobile home to buy.  Thus, option one is the most commonsensical answer to the question, as it appropriately continues the narrative on how to consider the size of a mobile home based upon an individual or family's needs. This answer gives the potential buyer the most practical understanding of the sizes of mobile homes available in the market and thus directs their decision-making process."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

And taxing people 's income is the same as punishing their income . When you punish an activity less , you should n't be surprised to see that people voluntarily engage in that activity more often . Want Americans to earn more ? Based on the preceding passage, answer the following question What type of ideology is the narrator showing ?","output":"The narrator appears to be demonstrating a libertarian or laissez-faire capitalist ideology. This type of ideology generally advocates for minimal government intervention in the economy and promotes individual freedom and responsibility as the primary drivers of a successful society. The narrator's emphasis on the idea that people should be rewarded rather than punished for earning income, and that taxation can be seen as a form of punishment, reflects the underlying belief in the power of free markets and individual incentives. This ideological perspective values the pursuit of self-interest, as it is believed that this will lead to overall societal benefits through increased productivity and wealth generation. Additionally, the narrator implies that if the government reduces its role in regulating income through taxes, people will be more inclined to earn more money and contribute to the overall economic success of the nation. This further aligns with the ideas of libertarianism and laissez-faire capitalism, as it places trust in the individual's capacity to make rational and beneficial choices without the need for government interventions or regulations. In conclusion, the narrator's focus on rewarding rather than punishing income, their belief in the positive outcomes of reduced taxation, and their advocacy for individuals to engage more actively in income-generating activities all point towards a libertarian or laissez-faire capitalist ideology."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Monica and Jill are two friends.

Andrea: That's kind of an unusual idea, but I see where you're coming from. So, which not-so-favorable pictures should we send him? Julián: Let's start with the obvious – traffic during the rush hour. We can send him a picture of Avenida 9 de Julio with all the buses, cars, and people trying to cross the street. Andrea: Right, and I bet he won't miss the noise and chaos of public transport here. Oh, and speaking of noise, we could share a photo of a construction site, with all the drilling and hammering sounds that accompany it. Julián: Good idea! I also thought about sharing pictures of some streets after a heavy rain, you know, with all the flooded sidewalks and people trying to navigate their way through them. It can get pretty messy and dirty in Buenos Aires after a rainfall. Andrea: Definitely, and we all know how common power outages can be in the city, especially during the summer months. We should send him a photo of a pitch-black neighborhood with no electricity and remind him of those hot, stuffy nights without air conditioning. Julián: Haha, that's true! Oh, what about sharing pictures of those massive lines at banks and ATMs during a busy day? He'll remember the frustration of having to wait in long queues for simple transactions. Andrea: We can't forget about the strike days when everything comes to a halt, and the city is filled with protest marches, road closures, and a general state of chaos. We can send him a picture of that too. Julián: Great idea! And for the last image, we should send him a photo of the graffiti and trash that, unfortunately, sometimes adorn the streets of our beloved city. Andrea: Yeah, it's sad but true. Alright, so we have our list of photos to send to Callum. Hopefully, it will help to lessen his longing for the city, at least a little bit.

Most people over 65 have retired from work, freeing up their time for hobbies, grandchildren, and other interests. Stamina, strength, reflex time, and the senses all decline during old age, and the number of brain cells decreases as well. The immune system becomes less efficient, increasing the risk of serious illnesses such as cancer and pneumonia. Diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease that cause loss of mental function also become more common. The answer is:","output":"Group Y had people with stronger immune systems. This is because the paragraph mentions that during old age, which begins in the mid-60s, the immune system becomes less efficient, increasing the risk of serious illnesses such as cancer and pneumonia. Group D consists of people over 65 years old, who are more likely to experience a decline in their immune system as part of the aging process.

Answer the following question: Information:  - Pinyin, or Hàny Pnyn, is the official romanization system for Standard Chinese in mainland China, Malaysia, Singapore, and Taiwan. It is often used to teach Standard Chinese, which is normally written using Chinese characters. The system includes four diacritics denoting tones. Pinyin without tone marks is used to spell Chinese names and words in languages written with the Latin alphabet, and also in certain computer input methods to enter Chinese characters.  - Korla, Kurla, or Kuerle ( lit. Krorain) is a mid-sized city in central Xinjiang, and is, administratively, a county-level city and the seat of the Bayin'gholin Mongol Autonomous Prefecture, which is larger than Great Britain and is the largest Chinese prefecture. Korla is known for its \\"fragrant\\" pears.  - In geography, an oasis (plural: oases) is an isolated area of vegetation in a desert, typically surrounding a spring or similar water source, such as a pond or small lake. Oases also provide habitat for animals and even humans if the area is big enough. The location of oases has been of critical importance for trade and transportation routes in desert areas; caravans must travel via oases so that supplies of water and food can be replenished. Thus, political or military control of an oasis has in many cases meant control of trade on a particular route. For example, the oases of Awjila, Ghadames, and Kufra, situated in modern-day Libya, have at various times been vital to both North-South and East-West trade in the Sahara Desert.  - China, officially the People's Republic of China (PRC), is a unitary sovereign state in East Asia. With a population of over 1.381 billion, it is the world's most populous country. The state is governed by the Communist Party of China, and its capital is Beijing. It exercises jurisdiction over 22 provinces, five autonomous regions, four direct-controlled municipalities (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Chongqing), and two mostly self-governing special administrative regions (Hong Kong and Macau), and claims sovereignty over Taiwan. The country's major urban areas include Shanghai, Guangzhou, Beijing, Chongqing, Shenzhen, Tianjin and Hong Kong. China is a great power and a major regional power within Asia, and has been characterized as a potential superpower.  - Lop Nur or Lop Nor (from a Mongolian name meaning \\"Lop Lake\\") is a former salt lake in China, now largely dried-up, located between the Taklamakan and Kumtag deserts in the southeastern portion of Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region in the People's Republic of China. Administratively, the lake is in Lop Nur township (pinyin: Luóbùp zhèn, also known as Luozhong , pinyin: Lu zhng) of Ruoqiang County, which in its turn is part of the Bayingolin Mongol Autonomous Prefecture.  - Libya (\\"\\") is a country in the Maghreb region of North Africa, bordered by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, Egypt to the east, Sudan to the southeast, Chad and Niger to the south, and Algeria and Tunisia to the west. The three traditional parts of the country are Tripolitania, Fezzan and Cyrenaica. With an area of almost , Libya is the fourth largest country in Africa, and is the 16th largest country in the world. Libya has the 10th-largest proven oil reserves of any country in the world.  - Loulan , also called Krorän or Kroraina ( simplified Chinese :  ; traditional Chinese :  ; pinyin : Lóulán ; Uyghur :   , ULY : Kroran ) , and known to Russian archaeologists as Krorayina , was an ancient kingdom based around an important oasis city along the Silk Road already known in the 2nd century BCE on the north - eastern edge of the Lop Desert . The term Loulan is the Chinese transcription of the native name Krorän , and is used to refer to the city located near Lop Nur as well as the kingdom . The kingdom was renamed Shanshan (  ) after its king was assassinated by an envoy of the Han dynasty in 77 BCE ; however , the town at the northwestern corner of the brackish desert lake Lop Nur retained the name of Loulan . The kingdom included at various times settlements such as Niya , Charklik , Miran , and Qiemo . It was intermittently under Chinese control from the early Han dynasty until its abandonment centuries later . The ruins of Loulan are near the now desiccated Lop Nur in the Bayingolin Mongol Autonomous Prefecture , Xinjiang , and are now completely surrounded by desert .  - The Silk Road or Silk Route was an ancient network of trade routes that were for centuries central to cultural interaction through regions of the Asian continent connecting the East and West from China to the Mediterranean Sea.  - Bayingolin Mongol Autonomous Prefecture, often abbreviated to Bayingol (literally \\"rich river\\"), is an autonomous prefecture of the People's Republic of China, bordering Gansu to the east, Qinghai to the southeast, and the Tibet Autonomous Region to the south. It is the largest prefecture-level division nationally, with an area of , even larger than its neighbouring province of Gansu. The prefectural capital is Korla.  - Trade, or commerce, involves the transfer of goods and/or services from one person or entity to another, often in exchange for money. A network that allows trade is called a market.  - A desert is a barren area of land where little precipitation occurs and consequently living conditions are hostile for plant and animal life. The lack of vegetation exposes the unprotected surface of the ground to the processes of denudation. About one third of the land surface of the world is arid or semi-arid. This includes much of the polar regions where little precipitation occurs and which are sometimes called polar deserts or \\"cold deserts\\". Deserts can be classified by the amount of precipitation that falls, by the temperature that prevails, by the causes of desertification or by their geographical location.  - Ruoqiang (Qarkilik) County (historically known as Charkliq, Chaqiliq, or Qakilik) is a county in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, China under the administration of the Bayingolin Mongol Autonomous Prefecture. It covers an area of (about twice the size of Zhejiang province and similar to Kyrgyzstan or Senegal), making it the largest county-level division in the country.  - The Tarim Basin is an endorheic basin in northwest China occupying an area of about . Located in China's Xinjiang region, it is sometimes used synonymously to refer the southern half of the province, or Nanjiang. Its northern boundary is the Tian Shan mountain range and its southern boundary is the Kunlun Mountains on the edge of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. The Taklamakan Desert dominates much of the basin. The historical Uyghur name for the Tarim Basin is Altishahr (), which means \\"six cities\\" in Uyghur.  - Geography (from Greek , \\"geographia\\", literally \\"earth description\\") is a field of science devoted to the study of the lands, the features, the inhabitants, and the phenomena of Earth. The first person to use the word \\"\\" was Eratosthenes (276194 BC). Geography is an all-encompassing discipline that seeks an understanding of the Earth and its human and natural complexitiesnot merely where objects are, but how they have changed and come to be. It is often defined in terms of the two branches of human geography and physical geography. The four historical traditions in geographical research are: spatial analyses of natural and the human phenomena, area studies of places and regions, studies of human-land relationships, and the Earth sciences. Geography has been called \\"the world discipline\\" and \\"the bridge between the human and the physical sciences\\".  - The Lop Desert, or the Lop Depression, is a desert extending from Korla eastwards along the foot of the Kuruk-tagh (meaning Dry Mountain) to the formerly terminal Tarim Basin in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region of China. It is an almost perfectly flat expanse with no topographic relief. Lake Bosten in the northwest lies at an altitude of 1,030 m to 1,040 m (3,380 to 3,410 ft), while the Lop Nur in the southeast is only 250 m lower.  - Awjila (Berber: \\"Awilan\\", \\"Awjila\\", \\"Awgila\\" Latin: \\"Augila\\") is an oasis town in the Al Wahat District in the Cyrenaica region of northeastern Libya. Since classical times it has been known as a place where high quality dates are farmed. From the Arab conquest in the 7th century, Islam has played an important role in the community. The oasis is located on the east-west caravan route between Egypt and Tripoli, and on the north-south route between Benghazi and the Sahel between Lake Chad and Darfur, and in the past was an important trading center. It is the place after which the Awjila language, an Eastern Berber language, is named. The people cultivate small gardens using water from deep wells. Recently, the oil industry has become an increasingly important source of employment.  - Ghadames or Ghadamis (Berber: \\"ademis\\"; \\"admis\\", Libyan vernacular: \\"dms\\", Latin: \\"Cidamus, Cydamus\\") is an oasis Berber town in the Nalut District of the Tripolitania region in northwestern Libya.  - Kufra is a basin and oasis group in the Kufra District of southeastern Cyrenaica in Libya. At the end of nineteenth century Kufra became the center and holy place of the Senussi order. It also played a minor role in the Western Desert Campaign of World War II.

To say the least he was annoying. He'd take the liberty to hide my backpack, borrow my books without consent, doodle scandalous stuff on my notebooks with a pen and yada yada. So one day, I was showing this cool trick I learned on an anatomy program on the TV to a couple of classmates who used to sit around me. The thing was that you can't flex your ring finger upwards if you put your middle finger under the palm (try that) We were all kids, and soon everyone in the class started staring at us weirdos looking laughing at out hands. The bully noticed it too, and came near to inquire about this hand stuff. I described the trick and he was impressed. And then, I saw our teacher walking up the corridor, just a couple paces behind the class door. So, I asked him (the bully) if he wanted to see another trick and to that he nodded a big yes. Cool, What I did was, that I grabbed his right arm by the thumb and put it on my throat right above the larynx. Then I quickly shifted my grip to his wrist. He without batting an eye, asked what I was doing, but then I started beating the desk with my other hand and made squeaking noises while pushing his hand against my throat harder with every turning head. And voilà! Every one in the class (including the teacher) thought he was smothering me. After a few ifs and buts between him and the teacher, he was summoned at the principal’s chambers, from where, later he was sent home, where presumably judging from the look on his face for the next few days, he was beat to crap by his folks.

Title: great cookie cutter set! Review: I make ice cream sandwiches and needed to create a uniform size cookie, so I purchased this cookie cutter set. So far I have only used 2 of the sizes, but with the holidays approaching I'm am anxious to try out the smaller sizes. Overall, the quality of the cutting set is very good. The top edges of the cutters are rounded, so they don't hurt your hands if you are pressing into something more substantial than dough. In the future I'll probably purchase another set of these cookie cutters with scalloped edges (Ateco 6-Piece Double Sided Round Cutter Set). Very fun!","output":"Based on the customer's review, it is clear that they are satisfied with the product. The customer mentions that they have used the cookie cutter set successfully for their ice cream sandwiches, appreciates the quality of the set, and finds the rounded edges of the cutters comfortable to use.

Choose your answer: is the following review positive or negative? I normally color my own hair but I was looking for a major change - going from blond to wanting to add a lot of brown with blond highlights.  I was referred to this salon and told they would do a cut and color for 45.  As a single mom, that price was right up my alley.  I met with Gavin and I thought he really listened to what I was looking for and what I really didn't want.  I was very clear that I did not want my hair to be ashy in any way, shape or form, that I was looking for a very rich brown and if he didn't think that would work to please let me know.    In regards to my cut I showed him some other ideas but told him I was open.  He said he didn't really know what to do about the cut but we would talk about that after he did the color.   He looked at the photos I brought in and told me some of the color ideas I brought may be too dark and he acted like he understood what I wanted.  In hindsight, I did the majority of talking and he really didn't talk to me about what colors would work best nor did he show me any samples of color. He mixed up color and came back and started working on my hair.  He was very pleasant and made a bit of small talk.  He seemed to be very thorough with the application but I did notice that he didn't seem to be putting the color all the way to my roots (and there were grays that needed to be covered) but it's been a long time since I've had my hair done professionally and I figured it was o.k.   One comment he made while doing my hair was that the lighting in the salon was not very good.  He said when he does blondes a lot of them freak out because they see red tones in their hair, which he says is due to the lighting.   When he took the foils out it was hard to get a good idea of the true color (due to the lighting and it was dark outside which made the salon dark) but the ends looked really, really dark.  He still had no ideas on what to do with my hair and trimmed the back and told me he would do the bangs and angle the sides toward my face.   He didn't seem to spend much time on the front of my hair and then said he wanted to blow dry it and see where we were and he'd finish the cut from there.  He was blow drying and it seemed like all of a sudden he was bored, stopped and said we were done.  He never checked the cut in the front and didn't even brush it out - just stopped blow drying.   I went to give him my debit card only to be told that he forgot the card swipper for his phone at home.  I had to go to the bank, get cash and run it back.  When I got home and looked at my hair in real light I about cried.   The color was ALL ash and large sections were extremely dark, like the hair grabbed too much color.  Pretty much everything I said I didn't want.   My bangs are too short to pull over to the side, I have 2 clumps of hair on either side of my head that end at about my cheekbones - there does not seem to be any angling or layering at all.   I noticed today that when I pull my hair up you can see all the gray at my roots - he didn't color the roots at all (which reminds me, toward the end of my cut he told me if I wanted to use my box color to touch up the roots, I could - what stylist tells their client they can do that??) I tried calling to give him a chance to fix it. (I can't afford to go to another salon to have the cut and color fixed) When I did Frank answered and asked me to call back the next morning at 9 a.m.  I did as I was asked and was told that Gavin hadn't come in yet but Frank took my name and number and said he would have Gavin call me.  That was 3 days ago and I'm still waiting. Select from: + negative; + positive;","output":"- negative The review is negative because the customer was not happy with the color and cut of her hair. She mentioned that the color turned out to be the opposite of what she wanted, and there were issues with the haircut as well. Also, she faced inconvenience while trying to pay and had a difficult time contacting the stylist to fix the problem. All of these reasons make her experience a negative one.

Question: What may happen after this situation ?","output":"Step 1: Assess the current state of the baggage Before deciding what to do next, I will examine the contents of the baggage to determine how full it truly is. This will give me an idea of the available space for the newly bought chocolates and whether I need to reorganize the contents. Step 2: Prioritize items in the baggage Once I have a clear understanding of the baggage's contents, I will prioritize the items based on their importance for the trip. This can help me decide which items are absolutely necessary, and which can potentially be left behind to make room for the chocolates or any other additional items. Step 3: Reorganize the contents of the baggage With the list of prioritized items, I can now reorganize the contents of the baggage to maximize space utilization. This may involve rolling clothes instead of folding them or using packing cubes to compartmentalize items. I may also need to remove any unnecessary items to create additional space. Step 4: Add the chocolates to the baggage Now that I have optimized the arrangement of the baggage, I can locate an appropriate space for the chocolates. I will ensure they are packed securely and protected from melting or getting crushed by other items in the baggage. Step 5: Consider checking in extra baggage (if necessary) If, after reorganizing and prioritizing the contents of the baggage, there is still not enough space for the chocolates or any other essential items, I may need to consider checking in an extra piece of luggage. This additional baggage will allow for more space and ensure a stress-free packing experience. Conclusion: After this situation, the individual will likely have successfully rearranged their baggage to accommodate the chocolates and may have needed to pack an additional piece of luggage. By prioritizing and reorganizing their baggage, they can enjoy their two-week vacation knowing they have packed both essential items and desired treats."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Santorum Will Have to Answer on Satan      RUSH: I mentioned earlier in the program that Santorum, people have dug deep and they found a speech that he gave back in 2008 in Ave Maria, Florida, at Ave Maria University. Drudge has this plastered up. The Democrats have found it. It’s all over the place. Think Progress and whatever leftist think tanks have dug this up, and it’s part of the predictable attempt to impugn Santorum as an absolute religious nut and wacko. But he did say these things and he’ll to have an answer for these things when queried. Let’s play these sound bites. We have three of them. This is where Santorum has said that Satan has set his sights on America. Again, this is at Ave Maria University, August of 2008, in Ave Maria, Florida.            SANTORUM: The Father of Lies has his sights on what you would think the Father of Lies, Satan, would have his sights on: a good, decent, powerful, influential country — the United States of America. If you were Satan, who would you attack in this day and age? There is no one else to go after other than the United States, and that’s been the case for now almost 200 years, once America’s preeminence was sown by our great Founding Fathers.      RUSH: Okay, so he said it. Can we take you back to the United Nations? What was it, 2000… I don’t know, three or four or five or six. Hugo Chavez shows up, he speaks either the afternoon Bush spoke earlier or the next day, but he gets to the microphone at the United Nations and the General Assembly and starts sniffing around. (Sniffing) He says, “I can still smell the sulfur. The Devil was here,” and he had accused Bush of being the Devil. And the assembled monsters that look like they’re out of Star Wars bar scene that made up the UN General Assembly all started laughing. So we’re back to the double standard. Hugo Chavez can show up and call George W. Bush Satan. “Hey, hey! You know what, that’s right! That’s great. Let’s laugh about it. Let’s applaud it.” Santorum gives a speech in Ave Maria, Florida, back in 2008. “Oh, my God, we’re dealing with a nutcase! Oh, wow, what a fanatic weirdo. What are we gonna get next, an exorcism?” So the double standard does exist. Here’s more from the same speech from Santorum.      SANTORUM: Satan has done so by attacking the great institutions of America, using those great vices of pride, vanity, and sensuality as the root to attack all of these strong plants that have so deeply rooted in American tradition. He was successful. The place where he was, in my mind, the most successful and first successful was in academia. He understood pride of “smart” people. He attacked them at their weakest, that they were in fact smarter than everybody else and could come up with something new and different, pursue new truths, deny the existence of truth, play with it, “because we’re smart;” and so academia a long time ago fell.      RUSH: Satan conquered academia: Rick Santorum, August 29, 2008. And it was in 2006, September 20th, to be exact, where Hugo Chavez strode confidently to the microphones of the UN and was sniffing around and said, “The Devil came here yesterday. It still smells of sulfur today.” And let’s not forget, ladies and gentlemen, Saul Alinsky, who’s the primary mentor of “Barack Hussein Obama! Mmm, mmm, mmm!” Saul Alinsky, the author of the book Rules for Radicals — a book about which Hillary Clinton wrote her masters or doctoral thesis, whatever it was, when she was at Wellesley. Saul Alinsky, who Obama has studied and implements to this day and whose tactics he taught while ostensibly teaching law at the University of Chicago.      Saul Alinsky dedicated his book that all these leftists love to Lucifer, the Devil! Here’s Alinsky’s dedication: “Lest we forget, at least an over the-shoulder acknowledgement to the very first radical from all our legends, mythology and history — and who is to know where mythology leaves off and history begins or which is which? The first radical known to man who rebelled against the establishment and did it so effectively that he at least won his own kingdom: Lucifer.” Saul Alinsky made that dedication in his book Rules for Radicals. So Santorum is just joining the crowd here in discussing this. Here is the final sound bite.      SANTORUM: The next was the church. Now, you say, “Well, wait. The Catholic Church?” No. We all know that this country was founded on a Judeo-Christian ethic, but the Judeo-Christian ethic was a Protestant Judeo-Christian ethic. Sure, the Catholics had some influence, but this was a Protestant country, and the Protestant ethic. Mainstream, mainline Protestantism. And of course we look at the shape of mainline Protestantism in this country, and it is a shambles.      RUSH: That’s Rick Santorum August 29, 2008. That stuff is out there. It’s headlined on Drudge and the left has it, and Santorum will have to deal with it. He’ll have to answer it. I don’t know. It’s just not the kind of stuff you hear a presidential candidate talk about. It’s not ordinary in that sense. Snerdley says, “Yeah, yeah, it’s kind of refreshing.” Snerdley likes devil stuff. I mean, he watches movies about it. He has The Exorcist on a loop at home and it helps with his sciatic pain. ||||| (Jay Westcott/POLITICO)      Matt Drudge has led his site for several hours with a speech Rick Santorum gave in 2008 at Ave Maria University in Florida, in which he talked about Satan having his \\"sights on\\" the United States.      It's a familiar speech for longtime Santorum-watchers, and it popped up a bit on the Web last week before Drudge's posting. It's a piece of information that will be used to fill in the blanks on Santorum for a nation of voters that knows him mostly for old culture war headlines and little else, and at a time when he's surging in polls as the last real Mitt Romney alternative standing in the GOP field.      Per ABC News, the full quotes came in a speech in which Santorum said that the issue of denying communion to politicians supporting abortion rights related to a \\"spiritual war:\\"      “While we all see all this as a great political conflict in warfare between the Obama camp and the McCain camp and culture wars, what Bishop Aquila put his finger on and what I think, I suspect those of you who are here understand, this is not a political war at all. This is not a cultural war. This is a spiritual war,” Santorum said.      “And the Father of Lies has his sights on what you would think the Father of Lies would have his sights on: a good, decent, powerful, influential country, the United States of America. If you were Satan, who would you attack in this day and age. There is no one else to go after other than the United States and that has been the case now for almost 200 years, once America’s preeminence was sown by our great Founding Fathers.”      Rush Limbaugh talked about it on his show, saying the former senator is going to have to explain it: \\"That stuff is out there. It's headlined on Drudge and the left has it, and Santorum will have to deal with it. He'll have to answer it. I don't know. It's just not the kind of stuff you hear a presidential candidate talk about. It's not ordinary in that sense.\\"      I've emailed a Santorum spokesman and haven't heard back. ||||| Rick Santorum was sitting at the center of the Drudge Report's homepage Tuesday afternoon looking like a religious nut. \\"SANTORUM'S SATAN WARNING,\\" the headline screamed, under a black-and-white photo of the candidate standing behind a lectern with a cross on it. The conservative blogger drives mad crazy traffic, and he's using it to attack the biggest threat to his reported ally, Mitt Romney. This isn't the first time Drudge has gone nuclear on a Republican who threatened Romney's candidacy.      Drudge is making Santorum look like the scary mom from Carrie, pulling up several Santorum quotes from 2008. Those include \\"Satan is attacking the great institutions of America, using those great vices of pride, vanity, and sensuality as the root to attack all of the strong plants that has so deeply rooted in the American tradition,\\" as well as \\"We look at the shape of mainline Protestantism in this country and it is in shambles, it is gone from the world of Christianity as I see it.\\"      Drudge has used the same tools—screamer headlines, old photos—to take down another candidate who looked like he might beat Romney. Just as today's post goes after one of Santorum's strengths, his faith, a month ago Drudge published a ton of research attacking Newt Gingrich's strength, his experience. In late January, Gingrich was peaking in the polls, and Drudge's assault caused blogger Matt Barber to rant about \\"The Drudge Distort.\\"      Drudge on January 25:      Note the same use of black and white to make an uninteresting photo look sinister. Gingrich peaked the day before this headline ran, according to Talking Points Memo's poll average:      Of course, Drudge didn't cause Gingrich to fall in the polls all by himself. And maybe the site reflects what the most conservative parts of the conservative establishment are already thinking. Santorum has been ahead of Romney in at least the last six national polls. Maybe some -- or at least the Romney campaign -- are nervous Santorum could actually win. That may explain why while Drudge is attacking Santorum for being too Christian, a Romney adviser is attacking the candidate for not being Christian enough. Mark DeMoss is an outside evangelical adviser to the Romney campaign, Politico reports, and says that Santorum's lack of big charitable donations \\"shows a lack of personal commitment to a principle that religious conservatives and political conservatives believe in.\\" Sure, these accusations are contradictory, but one of them has to stick, right?

Elspeth Reeve |||||Summary:","output":"In 2008, Rick Santorum gave a speech at Ave Maria University in Florida, discussing the role of Satan in attacking the United States. The speech has now resurfaced, and as Santorum is running for president, he will need to address these statements. It has created a double standard, as others have spoken about Satan in relation to politics without the same level of scrutiny. Santorum's speech also touched on the Catholic Church and the idea that the United States was founded on a Protestant Judeo-Christian ethic. The speech reflects an aspect of Santorum's faith and belief system, and he must now clarify his views as a presidential candidate."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

A BRUTAL attack takes place on live television; the on-air reporter and cameraman are fatally shot while at work on an early morning story. The resulting footage — essentially a stomach-churning snuff film — aired on cable news, and was embedded in online news reports. In a further grotesque twist, the killer filmed the episode and posted his first-person shooter video on social media. “See Facebook,” he tweeted, directing readers to the video that he also posted on Twitter, and which auto-played on many streams as people shared the posts. This is probably exactly what the shooter, who took two lives and then his own on Wednesday in Virginia, was hoping for in his engineering of mass media and viral infamy. And he is not the only one. Studies show a rise in public mass shootings in the years since the 1999 killings at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo. These incidents are often followed by discussions of the availability of guns, and about mental health support. Those are crucial issues. But there is something else going on, too: Many of these shooters are seeking a twisted form of notoriety. The killers’ success in obtaining the distorted fame they seek is helping inspire the next troubled person. We need to understand the copycat aspect of these killings so that we can start dampening this effect. After studying 160 “active shooter” events over the past decade, with access to information beyond what the public knows, Andre Simons, of the F.B.I.’s Behavioral Analysis Unit, concluded that “the copycat phenomenon is real.” When the F.B.I. report summarizing the research was released in 2014, he said: “We think we’re seeing more compromised, marginalized individuals who are seeking inspiration from those past attacks.” While we can’t know most killers’ exact motives, we can study their actions. On the morning he fatally shot two people, the Virginia shooter is believed to have faxed a 23-page document to ABC News. The document lionized other young men who had earlier taken multiple lives — men whose actions, motivations and inspirations had been sensationally documented in the news media. He even compared their “tally” of deaths, praising the Virginia Tech shooter for murdering “double the amount” of the Columbine killers. Like many of these individuals, he seemed deeply interested in ensuring a perverse notoriety for his own brutal acts, as well as for past incidents. The troubled young man who killed 20 elementary school students in Newtown, Conn., in 2012 meticulously collected news clippings of previous mass killings. The teenager who killed two people in a Maryland shopping mall in 2014 was obsessed with the Columbine massacre — he even waited till the exact time of its occurrence to start shooting. During the trial of the gunman who committed the Aurora, Colo., theater massacre, as news coverage of the event spiked, two more shootings happened in movie theaters in just two weeks. The gunman in Santa Barbara, Calif., who killed six people in 2014 left behind a carefully prepared video screed (which many media outlets played or linked to). We’ve long known that media reporting of suicides creates a contagion effect by planting what’s known as “the seeds of ideation” in at-risk individuals. Recently, Arizona State University researchers examined whether mass killings and school shootings were similarly contagious. After examining a database of school shootings and mass killings, the researchers reported “significant evidence of contagion.” The occurrence of one mass killing meant that another one in the next two weeks was significantly more likely compared with when there had been no such event in the recent past. Crucially, the next one did not necessarily occur nearby, which is what we’d expect if the contagion effect was a result of word-of-mouth or local news. The researchers concluded that high-profile events that got widespread media attention seemed to inspire the next ones. Psychiatrists agree with the F.B.I.’s conclusion and statistical studies. In 2007, the American Psychiatric Association weighed in, saying that “the scientific evidence in this area is clear.” Asking the news media to stop airing the “disturbing writings, photographs and video” of the Virginia Tech killer, the A.P.A. said that publicizing these materials “seriously jeopardizes the public’s safety by potentially inciting ‘copycat’ suicides, homicides and other incidents.” Attention seeking is not a new kind of behavior, but now those who seek attention via infamy have more tools available than ever. They can film their own manifestoes, as did the Virginia Tech shooter, who killed 32 people. They can post their grievances on social media themselves, as did the Santa Barbara shooter, who killed six people. They can even film the shootings from their own vantage point, as Wednesday’s live-television shooter did. These killers act knowing that their ploy is likely to work, and that their faces, words and vicious deeds will be splashed on our screens on their terms. We can change this by changing the way we cover these stories, similar to the way that the news media did for suicides. After a rash of copycat suicides in the early 1980s, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued voluntary guidelines for reporting on such events: Emphasize that help is possible, do not romanticize the act and do not report on details of the method. (Research shows that being able to imagine an act in specific terms makes it more likely that someone will carry out their plans.) The media needs to adopt a similar sensible framework to covering mass killings. And in the age of social media, that also means changing our own behavior. This doesn’t mean censoring the news or not reporting important events of obvious news value. It means not providing the killers with the infamy they seek. It means somber, instead of lurid and graphic, coverage, and a focus on victims. It means not putting the killer’s face on loop. It means minimizing or not using the killers’ names, as I have done here. It means not airing snuff films, or making them easily accessible on popular sites. It means holding back reporting of details such as the type of gun, ammunition, angle of attack and the protective gear the killer might have worn. Such detailed reporting can give the next killer a concrete road map. This may seem unrealistic. Our media culture tends toward more, not less. But nothing is inevitable, and once awareness of the copycat impact is raised, the news media can change its behavior. It’s not true that the media never holds back information or changes its coverage when lives are at stake. Reporting of suicides already generally follows the C.D.C. guidelines. And, back in 2012, when NBC’s high-profile foreign correspondent, Richard Engel, was kidnapped in Syria, the fact of the abduction was widely known among journalists. But almost all of them complied with NBC’s request for a news blackout to ensure better fact-finding and easier negotiations with the captors. The kidnapping became widely known only after Mr. Engel and his colleagues escaped. The framework necessary to dampen the copycat effect is nowhere as severe as such a blackout. Instead, it requires not giving the killers the fame they most likely seek for their face or for their words or videos, while reporting on the news with a focus on victims and the brutality of the crime. For the rest of us, it means not sharing manifestoes or shooters’ social media accounts. Such change is possible. Brutal beheadings by the Islamic State used to be covered graphically by the news media, and also shared widely on social media. Recently, each such event in my social media feed has been followed by reminders not to share the videos — and almost nobody in my social network does anymore. Instead, we share pictures from the lives of the victims. It’s true that this material will live on in many places on the Internet, but having to seek it in a seedy corner is different from having it promoted by popular news sites. Graphic footage may be appropriate at times to shock the conscience toward corrective action, for example with victims of war or state violence. But when a murder is carried out in a way that seems to be courting sensationalized coverage, not publicizing the killer’s name, face or screeds is the right response. These killers seek our attention. It’s time we learned how to deny them.

What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"The Virginia shooter who took the lives of two people and then his own was seeking a twisted form of notoriety. Copycat killings have been on the rise since the 1999 Columbine High School shooting, leading to discussions of gun control and mental health support. The FBI's Behavioral Analysis Unit has concluded that the copycat phenomenon is real, with many killers seeking fame through their gruesome acts. The media needs to change the way it reports on these incidents, minimizing the killer's names and faces, and focusing on the victims.

The larval sac is opened by the surgeons to reveal a seemingly normal human baby inside.The baby is named \\"Martin\\" by the scientists. He begins to age much faster than a normal human; the company's CEO, Bartok, tells him that this is due to an extremely rare disease called \\"Brundle's Accelerated Growth Syndrome\\", caused by inherited mutant DNA from his father (hence the disease's name). Martin is just as much of a genius as his father, and Bartok wants him to finish the work Seth started. One day, Martin sneaks into a room where animals are held for testing, and befriends a Golden Retriever. He slips out of his room one day to bring the dog some of his dinner, but he finds that it has been transferred to another section.

A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively. There are only six actions: 'I_LOOK', 'I_WALK', 'I_RUN', 'I_JUMP', 'I_TURN_LEFT', and 'I_TURN_RIGHT'.

Because of this, Los Angeles is able to power many of its buildings and factories using renewable resources. Las Vegas, however, receives barely any sunlight or wind throughout the entire year. As a result, they use little renewable resources and instead power most of the city through non-renewable resources like fossil fuels.  Which city, Los Angeles or Las Vegas, emits less greenhouse gases? A:","output":"A: Los Angeles emits less greenhouse gases compared to Las Vegas due to its higher reliance on renewable energy sources. As stated, Los Angeles receives a steady supply of sunlight and wind throughout the year, enabling the city to generate a significant amount of renewable energy to power its buildings and factories. This reduces the dependency on non-renewable resources like fossil fuels, which are major contributors to greenhouse gas emissions. On the other hand, Las Vegas lacks sufficient sunlight and wind, leading to a higher dependence on non-renewable energy sources. As a result, the city emits more greenhouse gases than Los Angeles, considering the carbon footprint associated with the burning of fossil fuels. It is worth noting that the total greenhouse gas emissions for a city may also vary based on factors like population, industry, and transportation habits, but due to the fundamental differences in energy sources, Los Angeles would generally emit less greenhouse gases thanks to its reliance on renewable resources."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

The company revealed its Web ambitions Thursday in a keynote speech reminiscent of Apple’s slickly produced presentations, as CEO Mark Zuckerberg outlined the company’s next stage. Facebook is aiming to become an all-inclusive Web portal for news, music and movies, letting developers build apps that will update users profiles in real-time. And all those interests will be prominently displayed on a splashy new profile page called the “Timeline,” which pulls together all the content you have on Facebook into one, deep page. The Timeline has three main components,Zuckerberg said --- all your stories, all your apps and a new way to express who you are. Pictures and videos are featured prominently, making profiles much more visually focused, and users can sort through the feed by date, type of media and location. Users can customize the top of their timeline, called a “cover” — a large photo at the top of the profile that will look familiar to anyone with a blog. In fact, the whole profile looks more like a blog, which fits in with Facebook’s decision to extend the limit on user updates to 5,000 characters. Facebook is also trying to change the way people get news. Zuckerberg revealed that the site is partnering with news outlets such as Yahoo News, The Daily and, yes, The Washington Post. Users will be able to click on an item in a news stream and read it on the site without ever leaving the social network. They can also read what their friends are reading and find new content based on suggestions. “This new app is fun,” said Donald Graham, chairman and chief executive of The Washington Post Co. “If you know that several of your friends have read a story, you’ll be more interested in it.” Graham is also a member of Facebook’s board of directors This level of sharing also applies to music, through partnerships with companies such as Spotify and Clear Channel’s iheartradio, and video via deals with streaming sites such as Netflix (though not yet in the U.S.) and Dailymotion. Some of the new apps are available immediately. The Timeline layout has started its beta test, and will be available to everyone in the coming weeks. Apart from the functional and visual changes Facebook revealed Thursday, the quality and style of the keynote speech also showed how the social network has grown as a company. The slides projected off of Zuckerberg’s laptop could have been taken directly from former Apple CEO Steve Jobs’ computer. Facebook also broke up its presentation with highly produced, evocative videos showing off exactly how they want users to take advantage of the new features. The moves are sure to irk some users and privacy advocates, who are likely to object to the real-time feeds from apps. If you hook up your accounts on other media sites to the network, you’ll have to come to terms with the fact that you may be sharing more than you realize.

Question: suppose the isotope is more unstable happens, how will it affect MORE vegetables.  How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer is:","output":"The question asks about the effects of an unstable isotope on the growth of more vegetables, specifically in relation to the second effect mentioned in the process of planting seeds. To answer this question, we need to first understand the potential impact of an unstable isotope on the growth of vegetables and how it could influence the second effect mentioned, which is picking a spot to plant the seeds. Unstable isotopes are radioactive elements that decay over time, releasing radiation in the form of particles or electromagnetic waves. If these isotopes are present in the soil or water where vegetables are being grown, they can potentially be absorbed by the plants. This radioactive contamination may lead to a variety of undesired consequences such as inhibited growth, DNA damage, or direct harm to the consumer of the vegetables. Now, let us consider how the presence of unstable isotopes could impact the second effect mentioned in the process of planting seeds, which is picking a spot to plant them. Ideally, one would want to select a location that is safe and suitable for the healthy growth of the vegetables. The presence of unstable isotopes might cause a decrease in the available options, as certain areas may become contaminated and unsuitable for planting. This could, in turn, lead to a reduction in the total number of vegetables that can be grown within a given area. Given this information, the presence of an unstable isotope would have a negative effect on the growth of more vegetables and influence the second effect mentioned – picking a spot to plant seeds – by making it more difficult or risky to select a proper location. This could ultimately lead to a decrease in the overall production of vegetables due to the radioactivity and contamination concerns caused by the unstable isotope. Therefore, the answer to the question is \\"less,\\" as the supposed perturbation caused by unstable isotopes would lead to a decrease in the total number of vegetables that can be grown and negatively impact the process of selecting the appropriate planting spot."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Believes dieters often fail because they don't acknowledge these benefits. Admitting why you WANT to be fat might help lose weight.","output":"Title: The Surprising Benefits of Being Overweight: How Acknowledging Them Can Help You Lose Weight Introduction: As society frequently advocates for a slender body image, the idea that there might be benefits to being overweight is counterintuitive. However, Dr. Bernadette Rock, an expert in the field, believes that understanding these benefits might actually be the key to a successful weight loss journey. This article explores the concept of acknowledging the perks that come with being fat to ultimately reach your weight loss goals. The Benefits of Being Overweight: Dr. Bernadette Rock asserts that being fat has certain advantages that are often overlooked. Here, we discuss some of these benefits, as recognized by the expert. 1. Protection: Carrying extra weight around serves as a protective body shield against physical harm. For some individuals, their excess weight might make them feel safer or more robust. 2. Reserve energy: People with additional body fat have extra reserves of energy that they can utilize during times of illness or nutrient shortages, allowing their bodies to cope better. 3. Emotional comfort: Food can often provide emotional satisfaction, and being overweight might be more comforting in times of distress, allowing for a sense of security. The Role of Acknowledging the Benefits: According to Dr. Bernadette Rock, acknowledging these benefits might be the key factor in successful weight loss because being aware of the reasons why you want to remain overweight can make it easier to tackle these issues head-on. Dieters, who frequently fail, often neglect to consider these advantages, making it more difficult for themselves to stay on track and ultimately lose weight. 1. Gain a healthier mindset: By acknowledging the benefits of being overweight, you can create a healthier mindset that's focused on optimizing your overall well-being rather than fixating on a particular body image. 2. Identify hidden motivations: Recognizing the reasons that make being overweight appealing to you can help you identify the underlying emotional needs. Addressing these needs in a constructive manner will enable a more effective weight loss journey. 3. Set realistic expectations: By accepting the benefits of being overweight, you are better equipped to establish attainable weight loss goals. This helps to prevent the collapse of motivation caused by unattainable expectations. Conclusion: Dr. Bernadette Rock's thought-provoking insight shifts our perspective on how to approach weight loss effectively. By acknowledging the advantages of being overweight, we can identify our hidden motivations, gain a healthier mindset, and set realistic goals for ourselves. Ultimately, this awareness can lead to a more successful and sustainable weight loss journey."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\". President Truman, symbolizing a broad-based desire for an Eisenhower candidacy for president, again in 1951 pressed him to run for the office as a Democrat. It was at this time that Eisenhower voiced his disagreements with the Democratic party and declared himself and his family to be Republicans. A \\"Draft Eisenhower\\" movement in the Republican Party persuaded him to declare his candidacy in the 1952 presidential election to counter the candidacy of non-interventionist Senator Robert A. Taft. The effort was a long struggle; Eisenhower had to be convinced that political circumstances had created a genuine duty for him to offer himself as a candidate, and that there was a mandate from the populace for him to be their President. Henry Cabot Lodge, who served as his campaign manager, and others succeeded in convincing him, and in June 1952 he resigned his command at NATO to campaign full-time. Eisenhower defeated Taft for the nomination, having won critical delegate votes from Texas. Eisenhower's campaign was noted for the simple but effective slogan, \\"I Like Ike\\". It was essential to his success that Eisenhower express opposition to Roosevelt's policy at Yalta and against Truman's policies in Korea and China—matters in which he had once participated.

Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: One of the challenges that every community faces, particularly teams inside a larger community, is the ability to coordinate what goals and ambitions the team is going to work on. Traditionally this has always been somewhat ad-hoc: people join a team and work on whatever they feel like. Ideas are ten-a-penny though. For most teams that work on larger projects (such as events, software, products and more) to actually be productive, coordinating this work can be complex: some projects require coordination across many people with different skill-sets, time-availability and resources. Something I would like us to work towards in the Ubuntu community is encouraging a culture of best-practise in how we plan our work and coordinate our awesome teams to work together on projects. I believe this kind of coordination can help our teams increase the opportunity for success in their work, feel more empowered and productive and provide greater insight to people outside those teams on what the team is doing. An effective way of doing this is to build a Roadmap for each cycle. This provides an opportunity to capture a set of goals the team will work together to achieve in each six-month period. This article outlines how to build such a Roadmap. While at first a roadmap can feel a little like a nod to the gods of bureaucracy, they actually possess many benefits: * Direction – one of the biggest complaints teams often report is a lack of direction. If a team gets into the habit of creating a roadmap at the beginning of a cycle, it gives the team a sense of focus and direction for the coming cycle. * Documented commitments are more effective – a common rule in Project Management training is that actions assigned to people in a shared document are more effective than ad-hoc or private commitments. By documenting who will work on what in a cycle and putting their name next to an action can help seal a sense of accountability for their contributions to the project. * Feeling of success – regularly revisiting a roadmap and...

Movie title: Bordertown Movie plot: The opening titles explain that American corporations are using the North American Free Trade Agreement by opening large maquiladoras right across the United StatesâMexico border. The maquiladoras hire mostly Mexican women to work long hours for little money in order to produce mass quantity products. Lauren Adrian (Jennifer Lopez), an impassioned American news reporter for the \\"Chicago Sentinel\\" wants to be assigned to the Iraq front-lines to cover the war. Instead, her editor George Morgan (Martin Sheen) assigns her to investigate a series of slayings involving young maquiladora factory women in a Mexican bordertown. Worker Eva (Maya Zapata), originally from the southern Mexican state of Oaxaca, takes a bus to go back to her shanty-town home after work. After a while she is the last passenger still in the bus. The driver asks her if she minds if he goes to a gas station to fill up, and Eva agrees. However, he takes her to a remote place and assaults and rapes her, together with another man, who then tries to strangle her. The two men, believing she's dead, bury her alive. With the little energy she has left, Eva escapes. Adrian heads to Ciudad JuÃ¡rez, Chihuahua, on the U.S.âMexico border to investigate the murders, hoping that if she does well she will be promoted by Morgan to be a foreign correspondent. In JuÃ¡rez, Adrian meets up with Diaz (Antonio Banderas), whom she had been working with six years before, and who is now the editor for the local newspaper \\"El Sol de JuÃ¡rez\\". She also meets Eva. The three try to find the two killers and have them prosecuted. For this purpose she starts working in the factory, in order to act as bait on the bus ride. The driver tries to assault her in the same way he did Eva, and although police assistance has been arranged, they are at the wrong place. She manages to escape her attacker.

Spacey was born in South Orange, New Jersey, to Kathleen Ann (nee Knutson), a secretary, and Thomas Geoffrey Fowler, a technical writer and data consultant. He has an older brother, Randy Fowler, who is a limo driver and Rod Stewart impersonator in Boise, Idaho, and a sister, Julie Ann Fowler Keir, an office worker. His family relocated to Southern California when Spacey was four years old. Randy Fowler (from whom Spacey is estranged) has stated that their father, whom he described as a racist \\"Nazi supporter\\", was sexually and physically abusive, and that Spacey had shut down emotionally and become \\"very sly and smart\\" to avoid whippings. Spacey's first professional stage appearance was as a spear carrier in a New York Shakespeare Festival performance of Henry VI, Part 1 in 1981. The following year, he made his first Broadway appearance, as Oswald in a production of Henrik Ibsen's Ghosts, starring Liv Ullmann. Then he portrayed Philinte in Moliere's The Misanthrope. In 1984, he appeared in a production of David Rabe's Hurlyburly, in which he rotated through each of the male parts (he would later play Mickey in the film version). Next came Anton Chekhov's The Seagull. In 1986, he appeared in a production of Sleuth in a New Jersey dinner theatre.  His prominence as a stage actor began in 1986, when he was cast opposite Jack Lemmon, Peter Gallagher and Bethel Leslie as Jamie, the eldest Tyrone son, in Jonathan Miller's lauded production of Eugene O'Neill's Long Day's Journey into Night. Lemmon in particular would become a mentor to him and was invited, along with Spacey's high school drama teacher, to be present when Spacey received his star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1999. He made his first major television appearance in the second-season premiere of Crime Story, playing a Kennedy-esque American senator. Although his interest soon turned to film, Spacey remained actively involved in the live theater community. In 1991, he won a Tony Award for his portrayal of Uncle Louie in Neil Simon's Broadway hit Lost in Yonkers. Spacey's father was unconvinced that Spacey could make a career for himself as an actor, and did not change his mind until Spacey became well-known.  Some of Spacey's early roles include a widowed eccentric millionaire on L.A. Law, the television miniseries The Murder of Mary Phagan (1988), opposite Lemmon, and the comedy See No Evil, Hear No Evil (1989). He earned a fan base after playing the criminally insane arms dealer Mel Profitt on the television series Wiseguy. He quickly developed a reputation as a character actor, and was cast in bigger roles, including one-half of a bickering Connecticut couple in the dark comedy film The Ref (1994), a malicious Hollywood studio boss in the satire Swimming with Sharks, and the malevolent office manager in the ensemble film Glengarry Glen Ross (1992), gaining him positive notices by critics. His performance as the enigmatic criminal Verbal Kint in 1995's The Usual Suspects won him the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor.  Spacey appeared in the 1995 thriller film Seven, making a sudden entrance late in the film as the serial killer John Doe after going unmentioned in the film's advertisements and opening credits. His work in Seven, The Usual Suspects and Outbreak earned him Best Supporting Actor honors at the 1995 Society of Texas Film Critics Awards. He remarked in 2013: \\"I think people just like me evil for some reason. They want me to be a son of a bitch.\\" Spacey played an egomaniacal district attorney in A Time to Kill (1996), and founded Trigger Street Productions in 1997, with the purpose of producing and developing entertainment across various media. He made his directorial debut with the film Albino Alligator (1996). The film was a failure at the box office, grossing 339,379 with a budget of 6 million, but critics praised Spacey's direction. He also voiced Hopper in the animated film A Bug's Life (1998).Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Did anything significant happen in 1999?","output":"In 1999, Kevin Spacey received his star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person whose father settled in London with his wife?  Giovanni Battista Barbirolli was born in Southampton Row, Holborn, London, the second child and eldest son of an Italian father and a French mother. He was a British national from birth, and as Southampton Row is within the sound of Bow Bells, Barbirolli always regarded himself as a Cockney. His father, Lorenzo Barbirolli (1864–1929), was a Venetian violinist who had settled in London with his wife, Louise Marie, née Ribeyrol (1870–1962). Lorenzo and his father had played in the orchestra at La Scala, Milan, where they had taken part in the première of Otello in 1887. In London they played in West End theatre orchestras, principally that of the Empire, Leicester Square. The young Barbirolli began to play the violin when he was four, but soon changed to the cello. He later said that this was at the instigation of his grandfather who, exasperated at the child's habit of wandering around while practising the violin, bought him a small cello to stop him from \\"getting in everybody's way\\". His education at St. Clement Danes Grammar School overlapped, from 1910, with a scholarship at Trinity College of Music. As a Trinity student, he made his concert debut in a cello concerto in the Queen's Hall in 1911. The following year he won a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Music, which he attended from 1912 to 1916, studying harmony, counterpoint and theory under Dr. J. B. McEwen and the cello with Herbert Walenn. In 1914 he was joint winner of the academy's Charles Rube Prize for ensemble playing, and in 1916 The Musical Times singled him out as \\"that excellent young 'cello player, Mr Giovanni Barbirolli.\\" The principal of the Academy, Sir Alexander Mackenzie, had forbidden students to play the chamber music of Ravel, which he regarded as \\"a pernicious influence\\". Barbirolli was keenly interested in modern music, and he and three colleagues secretly rehearsed Ravel's String Quartet in the privacy of a men's lavatory in the Academy.From 1916 to 1918 Barbirolli was a freelance cellist in London.

One such scientist, Dylan, suddenly begins to become manipulated by an invisible force, which creates a scene to the guests and drags the scientist into the nearby bathroom and proceeds to brutally beat and throw Dylan around the room. Dylan apparently knows who it is, and begs the invisible man not to kill him, as he \\"doesn't have it\\", but the invisible man persists as he's \\"getting worse\\" and he's \\"running out of time\\". Though he does not know how to make more, Dylan mentions that another scientist, Maggie Dalton (Laura Regan), knows the formula. Seemingly accepting this, the invisible man releases Dylan and tells him not to tell anyone he was here, to which he agrees. No sooner has he left, than Dylan attempts to call someone on his cell phone, but the invisible man, who only pretended to leave to see if Dylan would stay silent, smashes the phone on the ground, and slashes Dylan's neck with the broken circuit board, killing him.The police arrive at the laboratory to conduct an investigation, but the military supervisor of the laboratory, Colonel Gavin Bishop (William MacDonald), insists it is an internal military situation and the police have no jurisdiction over the crime, and refuses to relent even when one of the detectives, Frank Turner (Peter Facinelli), points out that they have no experience conducting a proper criminal investigation.Fearing another attack on the remaining scientists, the lab company owner, Dr. William Reisner (David McIlwraith), employs Turner and his partner, Detective Lisa Martinez (Sarah Deakins), to protect Maggie (despite the military forcing the police out of the investigation), but refuses to divulge any information to the detectives on the nature of the work they are doing, which includes refusing to tell them that an invisible killer is on the loose.Turner and Lisa, after gaining Maggie's reluctant cooperation,...

Cette situation a suscité de nombreuses controverses et a fait l'objet de critiques tant au niveau national qu'international, principalement en raison de l'âge d'Omar Khadr au moment de son arrestation et de son incarcération dans des conditions considérées comme inhumaines et dégradantes. En effet, le traitement réservé à Omar Khadr soulève des questions importantes concernant le respect des droits de l'homme et du droit international, notamment le droit des enfants à être protégés contre toute forme de violence et de sévices. La Convention relative aux droits de l'enfant, ratifiée par les États-Unis et le Canada, interdit ainsi l'utilisation des enfants pour des activités militaires et impose aux États l'obligation de prendre toutes les mesures nécessaires pour assurer leur bien-être et leur réhabilitation. Dans le cas d'Omar Khadr, plusieurs organisations de défense des droits de l'homme et de protection de l'enfance ont dénoncé les violations présumées du droit international et ont appelé les autorités canadiennes et américaines à mettre fin à son incarcération et à lui fournir une assistance juridique et psychologique adaptée. Toutefois, le gouvernement canadien a persisté à ne pas intervenir dans ce dossier qui impliquait un de ses ressortissants, laissant ainsi peser de lourds soupçons sur sa volonté de défendre véritablement les droits et les intérêts de ses citoyens dans l'arène internationale.

November 11] 1890 – December 30, 1941), known as El Lissitzky (Russian: Эль Лиси́цкий, Yiddish: על ליסיצקי‎), was a Russian artist, designer, photographer, typographer, polemicist and architect. He was an important figure of the Russian avant-garde, helping develop suprematism with his mentor, Kazimir Malevich, and designing numerous exhibition displays and propaganda works for the Soviet Union. His work greatly influenced the Bauhaus and constructivist movements, and he experimented with production techniques and stylistic devices that would go on to dominate 20th-century graphic design.Lissitzky's entire career was laced with the belief that the artist could be an agent for change, later summarized with his edict, \\"das zielbewußte Schaffen\\" (goal-oriented creation). Lissitzky, of Lithuanian Jewish оrigin, began his career illustrating Yiddish children's books in an effort to promote Jewish culture in Russia. When only 15 he started teaching, a duty he would maintain for most of his life. Over the years, he taught in a variety of positions, schools, and artistic media, spreading and exchanging ideas. He took this ethic with him when he worked with Malevich in heading the suprematist art group UNOVIS, when he developed a variant suprematist series of his own, Proun, and further still in 1921, when he took up a job as the Russian cultural ambassador to Weimar Germany, working with and influencing important figures of the Bauhaus and De Stijl movements during his stay. In his remaining years he brought significant innovation and change to typography, exhibition design, photomontage, and book design, producing critically respected works and winning international acclaim for his exhibition design. This continued until his deathbed, where in 1941 he produced one of his last works – a Soviet propaganda poster rallying the people to construct more tanks for the fight against Nazi Germany.

What are alternatives to the electoral college in the U.S.? What are some alternatives to the electoral college? Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","output":"Yes, these two questions are paraphrases of each other, as they both inquire about the possible alternatives to the electoral college in the United States. They aim to gather information on different methods to elect the country's president instead of relying on the electoral college system presently in place. Alternatives to the Electoral College: 1. Direct Popular Vote: This method would abolish the electoral college and elect the president based on the total number of individual votes (popular vote) received by each candidate across the nation. With a direct popular vote, every person's vote would carry equal weight, and whoever receives the most votes would become the president. This could potentially encourage candidates to campaign more broadly and not just focus on swing states. 2. National Bonus Plan: Proposed by Senator Malcolm Moos in 1950, this system would maintain the electoral college while adding a predetermined number of bonus electoral votes (for example, 102) to the candidate who wins the national popular vote. This would give weight to the popular vote while still retaining some aspects of the current electoral college system. 3. Proportional Allocation of Electoral Votes: Instead of the current winner-take-all approach in most states, electoral votes would be allocated proportionally based on the percentage of the popular vote won by each candidate. This would prevent situations where a candidate wins the state by a slim margin but takes all the electoral votes, ensuring a more equitable distribution. 4. Congressional District Plan: Adopted by Maine and Nebraska, this approach allocates electoral votes based on the outcomes of individual congressional districts. The winner in each district would receive one electoral vote, and the remaining two votes (representing the state's senators) would go to the candidate with the most overall votes in the state. This method provides a more localized representation of the voters' preferences, thus balancing urban and rural interests. 5. Ranked-choice Voting: Voters would rank candidates in order of preference, and if no candidate receives a majority of first-choice votes, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated. The votes of the eliminated candidate would then be redistributed to the remaining candidates based on voters' second-choice preferences. This process would continue until a candidate reaches a majority. Ranked-choice voting could lead to a more consensus-driven election result and the possibility of third-party candidates gaining traction. 6. Approval Voting: Voters would cast a vote for any number of candidates they approve of, rather than selecting only one. The candidate with the highest total approval votes wins the election. This method encourages voters to support their genuine preferences without fear that their vote would be \\"wasted\\" on a less popular candidate. It also has the potential to reduce negative campaigning and promote collaboration between candidates with similar platforms. 7. Instant Runoff Voting / Single Transferable Vote: Similar to ranked-choice voting, but in this system, if no candidate receives a majority, the remaining candidates become the new options for redistribution. This process continues until there is a clear winner with a majority of votes. It can lead to a more representative outcome of the electorate’s preferences and, like ranked-choice voting, can give third-party candidates more opportunities. Each of these alternatives has its pros and cons and requires substantial analysis and debate to determine the feasibility of adoption within the U.S. electoral framework. Nonetheless, these alternatives strive to provide a more equitable and representative electoral process that could better reflect the will of the American voters."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Context: In 1954, under the \\"Charter for the Kingdom of the Netherlands\\", the Netherlands, Suriname and the Netherlands Antilles  became a composite kingdom. The former colonies were granted autonomy, save for certain matters including defense, foreign affairs and citizenship, which were the responsibility of the Realm. In 1969, unrest in Curaçao led to Dutch marines being sent to quell rioting. In 1973, negotiations started in Suriname for independence, and full independence was granted in 1975, with 60,000 emigrants taking the opportunity of moving to the Netherlands. In 1986, Aruba was allowed to secede from the Netherlands Antilles federation, and was pressured by the Netherlands to move to independence within ten years. However, in 1994, it was agreed that its status as a Realm in its own right could continue. On October 10, 2010, the Netherlands Antilles were dissolved. Effective on that date, Curaçao and Sint Maarten acceded to the same country status within the Kingdom that Aruba already enjoyed. The islands of Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba were granted a status similar to Dutch municipalities, and are now sometimes referred to as the Caribbean Netherlands. Question: How many years was it between Suriname's independence and the date the Netherlands Antilles were dissolved? Answer:","output":"To determine the number of years between Suriname's independence and the date the Netherlands Antilles were dissolved, we need to look at the years mentioned in the context. Suriname gained full independence in 1975. The Netherlands Antilles were dissolved on October 10, 2010. Now, we need to calculate the difference between the years. 2010 - 1975 = 35 years So, it was 35 years between Suriname's independence and the date the Netherlands Antilles were dissolved."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The estimate of tonnes of bombs an enemy could drop per day grew as aircraft technology advanced, from 75 in 1922, to 150 in 1934, to 644 in 1937. That year the Committee on Imperial Defence estimated that an attack of 60 days would result in 600,000 dead and 1,200,000 wounded. News reports of the Spanish Civil War, such as the bombing of Barcelona, supported the 50-casualties-per-tonne estimate. By 1938 experts generally expected that Germany would attempt to drop as much as 3,500 tonnes in the first 24 hours of war and average 700 tonnes a day for several weeks. In addition to high explosive and incendiary bombs the enemy would possibly use poison gas and even bacteriological warfare, all with a high degree of accuracy.

What is the answer for the question: What is the full name of the man that resupplied the depot that was reached on February 23rd by the group that aimed to reach Hut Point in 50 days? from the following article ?  The party turned for home after 73 days' southward travel. Rations had been cut several times to extend the return journey time beyond the original 110-day estimate. Shackleton now aimed to reach Hut Point in 50 days, since according to Shackleton's prior orders Nimrod, having returned to take the expedition home, would depart on 1 March at the latest. The four men were now much weakened, yet in the following days they achieved impressive distances, reaching the head of the glacier on 19 January. As they began the descent they had five days' food at half rations, to last them until the Lower Glacier depot; during the ascent the same distance had taken 12 days. Shackleton's physical condition was by now a major concern, yet according to Adams \\"the worse he felt, the harder he pulled\\".The depot was reached on 28 January. Wild, ill with dysentery, was unable to pull or to eat anything but biscuits, which were in short supply. On 31 January Shackleton forced his own breakfast biscuit on Wild, a gesture that moved Wild to write: \\"BY GOD I shall never forget. Thousands of pounds would not have bought that one biscuit\\". A few days later, the rest of the party were struck with severe enteritis, the result of eating tainted pony-meat. But the pace of march had to be maintained; the small amounts of food carried between depots would make any delay fatal. However, a strong wind behind them enabled them to set a sail on the sledge and maintain a good marching rate. \\"We are so thin that our bones ache as we lie on the hard snow\\", wrote Shackleton. From 18 February onward they began to pick up familiar landmarks, and on the 23rd they reached Bluff Depot, which to their great relief had been copiously resupplied by Ernest Joyce. The range of delicacies over and above the crates of regular supplies was listed by Shackleton: \\"Carlsbad plums, eggs, cakes, plum pudding, gingerbread and crystallised fruit\\". Wild's laconic comment was \\"Good old Joyce\\".Their food worries were now resolved, but they still had to get back to Hut...

DrumPants let wearers play music anywhere using wearable sensors that transform a pair of jeans into a drum kit or a shirt into a guitar. The easily concealed sensor sticks are attached to a control box that lets a person choose from more than 100 sounds - including instruments such as the piano. DrumPants claim to let wearers lay music anywhere using wearable sensors that can transform a pair of jeans into a drum kit or a shirt into a guitar. Users can also add their own noises, such as the meow of a cat as they are playing, too. DrumPants wearers have the option of listening to their musical endeavours using headphones or if they are more of a performer, they can broadcast their sounds using an external speaker that can be clipped onto their clothes. Two wearable strips, which are offered in the San Francisco-based firm’s basic DrumPants kit, contain six sensors, but extra strips can be added. The sensor sticks, which are very thin and. flexible and respond to touch, can be attached to any item of clothing. with ‘ultra-thin Velcro stickies’. Users of DrumPants can listen to their musical endeavours using headphones or if they are more of a performer, broadcast their music using an external speaker that can be clipped onto their clothes. ‘Just stick them inside your clothes and easily swap the drum pad strips between outfits,’ the company said.

Write highlights for this article: A 27-year-old man with a history of mental illness was detained after he jumped a fence at Tampa International Airport Monday evening and ran onto an active runway. The man, who was not hurt, was given a trespass warning and taken to a hospital for a mental evaluation, airport spokeswoman Janet Zink told CNN. The man was apprehended within three minutes after he crossed the fence, Zink said. Zink said the man jumped a fence shortly after 5 p.m. and ran toward Runway 1 Right. He was observed by an employee of an airplane maintenance company, who called 911, she said. Air traffic controllers, pilots and airport police were recorded talking about the event on LiveATC.net tapes. \\"How about the guy over here walking on the runway,\\" one pilot said. \\"I have no knowledge of that, but I think I see something now,\\" the controller responds, before instructing a Southwest flight taxiing to the runway to stop. \\"He's got his arms up ... he's walking northbound on the runway.\\" A police officer then asks for clearance to enter the runway to apprehend the man. \\"That's something you don't see every day, tower,\\" another pilot radioed. \\"No you don't,\\" the controller responded. The incident briefly delayed a Southwest flight from Tampa to Houston, and a United flight from Tampa to Chicago. CNN Producer Brian Rokus contributed to this report. Highlights:","output":"1.

To install the siding, we didn't need the hammer, but required the drill, as the part of the job that needed the","output":"hammer had already been completed. We proceeded with the following steps: Step 1: Gather materials Before beginning, we made sure we had all the necessary materials, including the siding panels, drill, drill bits, screws, a level, a measuring tape, a utility knife, and safety goggles. We also prepared a sturdy ladder to reach the higher parts of the house. Step 2: Measure and mark Next, we measured and marked the exact locations on the wall where the siding panels would be placed. To ensure proper alignment, we used a level, string line, or chalk line, depending on the surface, for straight and accurate lines. Moreover, we took into account appropriate spacing for expansion and contraction of the siding material due to temperature changes. Step 3: Cutting the siding panels We then carefully measured and cut the siding panels to size using the utility knife. In some cases, we needed to use a circular saw, with the appropriate blade, for more precise cuts or for dealing with more rigid materials. Step 4: Installing the starter strip Starting at the bottom of the exterior wall, we secured a starter strip that would serve as a base for the first row of siding. We ensured that it was leveled before attaching it with screws, making sure not to overtighten them. Step 5: Attaching the siding panels Following the manufacturer's instructions, we placed the first siding panel onto the starter strip, making sure it was level and properly aligned. We then drilled pilot holes and attached the siding panel using screws. We continued attaching each panel, overlapping them as needed and ensuring that they were in line with the previously installed siding. Step 6: Cutting around windows, doors, and other obstacles For any locations where siding needed to be fitted around windows, doors, or other architectural features, we measured and cut the siding panels accordingly, ensuring a snug fit. If needed, we used a jigsaw or a hole saw for more intricate cuts. Step 7: Installing trim and finishing touches After all the siding panels were securely attached, we moved on to install the trim around doors, windows, corners, and any other edges where a finished look was required. We measured and cut the trim to fit each location, attaching it using screws and the drill. Step 8: Final inspection and cleanup Lastly, we conducted a thorough inspection to verify that all siding panels were properly installed. We checked for any loose panels or trim pieces and made the necessary adjustments. Then, we cleaned up the work area, disposing of any leftover material and debris. By following these systematic steps, we were able to successfully complete the siding installation process without needing a hammer. The use of the drill made for a more efficient and precise job, ensuring a longer-lasting and visually appealing finish."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

No. The two questions are fundamentally different in their focus and the issues they seek to address.  The first question, \\"If there are ants on your food do you leave it or eat it regardless?\\" is concerned with individual preferences and decision-making in a specific situation. This question is asking whether, in a scenario where ants are present on one's food, a person would choose to discard the food or consume it despite the ants' presence. This inquiry aims to gauge personal opinions and reactions to a potential real-life scenario that involves a level of disgust or health concerns.  In contrast, the second question, \\"Why are people still eating McDonald's food?\\" addresses societal norms, consumer preferences, and potentially the health implications of fast food consumption. It asks why, despite the numerous concerns regarding the nutritional value and quality of fast food (in this case, McDonald's), people continue to patronize and consume such products. This inquiry considers broader concepts such as taste, convenience, affordability, and marketing strategies that might influence consumer choices. In summary, while both questions might touch upon aspects of eating and food decision-making, they are not the same.

They return to Texas to start their life together on the family ranch, Reata, where Bick's older sister Luz runs the household. Leslie meets Jett Rink, a local handyman, and he becomes infatuated with her. Leslie discovers on a ride with Jett that the local Mexican workers' living conditions are terrible. After tending to one of the Mexican children, Angel Obregon II, she presses Bick to take steps to improve their condition. When riding Leslie's beloved horse, War Winds, Luz expresses her hostility for Leslie by cruelly digging in her spurs; War Winds bucks her off, killing her. She leaves Jett a small piece of land on the Benedict ranch. Bick, who despises Jett, tries to buy back the land, but Jett refuses to sell. Jett makes the land his home and names it Little Reata. Over the next ten years, Leslie and Bick have twins, Jordan II (\\"Jordy\\") and Judy, and later have a daughter, Luz II.

Q:I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What college did Lancaster attend between school and university? ?  At the age of seventeen Lancaster passed his final school examinations and gained entrance to Lincoln College, Oxford, to study history. He persuaded his mother to allow him to leave Charterhouse at once, giving him several months between school and university, during which he enrolled on a course of life classes at the Byam Shaw School of Art in London. In October 1926 he started at Oxford. There, as at Charterhouse, he found two camps in which some students chose to group themselves: the \\"hearties\\" presented themselves as aggressively heterosexual and anti-intellectual; the \\"aesthetes\\" had a largely homosexual membership. Lancaster followed his elder contemporary Kenneth Clark in being contentedly heterosexual but nonetheless one of the aesthetes, and he was accepted as a leading member of their set. He cultivated the image of an Edwardian dandy, with large moustache, a monocle and check suits, modelling his persona to a considerable degree on Beerbohm, whom he admired greatly. He also absorbed some characteristics of the Oxford don Maurice Bowra; Lancaster's friend James Lees-Milne commented, \\"Bowra's influence over Osbert was marked, to the extent that he adopted the guru's booming voice, explosive emphasis of certain words and phrases, and habit in conversation of regaling his audiences with rehearsed witticisms and gossip.\\" Lancaster's undergraduate set included Stephen Spender, Randolph Churchill, and most importantly John Betjeman, who became a close friend and lifelong influence.Lancaster tried rowing with the Oxford University Boat Club, but quickly discovered that he was no more suited to that than he had been to field games at school. He joined the Oxford University Dramatic Society (OUDS), acted in supporting roles, designed programme covers, wrote, and choreographed. He contributed prose and drawings to Isis and Cherwell magazines, engaged in student pranks, staged an exhibition of his pictures, attended life classes, and became established as a major figure in the Oxonian social scene.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who opened the camp that used the ticketing section of the old railroad depot for its main lodge?  The bank building was bought in 1944 by D. L. King of Rogers, who remodeled it and made it home to his Atlas Manufacturing Company which produced poultry equipment. However, King moved the business back to Rogers the next year. The building then stood idle, becoming victim to vandalism. All of its windows were smashed and it became covered in graffiti. Eventually, it was nothing more than an empty, roofless, concrete shell.In 1944, both Missouri and Oklahoma Row were sold to Springdale businessmen Roy Joyce and Jim Barrack. Missouri Row was torn down and sold in small lots. The roof tiles were bought by a Little Rock law firm. By 1956, the building had collapsed, leaving only a small section standing.Oklahoma Row continued to provide lodging, although it was run and managed by several different people. In June 1946, Company G of the Arkansas State Guard held camp at Monte Ne for field training, using the hotel facilities. Access to Monte Ne improved a bit in August 1947 when the state highway department blacktopped 1.4 miles (2.25 km) of the Monte Ne road. In January, six Monte Ne men were arrested for grand larceny, charged with stealing doors from Oklahoma Row and 500 feet (152 m) of pipe from the swimming pool. A resident of the area, Iris Armstrong opened up a girls' camp just east of the amphitheater in 1922. She named it Camp Joyzelle, after the Maurice Maeterlinck play of the same name. The camp made use of the amphitheater for plays and its cabins, named after Greek goddesses, dotted the hillside. Oklahoma Row was used in 1945 for lodging people who had come to visit the campers. It was used for this purpose up until 1962 as well as for social events and activities such as plays and campfire ceremonies. The camp also used the ticketing section of the old railroad depot for its main lodge and crafts building. In 1955 Dallas Barrack, a Springdale antique dealer, bought Oklahoma Row, and renovated it into an antique store called the Palace Art Galleries.

Input: Cdk5 is a member of the cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) family, which is activated by neuronal activators p35 or p39. Cdk5 regulates a variety of neuronal activities including migration, synaptic activity and neuronal death. p35 and p39 impart cytoplasmic membrane association of p35-Cdk5 and p39-Cdk5, respectively, through their myristoylation, but it is not clearly understood how the cellular localization is related to different functions. We investigated the role of Cdk5 activity in the subcellular localization of p35-Cdk5 and p39-Cdk5. Cdk5 activity affected the localization of p35-Cdk5 and p39-Cdk5 through phosphorylation of p35 or p39. Using unphosphorylated or phosphomimetic mutants of p35 and p39, we found that phosphorylation at Ser8, common to p35 and p39, by Cdk5 regulated the cytoplasmic localization and perinuclear accumulation of unphosphorylated S8A mutants, and whole cytoplasmic distribution of phosphomimetic S8E mutants. Cdk5 activity was necessary to retain Cdk5-activator complexes in the cytoplasm. Nevertheless, small but distinct amounts of p35 and p39 were detected in the nucleus. In particular, nuclear p35 and p39 were increased when the Cdk5 activity was inhibited. p39 had a greater propensity to accumulate in the nucleus than p35, and phosphorylation at Thr84, specific to p39, regulated the potential nuclear localization activity of the Lys cluster in p39. These results suggest that the subcellular localization of the Cdk5-activator complexes is determined by its kinase activity, and also implicate a role for p39-Cdk5 in the nucleus.

Summarize this article: The woman who alleged Prime Minister Justin Trudeau touched her inappropriately some two decades ago issued a statement Friday saying the incident happened as described — but she now wants to be left alone.      \\"I issue this statement reluctantly, in response to mounting media pressure to confirm that I was the reporter who was the subject of the Open Eyes editorial, published in the Creston Valley Advance in August of 2000,\\" Rose Knight, the former journalist, wrote.      \\"The incident referred to in the editorial did occur, as reported. Mr. Trudeau did apologize the next day. I did not pursue the incident at the time and will not be pursuing the incident further. I have had no subsequent contact with Mr. Trudeau, before or after he became Prime Minister.\\"      Knight, who said she has since left journalism, added she will not speak any further about the incident.      \\"The debate, if it continues, will continue without my involvement,\\" she said.      Trudeau was asked about Knight's statement while in Calgary for an investment announcement.      \\"Over the past weeks, since this news resurfaced, I've been reflecting, we've all been reflecting, on past behaviours,\\" he said. \\"And as I've said, I'm confident I didn't act inappropriately, but I think the essence of this is people can experience interactions differently and part of the lesson we need to learn in this moment of collective awakening ... people in many cases, women, experience interactions in professional contexts and other contexts differently than men.      Prime Minister Justin Trudeau spoke to reporters in Calgary on Friday 5:12      \\"I apologized in the moment because I had obviously perceived that she had experienced it in a different way than I acted or I experienced it.\\"      The incident is alleged to have taken place in 2000 — when Trudeau was 28 — at the Kokanee Summit in Creston, B.C. The event was raising money for the Avalanche Foundation, a charity Trudeau became involved with after his brother, Michel, died in an avalanche in 1998.      An unsigned editorial appeared in the Creston Valley Advance after the event accusing Trudeau of \\"groping\\" and \\"inappropriately handling\\" a young female reporter while she was on assignment. It suggests the woman felt \\"blatantly disrespected\\" but provides no other details about what occurred.      The editorial in the Creston Valley Advance suggested that the day after the incident, Trudeau offered an apology of sorts: \\"I'm sorry,\\" he is quoted as saying. \\"If I had known you were reporting for a national paper I never would have been so forward.\\"      The prime minister addressed that apology in detail on Thursday.      \\"Again, I've been reflecting on the actual interaction and if I apologized later, then it would be because I sensed that she was not entirely comfortable with the interaction that we had,\\" Trudeau said.      The allegations date back to a B.C. festival in August 2000 — an editorial accused Trudeau of \\"groping\\" and \\"inappropriately handling\\" an unnamed young female reporter. 2:29      \\"Like I said, I've been working very hard to try and piece it together, and even when the original editorial came out at the time I was fairly confident, I was very confident, that I hadn't acted in a way that I felt was in any way inappropriate.\\"      Earlier this year, CBC News communicated by phone and email with Knight. She said she was not interested in being associated with any further coverage of the story. She also asked that her name not be used and that she not be contacted about the story again.      A former co-worker remembers the reporter's account of the encounter. Valerie Bourne was the publisher of the Creston Valley Advance at the time and said the reporter was \\"distressed\\" by her contact with Trudeau.      \\"My recollections of the conversation were that she came to me because she was unsettled by it. She didn't like what had happened,\\" said Bourne. \\"She wasn't sure how she should proceed with it because, of course, we're talking somebody who was known to the Canadian community.\\"      Trudeau is expected to attend an event Saturday with Calgary MP Kent Hehr, who lost his cabinet post after an investigation into allegations of inappropriate conduct with women.

Avoid answers that are incorrect or provides incomplete justification for the question. Q: Passage: Time is one of the seven fundamental physical quantities in both the International System of Units and International System of Quantities. Time is used to define other quantities—such as velocity—so defining time in terms of such quantities would result in circularity of definition. An operational definition of time, wherein one says that observing a certain number of repetitions of one or another standard cyclical event (such as the passage of a free-swinging pendulum) constitutes one standard unit such as the second, is highly useful in the conduct of both advanced experiments and everyday affairs of life. The operational definition leaves aside the question whether there is something called time, apart from the counting activity just mentioned, that flows and that can be measured. Investigations of a single continuum called spacetime bring questions about space into questions about time, questions that have their roots in the works of early students of natural philosophy.

Jules Émile Frédéric Massenet (French: [ʒyl emil fʁedeʁik masnɛ]; 12 May 1842 – 13 August 1912) was a French composer of the Romantic era best known for his operas, of which he wrote more than thirty. The two most frequently staged are Manon (1884) and Werther (1892). He also composed oratorios, ballets, orchestral works, incidental music, piano pieces, songs and other music. While still a schoolboy, Massenet was admitted to France's principal music college, the Paris Conservatoire. There he studied under Ambroise Thomas, whom he greatly admired. After winning the country's top musical prize, the Prix de Rome, in 1863, he composed prolifically in many genres, but quickly became best known for his operas. Between 1867 and his death forty-five years later he wrote more than forty stage works in a wide variety of styles, from opéra-comique to grand-scale depictions of classical myths, romantic comedies, lyric dramas, as well as oratorios, cantatas and ballets. Massenet had a good sense of the theatre and of what would succeed with the Parisian public. Despite some miscalculations, he produced a series of successes that made him the leading composer of opera in France in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Like many prominent French composers of the period, Massenet became a professor at the Conservatoire. He taught composition there from 1878 until 1896, when he resigned after the death of the director, Ambroise Thomas. Among his students were Gustave Charpentier, Ernest Chausson, Reynaldo Hahn and Gabriel Pierné. By the time of his death, Massenet was regarded by many critics as old-fashioned and unadventurous although his two best-known operas remained popular in France and abroad. After a few decades of neglect, his works began to be favourably reassessed during the mid-20th century, and many of them have since been staged and recorded. Although critics do not rank him among the handful of outstanding operatic geniuses such as Mozart, Verdi and Wagner, his operas are now widely accepted as well-crafted...

Law enforcement is scrambling to find the connection and put a stop to these acts of terror.  Enter Jack Miller, a recently retired, highly skilled explosives expert formerly with the NYPD Bomb Squad. Despite stepping away from his law enforcement career, his unmatched expertise forces the department to recruit him as a consultant while they are under pressure to prevent the next blast, with fear and anxiety gripping the entire city. As Miller works to investigate these bombings, he begins to notice a complex pattern between the targets which leads him to unearth a vast array of personal files and a hidden, encrypted diary that once belonged to a mysterious person who went by the code name \\"Phantom.\\" Miller teams up with a rookie detective, Angela Ramirez, and together they decode the diary revealing it to have belonged to a former rogue military explosives specialist who was involved in covert operations.  As they get closer to unveiling the true identity of the Phantom, the bombings become increasingly personal, with one bomb resulting in the tragic death of Miller's longtime friend and colleague. Now fueled by grief and vengeance, Miller and Ramirez work tirelessly to unveil the Phantom's network, unravel their plot, and bring them to justice. During a high-stakes race against time, Miller and Ramirez uncover that the Phantom, presumed to be dead, is actually alive and operating from the shadows with a new identity - Miller's former bomb squad partner and mentor, Tom Weston. Weston had secretly become disillusioned with his career and the government's agenda, turning into the cunning and ruthless mastermind behind the bombings.  In a thrilling climax, Miller uses his unmatched skill and knowledge to defuse the most potentially devastating bomb yet, set to destroy a major city landmark. After disarming the device, Miller confronts his former mentor in a heart-stopping face-off that reveals deep, hidden motivations behind Weston's actions.  After a pulse-pounding chase across the city, Miller apprehends Weston just as the police close in, saving New York City from a terrifying catastrophe. Having proved himself not just as an explosives expert, but as a true hero, Miller decides to permanently return to the force, working alongside Ramirez to continue protecting the city and chasing down evil. Countdown to Chaos is an action-packed, suspenseful rollercoaster ride that keeps you on the edge of your seat, giving audiences a thrilling glimpse into the life and mind of an explosives expert tasked with saving the city he loves."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In Romanian, the word \\"trebuie\\" expresses the necessity or obligation of something, and it can be understood as \\"must\\" or \\"have to\\" in English. \\"Văzut\\" is the past participle of \\"a vedea\\" which means \\"to see\\". The use of past participle here indicates that the action has to be completed. 2. \\"And I want it acknowledged\\" translates to \\"și îmi doresc să fie recunoscut\\". \\"Și\\" is the conjunction used to link words of the same part of speech, clauses, or sentences that are to be taken jointly, equivalent to \\"and\\". \\"Îmi doresc\\" means \\"I want\\", \\"să fie\\" translates to \\"to be\\", and \\"recunoscut\\" is the past participle of \\"a recunoaște\\", meaning \\"acknowledged\\" or \\"recognized\\". 3. \\"As a departure from European law and practice\\" becomes \\"drept o abatere de la legea și practica europeană\\". The word \\"drept\\" basically means \\"as\\", and can be used to introduce information. \\"O abatere\\" translates to \\"a departure\\", \\"de la\\" means \\"from\\", \\"legea și practica\\" is \\"law and practice\\", and \\"europeană\\" means \\"European\\".

Answer the following question: I heard that Carson broke their fall using the pillow but they still scraped their knee and it was bleeding.  And I was wondering What will Carson want to do next? Answer:","output":"Carson will likely want to follow a proper wound care procedure to ensure that their scraped knee heals effectively and to minimize the risk of infection. Here are the steps Carson should take: 1. Clean the wound: Carson should wash their hands with soap and water before touching the scraped knee. They should then gently clean the wound using water and a mild soap, or with an antiseptic solution or wipe to remove any dirt, debris, or germs. 2. Stop the bleeding: If the wound is still bleeding, Carson should apply gentle pressure with a clean cloth or sterile gauze for a few minutes, or until the bleeding stops. Elevating the injured area can also help to reduce blood flow to the area and minimize bleeding. 3. Apply an antibiotic ointment: Once the wound is clean and the bleeding has stopped, Carson should apply a thin layer of an over-the-counter antibiotic ointment to the scraped area to help prevent infection. 4. Cover the wound: Carson can then cover the scraped knee with a sterile bandage, adhesive bandage, or gauze pad, depending on the size and severity of the wound. This will help to keep the area clean and protected from further injury. 5. Monitor for signs of infection: Carson should keep an eye on the scraped knee for any signs of infection, such as redness, swelling, increased pain, or discharge. If any of these symptoms develop, they should consult a healthcare professional for further guidance. 6. Change the dressing: Carson should replace the wound dressing as needed, ideally at least once a day, or when it becomes wet or dirty. They should also keep the wound clean and dry to promote healing. 7. Avoid picking at the scab: It is essential that Carson refrains from picking at the scab that forms over the wound, as this can delay healing and increase the risk of infection or scarring.

Choose your answer: There is currently more work on coreference resolution than on chunking because it is a problem that is still far from being solved. Tell me who it is. Select from: (I) coreference resolution; (II) chunking;","output":"(I) coreference resolution Coreference resolution, the process of identifying and linking multiple mentions of the same entity in a text, is a problem that is still far from being solved. This has led to a surge in research in this area resulting in more work conducted on coreference resolution than chunking. Here are several reasons why coreference resolution remains a challenging field and continues to attract research efforts: 1. Ambiguity: Coreference resolution heavily relies on the understanding of context, syntax, and semantics to solve the inherent ambiguity present in the use of pronouns and other referring expressions in natural language. This demands sophisticated models that can deal with the complexities of real-world data. 2. Anaphora and Cataphora: Coreference resolution not only involves identifying anaphoric expressions (referring back to previously mentioned entities) but also cataphora (forward-looking references). Intertwining these two phenomena in a single model poses significant challenges. 3. Incomplete or missing information: In many cases, the information needed to resolve a reference is not explicitly mentioned in the text. This requires models to possess real-world knowledge and the ability to infer the missing pieces of information based on context. 4. Linguistic variations: The problem of coreference resolution spans across languages, each with its unique grammar rules, syntax, and dependencies. It necessitates cross-lingual approaches capable of handling diverse linguistic structures and challenges. 5. Scalability: Coreference resolution must be able to handle ever-increasing volumes of text data efficiently. Addressing this in large-scale applications continues to be an active area of research. 6. Evaluation: Evaluating the performance of coreference resolution systems in a reliable and standardized manner is a challenge in itself, primarily due to the complex nature of language and the lack of universally agreed-upon evaluation metrics and sample datasets. In contrast, chunking or shallow parsing (the task of identifying phrases in a text) is comparatively less complex and has seen significant advancements in recent years. Although the field continues to evolve, the overall progress has made the problem of chunking less critical in comparison to coreference resolution. Given the challenges and complexities mentioned above, coreference resolution has attracted more research and work efforts in comparison to chunking. A considerable breakthrough in coreference resolution would have wide-reaching implications in various natural language processing applications such as machine translation, sentiment analysis, information extraction, and question-answering systems, making it crucial for researchers to continue pursuing solutions to this challenging problem."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:What is the final step of the following process: -  Solar radiation reaches Earth's atmosphere - Some is reflected back into space - The rest of the energy is absorbed by land and oceans, heating the Earth - Heat radiates from Earth to space - Some of this heat is trapped by greenhouse gases in the atmosphere - Human activities such as burning fuel are increasing the amount of greenhouses gases - This causes more heat radiation to stay trapped in our atmosphere A:","output":"The final step of the process is the intensification of the greenhouse effect, leading to global warming and climate change.  When solar radiation reaches Earth's atmosphere, some of it is reflected back into space, while the rest is absorbed by the land and oceans, heating the Earth. The heat then radiates back towards space. However, some of that heat is trapped by greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), and fluorinated gases, which helps maintain Earth's temperature at a level suitable for life. Human activities, including burning fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas), deforestation, agriculture, and industrial processes, have significantly increased the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. The increase in these gases causes more heat radiation to be trapped within our atmosphere, enhancing the greenhouse effect. The result of the intensification of the greenhouse effect is global warming. This warming has observable consequences on the Earth's climate, including rising temperatures, more extreme weather events such as hurricanes and droughts, melting polar ice caps and glaciers, rising sea levels, and changes in ecosystems and wildlife. To address this issue, efforts are being made to reduce human-caused greenhouse gas emissions through various mitigation strategies like increasing energy efficiency, transitioning to cleaner energy sources (wind, solar, and hydroelectric power), implementing carbon capture and storage technologies, and protecting and restoring forests. Additionally, adaptation measures like infrastructure improvements to protect coastal areas, water management strategies to handle droughts, and wildlife habitat conservation efforts are being developed to address the impacts of climate change on the environment and vulnerable communities.  In summary, the final step in the process is the intensification of the greenhouse effect due to increased human activities, leading to global warming and climate change, which require both mitigation and adaptation efforts to address the environmental and societal impacts that result from these changes."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Could you please translate this to English?","output":"The original German sentence \\"Wie stabil sind die Gebiete, aus denen wir Energiequellen einführen können?\\" translates to \\"How stable are the regions from which we can import energy sources?\\" in English. Now, providing a detailed answer to the translated question: To determine the stability of the regions from which we can import various energy sources, we will analyze key energy resources: fossil fuels (oil, natural gas, and coal), nuclear power, and renewable resources (solar, wind, and hydroelectric power). 1. Fossil fuels: a) Oil: Major oil-exporting countries include Saudi Arabia, Russia, the United States, Iraq, and Canada. Political situations in these countries and their regions are relatively stable, aside from volatility in the Middle East. The stability of oil prices can be a concern due to trade tensions, conflicts, and production changes. b) Natural Gas: The largest natural gas exporters are Russia, Qatar, the United States, and Australia. Regions such as Russia, the United States, and Australia provide relative geopolitical stability, while geopolitical tensions in the Persian Gulf could affect Qatar-based exports. c) Coal: Major exporters of coal are Australia, Indonesia, Russia, and the United States. These nations provide a relatively stable region for coal imports. 2. Nuclear power: Nuclear power is primarily imported in the form of fuel, Uranium. Key suppliers are Australia, Kazakhstan, and Canada. These countries provide a stable mining environment and a consistent supply of resources. 3. Renewable resources: a) Solar: Solar energy infrastructure is largely manufactured in China. With China's current economic and political climate, the solar manufacturing market remains relatively stable and secure. b) Wind: Wind energy is produced by turbines, with major manufacturing centers located in Denmark, Germany, China, and the United States. Policies supporting renewable energy and the stability of these countries assure a reliable import of wind power infrastructure. c) Hydroelectric power: Equipment for hydroelectric plants is manufactured in countries like China, the United States, and Canada. Although hydroelectric resources rely on rivers, which can cross international boundaries, most disputes surrounding hydroelectric power are resolved through peaceful negotiations, ensuring stable importation. In conclusion, the stability of regions from which we can import various energy sources is influenced by a mix of geopolitical factors, trade relations, national policies, and global market conditions. It's crucial to monitor these variables and diversify energy sources to mitigate potential disruptions and risks."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

CNNMoney reports Mitsubishi Materials admitted in a statement Thursday at least two of its subsidiaries—Mitsubishi Cable Industries and Mitsubishi Shindoh—finagled data for cars, aircraft, and industrial machinery to meet client specs. Reuters notes a third subsidiary, Mitsubishi Aluminum Co., was also included. And Mitsubishi Cable, which faked data for about 270 million rubber sealant units sold to more than 220 clients, may have continued to falsify info even after it had been uncovered. The parent company says it hasn't found any legal or safety issues in regard to the first two subsidiaries mentioned; it's unclear if the same applies to Mitsubishi Aluminum. The country's economy and trade minister calls the development \\"a betrayal of trust in Japanese manufacturing.\\" The Wall Street Journal reports Mitsubishi Cable found out in February that factory workers had messed with the data, but it kept shipping products until the end of October as it investigated. Mitsubushi Materials says affected parts were mostly distributed in Japan, but some customers were located in China, and others may have been in the US. Other recent manufacturer scandals in Japan include Kobe Steel getting busted for manipulating inspection data on metals, as well as Nissan and Subaru taking heat for conducting improper vehicle inspections. All of this has led to what the Journal calls real \\"soul-searching\\" in Japan about how corporations are overseen by the government.

Voters can register on election day at their polling places with evidence of residency.Hubert Humphrey brought national attention to the state with his address at the 1948 Democratic National Convention. Minnesotans have consistently cast their Electoral College votes for Democratic presidential candidates since 1976, longer than any other state. Minnesota is the only state in the nation that did not vote for Ronald Reagan in either of his presidential runs. Minnesota has gone for the Democratic Party in every presidential election since 1960, with the exception of 1972, when it was carried by Republican Richard Nixon. Both the Democratic and Republican parties have major-party status in Minnesota, but its state-level \\"Democratic\\" party is actually a separate party, officially known as the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party (DFL). It was formed out of a 1944 alliance of the Minnesota Democratic and Farmer-Labor parties. The state has had active third-party movements. The Reform Party, now the Independence Party, was able to elect former mayor of Brooklyn Park and professional wrestler Jesse Ventura to the governorship in 1998. The Independence Party has received enough support to keep major-party status. The Green Party, while no longer having major-party status, has a large presence in municipal government, notably in Minneapolis and Duluth, where it competes directly with the DFL party for local offices. Major-party status in Minnesota (which grants state funding for elections) is reserved to parties whose candidates receive five percent or more of the vote in any statewide election (e.g., Governor, Secretary of State, U.S. President). The state's U.S. Senate seats... A:","output":"The current name of the third-party movement that was able to elect Jesse Ventura to the governorship in 1998 is the Independence Party.

Given the question: This article: Back in Paris with two years of his grant remaining, Bizet was temporarily secure financially and could ignore for the moment the difficulties that other young composers faced in the city. The two state-subsidised opera houses, the Opéra and the Opéra-Comique, each presented traditional repertoires that tended to stifle and frustrate new homegrown talent; only eight of the 54 Prix de Rome laureates between 1830 and 1860 had had works staged at the Opéra. Although French composers were better represented at the Opéra-Comique, the style and character of productions had remained largely unchanged since the 1830s. A number of smaller theatres catered for operetta, a field in which Offenbach was then paramount, while the Théâtre Italien specialised in second-rate Italian opera. The best prospect for aspirant opera composers was the Théâtre Lyrique company which, despite repeated financial crises, operated intermittently in various premises under its resourceful manager Léon Carvalho. This company had staged the first performances of Gounod's Faust and his Roméo et Juliette, and of a shortened version of Berlioz's Les Troyens.On 13 March 1861, Bizet attended the Paris premiere of Wagner's opera Tannhäuser, a performance greeted by audience riots that were stage-managed by the influential Jockey-Club de Paris. Despite this distraction, Bizet revised his opinions of Wagner's music, which he had previously dismissed as merely eccentric. He now declared Wagner \\"above and beyond all living composers\\". Thereafter, accusations of \\"Wagnerism\\" were often laid against Bizet, throughout his compositional career.As a pianist, Bizet had showed considerable skill from his earliest years. A contemporary asserted that he could have assured a future on the concert platform, but chose to conceal his talent \\"as though it were a vice\\". In May 1861 Bizet gave a rare demonstration of his virtuoso skills when, at a dinner party at which Liszt was present, he astonished everyone by playing on sight, flawlessly, one of the maestro's most... contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the maestro who's music was played in May 1861 by the pianist who had shown considerable skill from his earliest years?, what is it ?

Andy studied nocturnal animals, while Nate studied diurnal animals.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which zoologist learned less about animals that are sleeping during the day?  Hint: Animals may avoid becoming prey by living out of sight of predators, whether in caves, burrows, or by being nocturnal. Nocturnality is an animal behavior characterized by activity during the night and sleeping during the day. This is a behavioral form of detection avoidance called crypsis used by animals to either avoid predation or to enhance prey hunting. Predation risk has long been recognized as critical in shaping behavioral decisions. For example, this predation risk is of prime importance in determining the time of evening emergence in echolocating bats. Although early access during brighter times permits easier foraging, it also leads to a higher predation risk from bat hawks and bat falcons. This results in an optimum evening emergence time that is a compromise between the conflicting demands.Another nocturnal adaptation can be seen in kangaroo rats. They forage in relatively open habitats, and reduce their activity outside their nest burrows in response to moonlight. During a full moon, they shift their activity towards areas of relatively dense cover to compensate for the extra brightness. Answer:","output":"The zoologist who learned less about animals that are sleeping during the day is Nate. This is because Nate studied diurnal animals, which are animals that are active during the day and sleep at night. On the other hand, Andy studied nocturnal animals, which are active during the night and sleep during the day. Nocturnal animals have developed various adaptations to help them avoid predation or enhance prey hunting, such as shifting their activity based on moonlight or optimizing the time of their emergence in the evening. Diurnal animals, like those studied by Nate, are typically more active during the day and less likely to be sleeping or hiding from predators during daytime hours. Thus, Nate would have had less exposure to the behaviors and adaptations of animals that sleep during the day compared to Andy, who specifically focused on nocturnal animals and their unique characteristics in relation to daytime inactivity and nighttime activities."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

If you're using a cooler with a lid, screw the lid on and leave it in a cool place while the turkey brines. The cooler with the turkey and brine should keep the turkey at 38 °F (3 °C) or below. If you think the cooler isn't keeping the turkey cold enough, refrigerate it.","output":"To prepare a turkey for roasting using the brining method, start by removing the brine from the refrigerator on the morning of the day you plan to roast the turkey or the night before. You'll need to pour the brine into a large, food-safe container with a capacity of at least 5 US gallons (19 liters), such as a bucket or cooler. A 5-gallon (19-liter) drink cooler is an ideal choice due to its insulation and built-in drain spout, which makes cleaning up easier. Next, add ice water to the container and mix it well with the brine. At this point, it's time to prepare the turkey. Remove it from the refrigerator, extract the innards, and dispose of them, alongside the pop-up thermometer, if your turkey is equipped with one. Now you're ready to place the turkey, breast-side down, into the container filled with brine, ensuring that it is fully submerged. If the turkey is not completely covered in brine, use a heavy plate or dish to weigh it down. Once the turkey is properly submerged, cover the container and place it in the refrigerator so that the turkey can brine. If you're using a cooler with a screw-on lid, simply secure the lid and store the cooler in a cool area, allowing the turkey to brine. The goal is to maintain the turkey's temperature at or below 38°F (3°C) throughout the brining process. If you're concerned that your cooler may not be providing adequate cold storage, opt to refrigerate the turkey to maintain the ideal temperature. By following the steps above, you'll ensure a well-brined turkey ready for roasting, leading to a tender, juicy, and flavorful final product."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

He wants to work with his hero, Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas), a legendary Wall Street player. After calling Gekko's office 59 days in a row trying to land an appointment, Bud visits Gekko on his birthday with a box of Gekko's favorite, contraband Cuban cigars. Impressed at his sheer boldness, Gekko grants Bud an interview. Bud pitches him stocks, but Gekko is unimpressed. Desperate, Bud provides him some inside information about Bluestar Airlines, which Bud learned in a casual conversation from his father, Carl (Martin Sheen), the union leader for the company's maintenance workers. Intrigued, Gekko tells Bud he will think about it, but also that he \\"[looks] at a hundred deals a day,\\" but \\"[chooses] one.\\" A dejected Bud returns to his office. However, Gekko places an order for Bluestar stock and becomes one of Bud's clients. Gekko gives Bud some capital to manage, but the other stocks Bud selects lose money. Gekko gives Bud another chance, and tells him to spy on British CEO Sir Lawrence Wildman (Terence Stamp) and discern Wildman's next move. Bud learns that Wildman is making a bid for a steel company. Through Bud's spying, Gekko makes big money, and Wildman is forced to buy Gekko's shares off him to complete his takeover. Bud becomes wealthy, enjoying Gekko's promised perks, including a penthouse on Manhattan's Upper East Side and a trophy girlfriend, interior decorator Darien (Daryl Hannah). Bud is promoted to a senior stockbroker as a result of the large commission fees he is bringing in from Gekko's trading, and is given a corner office with a view. He continues to maximize inside information and use friends as straw buyers to provide more income for him and Gekko.

In the given equation, we have a constant on the right-hand side that can be simplified. So let's do that: 10*m = 13 + 7 10*m = 20 Step 2: Solve for m. Now, we have a simplified equation where 10 times m is equal to 20: 10*m = 20 To get the value of m, we simply need to isolate m by dividing both sides of the equation by 10: (10*m) / 10 = 20 / 10 This simplification gives us: m = 2 So, m is equal to 2 in this case."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

His eyes awoke with a passionate, determined flame, though the only light came from the glutted moon. Allan filled page after page, the words escaping from his mind onto the paper. Where before they had marched in regiments, practiced in ranks and followed their leaders' commands, the words now escaped in their true forms, unhindered by any stricture.

Step 2: Consider whether the information supports or contradicts our hypothesis - None of the information in the context directly suggests that Spring Lake is loaded with fish.

Regardless of the way the tension between universities, individual scientists, and the scientific revolution itself is perceived, there was a discernible impact on the way that university education was constructed. Aristotelian epistemology provided a coherent framework not simply for knowledge and knowledge construction, but also for the training of scholars within the higher education setting. The creation of new scientific constructs during the scientific revolution, and the epistemological challenges that were inherent within this creation, initiated the idea of both the autonomy of science and the hierarchy of the disciplines. Instead of entering higher education to become a \\"general scholar\\" immersed in becoming proficient in the entire curriculum, there emerged a type of scholar that put science first and viewed it as a vocation in itself. The divergence between those focused on science and those still entrenched in the idea of a general scholar exacerbated the epistemological tensions that were already beginning to emerge. Where did students after the scientific revolution put science on the scale of importance?","output":"After the scientific revolution, students who focused on science started to put science at the top of the scale of importance.

Q:Generate a question about the following movie plot: A U.S. Navy pilot, Neil Smith (Steve Taschler), is caught in a mysterious storm of butterflies and crash-lands his plane whilst flying over a remote part of Korea. He is found by local villagers who nurse him back to health. In the small village of Dongmakgol, time appears to stand still. They have no knowledge of modern technology, such as firearms, explosives, motor vehicles and aircraft. All villagers are unaware of the massive conflict within Korea. Meanwhile, not far from the village, a platoon of North Korean and South Korean soldiers have an encounter, and the ensuing gunfight leaves most of the North Koreans dead. The surviving soldiers from the North manage to escape through a mountain passage. The North Korean soldiers, Rhee Soo-hwa (Jung Jae-young), Jang Young-hee (Im Ha-ryong), and Seo Taek-gi (Ryu Deok-hwan) are found by an odd girl Yeo-il (Kang Hye-jung) who acts crazy.

Answer the following question: Thanks for the A2A Josh: Tough one to reduce to just a single incident but I’ll try. I grew up in North Central Indiana, about 50 miles south of South Bend. It was common to have frequent snow accumulation in the winter and blustery, freezing temps. It seems like this was particularly true during my childhood in the 70’s and 80’s. My family was blue collar through and through. We lived in the heartland in a town of just a few hundred with a sawmill and an on again off again gas station as our only two businesses. My dad worked in a factory for roughly 45 years. He apparently started that job right out of high school. My mom was an incredibly hard worker and Still is to this day. She did factory work, restaurant management and everything in between. It was this Protestant work ethic that led to one of the frequent tasks that my brother and I had to do which was not fun but ultimately was a very good deed. As I said, winters were often snowy and harsh. So my mom would make my brother and me shovel driveways and sidewalks for a couple of elderly residents. We did this of course, after we did our own driveway. Some people had motorized snowblowers but we did not. Standard snow shovels were our tools. I remember us whining about the chore, wishing we could just play in the snow or get out of it altogether. I don’t remember being overly conscious of the relief this provided for our elderly neighbors. I just remember that Mom would be disappointed if we didn’t do a good job. Later in life I would have great appreciation for the things required of me by my parents. Factory work and summer farm jobs helped us learn the value of hard work and would set us on a road to appreciation of future job opportunities that were less taxing. I still remember hating shoveling snow. But I’m forever grateful that I did it. Question: What does the man make his children do now that he is grown? Options: - not enough information   - He makes them rest during a storm.   - He makes his children shovel elderly neighbor's sidewalks.   - He makes them do homework instead of help neighbors. === The correct answer is Answer:","output":"- not enough information"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

If \\"Several people with painted faces are standing on a crowded sidewalk.\\", does it logically follow that \\"Some of the people in the crowd are dressed as clowns.\\"?","output":"No, it does not logically follow that \\"Some of the people in the crowd are dressed as clowns.\\" from the statement \\"Several people with painted faces are standing on a crowded sidewalk.\\" Let's break this down logically: The initial statement tells us two main things: 1. There are several people with painted faces. 2. These people are standing on a crowded sidewalk. Painting one's face is a fairly common practice for various reasons and in numerous contexts. This could include cultural ceremonies, protests, parties, sports events, and many more. A painted face, on its own, does not identify someone as a clown. Clowns typically have a very specific style of face painting, which includes exaggerated features like oversized lips and eyes, and a combination of particular colors. Even in the context of a costume, a painted face could mean so many things - one could be dressed as a zombie, a superhero, a vampire, a tiger, or even a work of abstract art. Furthermore, it is also entirely possible to have a painted face and be dressed in everyday, casual clothing, meaning the individuals are not necessarily 'dressed up' as anything. The second part of the statement explains that these people with painted faces are standing on a crowded sidewalk. It is important to note that \\"crowded sidewalk\\" is a vague term that doesn't give us any context about the reason the crowd has gathered. It could be for a parade, a protest, a street performance, waiting in line for a popular restaurant or show, or it could just be a particularly busy time of day in a bustling city. Without context, we cannot make assumptions about the nature of the crowd, nor the reason for the face painting. Long story short, simply because several people with painted faces are standing on a crowded sidewalk, it does not automatically mean that some of the people in the crowd are dressed as clowns. For that, we need further information about how they are dressed, how their faces are painted and what the occasion is. Until we have that, any connection to them being clowns is pure speculation, not a logical consequence."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Which county contributed less to acid rain formation?  Thorn county used fossil fuels for their energy needs, while Plant county used nuclear power. They both polluted the environment in different ways.  Hint: In the U.S., the majority of electricity is produced by burning coal or other fossil fuels. This causes air pollution that harms the health of living things. The air pollution also causes acid rain and contributes to global warming. In addition, fossil fuels are nonrenewable resources, so if we keep using them, they will eventually run out. The main advantage of nuclear energy is that it doesn’t release air pollution or cause the other environmental problems associated with the burning of fossil fuels. On the other other hand, radioactive elements are nonrenewable like fossil fuels and could eventually be used up. Answer:","output":"Based on the provided paragraph, Plant county contributed less to acid rain formation as it used nuclear power for their energy needs. While both counties polluted the environment in different ways, it is mentioned that the majority of electricity produced in the U.S. comes from burning coal or other fossil fuels, which leads to air pollution, acid rain, and global warming. Nuclear energy, on the other hand, does not release air pollution nor contribute to the formation of acid rain as it does not involve burning fossil fuels.

Next, place a bowl of hot soup next to the stain and allow the steam to inadvertently drift over the stain. Now, instead of using a stain remover, sprinkle some flower seeds over the wet shirt. Finally, tie a couple of balloons to the shirt and release it into the sky, allowing the wind and the act of floating to not effectively remove the stain."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The discovery of infrared radiation is ascribed to William Herschel, the astronomer, in the early 19th century. Herschel published his results in 1800 before the Royal Society of London. Herschel used a prism to refract light from the sun and detected the infrared, beyond the red part of the spectrum, through an increase in the temperature recorded on a thermometer. He was surprised at the result and called them \\"Calorific Rays\\". The term 'Infrared' did not appear until late in the 19th century. To whom did Herschel present his work on infrared radiation?","output":"Herschel presented his work on infrared radiation to the Royal Society of London in 1800."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Finland was very aware of environmental pollution and acted accordingly, while Russian practiced conventional agriculture and used fertilizers.  But I can use this background: Marine pollution is a generic term for the entry into the ocean of potentially hazardous chemicals or particles. The biggest culprits are rivers and with them many agriculture fertilizer chemicals as well as livestock and human waste. The excess of oxygen-depleting chemicals leads to hypoxia and the creation of a dead zone.Marine debris, which is also known as marine litter, describes human-created waste floating in a body of water. Oceanic debris tends to accumulate at the center of gyres and coastlines, frequently washing aground where it is known as beach litter.  What is an answer for this question: Which country caused fewer hazardous particles to reach into the ocean?","output":"Based on the given information, Finland caused fewer hazardous particles to reach the ocean. Finland was more conscious of environmental pollution and took appropriate actions to mitigate its impact, while Russia practiced conventional agriculture, which involved the use of chemical fertilizers. These fertilizers often contribute to marine pollution by introducing excess nutrients and oxygen-depleting chemicals into the ocean through river discharge. This can lead to hypoxic conditions and dead zones, which are harmful to marine ecosystems. Therefore, it can be concluded that Finland, by being more environmentally responsible, contributed less to marine pollution in comparison to Russia."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Neighborhood Legal Services, which provides free legal services to the poor, has expanded into the San Gabriel and Pomona valleys, areas with large Asian populations, many of whom speak limited or no English. Language is their biggest obstacle, but the Asian communities' cultural isolation and service providers' lack of cultural expertise also play a part, said NLS executive director Neal Dubovitz. And with 13 percent to 15 percent of the Asian population in the U.S. living below the poverty line, NLS services are badly needed, Dubovitz said. \\"Although it is a significant part of the poverty population, Asians historically have not been able to participate in the services and programs available to the poor,\\" he said. From simple telephone advice to complete legal representation in court, the agency provides free consumer, health, family, immigration, housing, public benefits and labor legal services to people who earn under 1,380 per month. Legal service providers have long served large Latino populations, who have cultural diversity but share a common language. \\"I remember the days when there were only a handful of people in the legal offices who spoke Spanish,\\" Dudovitz said. \\"Now Spanish and English are interchangeable. Our goal is to have that for the major Asian languages as well.\\" Before the expansion, only a few NLS lawyers spoke Asian languages, said attorney Rebecca Yee, who was hired by NLS in April 2002 to design and head the project. \\"Now we have people speaking Cantonese, Mandarin, Thai, Khmer (from Cambodia), Korean, Vietnamese, Japanese and Tagalog,\\" Yee said. One of the 13 attorneys hired to work with the program is Irene Mak, a family law attorney who speaks Cantonese, Mandarin and Thai. Mak was a partner at a private law firm before she went to work for NLS two years ago, earning up to 20,000 less a year working on domestic violence cases. \\"The job is more satisfying than the money,\\" said Mak, who grew up in Hong Kong and Thailand before coming to the United States. \\"I could use my language skills and wanted to give back to the Asian community.\\" NLS expanded when Legal Services Corp., the federal agency that funds providers of free legal services nationwide, reduced the number of grantees in the Los Angeles area from five to three, Dudovitz said. NLS won the competitive grant over the Legal Services Program for Pasadena, San Gabriel-Pomona valleys. That boosted its client base from 16,000 to around 25,000, and NLS opened an office in El Monte.

Jackson's confectionary vocals are masterfully complemented by gentle harmonies and balanced out by pulsing rhythms, so she's never unpleasant to listen to.\\"Matthew Perpetus of Fluxblog suggested Jackson's vocal techniques as a study for indie rock music, considering it to possess \\"a somewhat subliminal effect on the listener, guiding and emphasizing dynamic shifts without distracting attention from its primal hooks.\\" Perpetus added: \\"Her voice effortlessly transitions from a rhythmic toughness to soulful emoting to a flirty softness without overselling any aspect of her performance ... a continuum of emotions and attitudes that add up to the impression that we're listening to the expression of a fully-formed human being with contradictions and complexities.\\"Jackson's music has encompassed a broad range of genres.

Article: A thousand years ago, Hong Kong was covered by a thick forest. As more and more people came to live in Hong Kong, these trees were cut down and burnt.  Now there is no forest left, though there are still some small areas covered with trees. We call these woods. Elephants, tigers and many other animals were living in the thick forest. When people came to live in Hong Kong, the animals began to die out. Early farmers grew rice and kept pigs and chickens in the valleys. They cut down the trees and burnt them. They needed fire to keep themselves warm in winter, to cook their food and to keep away the dangerous animals. Elephants quickly disappeared because there was not enough food for them. Many other animals soon died in the same way. You might think that there are no longer any animals in Hong Kong except in 2005. But there are still about 36 different animals living there. One of the most interesting of Hong Kong's animals is the barking deer. These are beautiful little animals with a rich brown coat and a white patch under the tail. They look like deer but they are much smaller. They are less than two feet high. They make a noise rather like a dog barking. In Hong Kong the barking deer has only a real enemy---- men.

Step 1: Understand the nature of the question and context. The question asks for the name given by the Portuguese to the region now known as Mumbai. Mumbai is a city located on the western coast of India and has a rich history of colonial interactions. Step 2: Research the Portuguese presence in India. The Portuguese established their presence in India in the early 16th century, with the arrival of Vasco da Gama in 1498. They set up numerous trading posts and forts along the western coast of India, including territories in and around the area now known as Mumbai. Step 3: Identify the Portuguese name for Mumbai. The Portuguese referred to Mumbai as \\"Bombaim\\" during their colonization. The name is derived from the Portuguese words \\"bom\\" (good) and \\"bahia\\" (bay), which translates to \\"good bay.\\" This name was used during the Portuguese rule in the region, from the mid-16th century until the British took over the area in the mid-17th century. Step 4: Verify the accuracy of the information. Cross-check the name \\"Bombaim\\" with multiple reliable sources, such as historical records, academic articles, and reputable websites, to ensure the accuracy and authenticity of the information. Step 5: Provide the answer.
