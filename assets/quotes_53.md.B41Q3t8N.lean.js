Then:    [    f(k) - 5 = 8 - 5 = 3    ]    Thus:    [    (k-a)(k-b)(k-c)(k-d) cdot g(k) = 3    ] 5. **Analysis of the product:** (k-a, k-b, k-c, k-d) are four integers. Notice that:    - Because (k-a, k-b, k-c, k-d) are integers    - The product of these four integers, multiplied by (g(k)) which is another integer, will give (3), which is a small number. 6. **Possible values analysis:** In order for the product ((k-a)(k-b)(k-c)(k-d) cdot g(k)=3):    - The factors ((k-a), (k-b), (k-c), (k-d)) must include very small integers (either close to 1 or -1 because they have to yield a product of 3).    - Since (3) is a small number and non-zero, some of these integers (k-a, k-b, k-c, k-d) must equal (pm 1) or include combinations like ({1, -1, 3, -3}).     - Because these factors are distinct, at least one pair will repeat if at least three of (k-a, k-b, k-c, k-d) are (pm 1), which contradicts that (a, b, c,) and (d) are distinct (each factor would need to be unique for a distinct set of (a, b, c, d)). 7. **Contradiction and conclusion:** This means that it is impossible for four distinct integers multiplied together to yield a product of (3) when their differences with (k) are restricted to small values.

When the small ball is submerged, 10% of ( V ) overflows. Thus, the overflow volume due to the small ball is ( 0.1V ). 3. **Determine Volume of Each Ball**:    - Given the volume ratios, let the volume of the large ball be ( 10x ), the medium ball be ( 5x ), and the small ball be ( 3x ). 4. **Relate Overflow to Ball Volumes**:    - According to the problem, the small ball's volume ( 3x ) matches the 10% overflow, giving ( 3x = 0.1V ).

Since M is paid 120 percent of the sum paid to N, we can write this as: Amount paid to M = 120% of Amount paid to N Given that N is paid Rs. 250 per week, we can substitute this value into the equation: Amount paid to M = 120% of Rs. 250 To calculate 120% of Rs. 250, we convert the percentage to a decimal by dividing by 100: 120% = 120 / 100 = 1.2 Now we multiply this decimal by the amount paid to N: Amount paid to M = 1.2 * Rs. 250 Amount paid to M = Rs. 300 Now that we have the amount paid to M, we can find the total amount paid to both M and N by adding their individual amounts: Total amount paid to M and N = Amount paid to M + Amount paid to N Total amount paid to M and N = Rs. 300 (paid to M) + Rs. 250 (paid to N) Total amount paid to M and N = Rs. 550 Therefore, the total amount paid to M and N per week is Rs. boxed{550} ."},{"instruction":"f point A(a,a2) lies on the xaxis, then the coordinates of point B(a+2,a1) are ( ).

Therefore, a=-3 is the condition for parallelism, making option A incorrect since it suggests both values without specifying the coincidence condition for a=1. **Option B: If the intercepts of l_{2} on the x-axis and y-axis are equal** The intercepts are equal either if l_{2} passes through the origin or its slope is -1. Setting a-2=0 for the x-intercept equals the y-intercept gives a=2. For the slope condition, frac{a}{2a-3}=-1 gives a=1. Hence, a can be 2 or 1, making option B incorrect as it only mentions a=1. **Option C: If l_{1} is perpendicular to l_{2}** For two lines to be perpendicular, the product of their slopes must be -1. Thus, [ 1times a + atimes (3-2a) = 0 ] Solving this gives a=0 or a=2, which matches option C exactly. Therefore, option C is correct. **Option D: If l_{1} is parallel to l_{2}, then the distance between l_{1} and l_{2}** Given a=-3, we rewrite l_{1} and l_{2} as l_{1}: x-3y+3=0 and l_{2}: -3x+9y-5=0, which simplifies to l_{2}: x-3y+frac{5}{3}=0. The distance between two parallel lines Ax+By+C_1=0 and Ax+By+C_2=0 is given by frac{|C_1-C_2|}{sqrt{A^2+B^2}}. Applying this formula gives: [ frac{left|3-frac{5}{3}right|}{sqrt{1^2+(-3)^2}} = frac{frac{4}{3}}{sqrt{10}} = frac{2sqrt{10}}{15} ] Thus, option D is correct, as it accurately describes the distance between l_{1} and l_{2} when they are parallel with a=-3.

For this case, we have: - 4 + 4 > 9 (True) - 4 + 9 > 4 (True) - 4 + 9 > 4 (True) However, upon closer inspection, we realize that for an isosceles triangle with two equal sides, the two equal sides must be longer than the base to form a triangle.

Expand and rearrange the equation to form a quadratic equation. 2. Solve the quadratic equation to find the values of x. The solutions are x_1 = 95 and x_2 = 135. Since x_2 = 135 is not feasible (the selling price must not be less than 90 yuan and not exceed 110 yuan), we discard it. Therefore, the selling price should be set at: [ boxed{95 text{ yuan}} ]  Part 3: Maximizing Weekly Sales Profit To maximize the weekly sales profit without exceeding a selling price of 110 yuan, we express the profit w as: [ w = (x - 80)(-10x + 1500) = -10(x - 115)^2 + 12250 ] Given that -10 < 0, the profit function opens downwards, indicating a maximum value at the vertex of the parabola. Since the selling price must not exceed 110 yuan, we find the maximum profit when x = 110: [ w_{text{max}} = -10(110 - 115)^2 + 12250 = 12000 ] Thus, to maximize the weekly sales profit: [ boxed{text{The selling price is } 110 text{ yuan, and the maximum profit is } 12000 text{ yuan.}} ]"},{"instruction":"57°cos27°cos57°sin27°=（　　） A: frac {1}{2} B: frac {1}{3} C: frac { sqrt {3}}{2} D: frac { sqrt {3}}{3}","output":"The solution is as follows: sin57°cos27°-cos57°sin27°=sin（57°-27°）=sin30° = boxed{frac {1}{2}}.

Since P can finish the job in 3 hours, P can complete 1/3 of the job in one hour. Similarly, Q can finish the job in 15 hours, so Q can complete 1/15 of the job in one hour. When P and Q work together for 2 hours, they can complete a combined portion of the job. In one hour, together they can complete 1/3 (P's rate) + 1/15 (Q's rate) of the job. Let's calculate their combined rate: 1/3 + 1/15 = 5/15 + 1/15 = 6/15 = 2/5 of the job per hour. In 2 hours, working together, they complete: 2 hours * 2/5 of the job/hour = 4/5 of the job. This means that after 2 hours of working together, they have 1 - 4/5 = 1/5 of the job left to complete. Now, we need to find out how long it will take P to finish the remaining 1/5 of the job, working alone at his constant rate. Since P can complete 1/3 of the job in one hour, we can set up the following equation to find out how long it will take P to complete 1/5 of the job: (1/3) * t = 1/5 Now, we solve for t: t = (1/5) / (1/3) t = (1/5) * (3/1) t = 3/5 hours To convert hours to minutes, we multiply by 60 minutes per hour: 3/5 hours * 60 minutes/hour = 36 minutes Therefore, it will take P an additional boxed{36}  minutes to finish the job, working alone at his constant rate."},{"instruction":"the figure, there is a point ( M ) on the side ( A A^{prime} B^{prime} B ) of the rectangular prism ( A B C D  A^{prime} B^{prime} C^{prime} D^{prime} ) such that the distance from ( M ) to the lines ( AB ) and ( B^{prime} C^{prime} ) is equal.

Therefore, the function is f(x) = a^x - a^{-x}. (2) Given f(1) = frac{15}{4}, we have a - frac{1}{a} = frac{15}{4}, which yields a = 4. Thus, f(x) = 4^x - 4^{-x}. Now, let's consider g(x) = a^{2x} + a^{-2x} - 2f(x) = 4^{2x} + 4^{-2x} - 2(4^x - 4^{-x}). This can be rewritten as g(x) = (4^x - 4^{-x})^2 - 2(4^x - 4^{-x}) + 2. Let t = 4^x - 4^{-x}. Since f(x) is an increasing function on [0, 1], we have t in left[0, frac{15}{4}right]. Now consider h(t) = t^2 - 2t + 2, which is an upward-opening parabola with its axis of symmetry at t = 1.

(3) From part (2), we have f(2x) = 4^{2x} - 4^{-2x} = (4^x + 4^{-x})(4^x - 4^{-x}). The given inequality is f(2x) geq lambda cdot f(x), or (4^x + 4^{-x})(4^x - 4^{-x}) geq lambda cdot (4^x - 4^{-x}). Assuming such a positive integer lambda exists, we have three cases based on the value of x: - Case 1: x = 0. The inequality holds for all real lambda. - Case 2: x in left(0, frac{1}{2}right]. In this case, 4^x - 4^{-x} > 0, so the inequality simplifies to 4^x + 4^{-x} geq lambda.

This can be re-written as f(x) = 1 + frac{1}{x} to make its behavior more apparent. 2. **Properties of f(x)**: The re-written form of f(x), 1 + frac{1}{x}, suggests that the graph of f(x) has a center of symmetry at the point (0, 1). This is because for any value of x (except x = 0), the function will yield values symmetrically distributed around the point (0, 1) when considering x and -x. 3. **Given Function g(x)**: The function g(x) - 1 is stated to be an odd function. Odd functions satisfy the property g(-x) = -g(x) for all x in their domain. The subtraction of 1 from g(x) does not alter its odd nature but shifts the graph vertically. 4. **Symmetry of g(x)**: Since g(x) - 1 is an odd function and defined over mathbb{R}, and considering the symmetry property from f(x), we infer that the graph of g(x) itself would have a center of symmetry that aligns with that of f(x), which is at (0, 1). 5. **Intersection Points**: Given that the graphs of f(x) and g(x) intersect at four points A, B, C, and D, and considering their symmetry properties, it follows that these points are symmetric with respect to the point (0, 1). This symmetry implies that any vertical displacement caused by the functions at these points would be balanced when considering the sum of their y-coordinates. 6. **Sum of y-Coordinates**: Since the points are symmetrically distributed and considering the nature of f(x) and g(x), the sum of the y-coordinates of the intersection points (y_{1}+y_{2}+y_{3}+y_{4}) would equal the sum of the y-values at the center of symmetry multiplied by the number of points, which is 4 times 1 = 4.

(2) The distance from the center of the circle ( (0, -2) ) to the line ( l ) can be found using the formula for the distance from a point ( (x_0, y_0) ) to a line ( Ax + By + C = 0 ):  d = frac{|Ax_0 + By_0 + C|}{sqrt{A^2 + B^2}}  Substituting the values for the line ( l: A = 1, B = sqrt{3}, C = -10 ) and the center of the circle ( (x_0, y_0) = (0, -2) ), we find:  d = frac{|1cdot0 + sqrt{3}cdot(-2) - 10|}{sqrt{1^2 + (sqrt{3})^2}}   d = frac{|-2sqrt{3} - 10|}{sqrt{4}}   d = frac{10 + 2sqrt{3}}{2}   d = 5 + sqrt{3}  The maximum distance from any point ( P ) on the circle to the line ( l ) would be the sum of the distance ( d ) and the circle's radius ( sqrt{2} ), since the farthest point on the circle from the line lies on the line through the center of the circle perpendicular to ( l ).

Let's denote the sides of the pentagon as (a = 1), (b = 2), (c = 5), (d = 6), and (e = 7). 2. To prove that we cannot inscribe a circle in this pentagon, we will use a known fact for inscribing a circle in a polygon: If a circle can be inscribed in a polygon, the sum of any two non-adjacent sides must be less than the sum of the remaining three sides. 3. According to this theorem, we will examine the sums of the sides of our pentagon. 4. First, let's consider side (e = 7). We need to check if the sum of any two non-adjacent sides is less than the sum of the remaining three sides. For instance, calculate:     [     7 + 5 = 12     ]     and compare it with:     [     1 + 2 + 6 = 9     ]     Here, (7 + 5 > 1 + 2 + 6). 5.

Now, for the remaining sides, (c = 5) and (d = 6), we need to establish if they also satisfy the inscribing condition when compared:     [     5 + 6 = 11     ]     and compare it with:     [     1 + 2 + 7 = 10     ]     Here, again:     [     5 + 6 > 1 + 2 + 7     ] 7.

To find the number of cases where there is no carryover:    - Analyze the pairs of digits such that their sum does not exceed 9.     - For example:      - If one digit is 0, the other can be any digit from 0 to 9 (10 options).      - If one digit is 1, the other can be any digit from 0 to 8 (9 options).      - Continue this pattern until:      - If one digit is 9, the other can only be 0 (1 option). 3.

Each rhombus can then be rearranged to form a regular hexagon. 4. **Forming the Rhombuses**:    - Cut the outer hexagon along lines connecting each vertex of the outer hexagon to the corresponding vertex of the smaller, inner hexagon.    - This can be achieved by drawing lines from each vertex of the outer hexagon to the closest vertex of the inner hexagon.    - This results in 6 identical rhombuses, each having angles of ( 120^circ ) and ( 60^circ ). 5. **Reassembling the Pieces**:    - Take these identical rhombuses and rearrange them to form a new regular hexagon.    - Since the rhombuses are identical and each pair of adjacent rhombuses fits perfectly along a side, they form a regular hexagon. # Conclusion: Therefore, the method to cut the annular region formed by the outer and inner hexagons is to draw lines connecting the vertices of the inner and outer hexagons, producing 6 identical rhombuses that can be rearranged to form a regular hexagon. boxed{text{Use 6 identical rhombuses to form a regular hexagon.}}"},{"instruction":"The minimum value of the function f(x)=x2sin x on the interval left[0,pi right] is A: 0 B: pi  C: frac{π}{3}sqrt{3} D: frac{π}{6}1","output":"To find the minimum value of the function f(x)=x-2sin x on the interval left[0,pi right], we first compute its derivative to understand its behavior.

Consider the case where (5 nmid M). In this case, both (M+5) and (M-5) must be powers of 2. However, the difference between two powers of 2 is never 10 (since (M+5 - (M-5) = 10)).

Point M is the midpoint of hypotenuse BC, so BM = MC = frac{3sqrt{2}}{2}. 2. **Construct perpendiculars and prove triangle{EMI} is isosceles and right:**    Construct MF perp AB and MG perp AC. Since AM bisects angle BAC, MF = MG. By the properties of cyclic quadrilaterals and the perpendiculars, triangle MFI cong triangle MGE by AAS (Angle-Angle-Side), implying MI = ME. Since AIME is cyclic, angle EMI = 90^circ. Thus, triangle EMI is isosceles and right. 3. **Calculate the sides of triangle{EMI} using its area:**    Given the area of triangle{EMI} is 2, and it is a right isosceles triangle, let the equal legs be s.

We know that there are 10 slices left over, so the total number of slices before anyone ate was: 18 slices consumed + 10 slices left over = 28 slices. George purchased 3 small pizzas, which give 4 slices each, so the small pizzas provided: 3 small pizzas * 4 slices each = 12 slices. Now, let's subtract the slices from the small pizzas from the total number of slices to find out how many slices came from the large pizzas: 28 total slices - 12 slices from small pizzas = 16 slices from large pizzas. Since each large pizza gives 8 slices, we can find out how many large pizzas were purchased by dividing the number of slices from large pizzas by the number of slices per large pizza: 16 slices from large pizzas / 8 slices per large pizza = 2 large pizzas. Therefore, George purchased boxed{2}  large pizzas."},{"instruction":"The selling price of a popular product is m yuan, and the profit that can be earned in one month is left(m8right)left(90015mright).

First, let's expand and simplify the given expression for profit: begin{align*} y &= (m-8)(900-15m)  &= 900m - 15m^2 - 7200 + 120m  &= -15m^2 + 1020m - 7200. end{align*} To find the maximum profit, we need to rewrite this quadratic equation in vertex form, which is given by y = a(x-h)^2 + k, where (h, k) is the vertex of the parabola, and a is the coefficient of x^2. The vertex form gives us direct information about the maximum or minimum point of the parabola, depending on the sign of a. Since a = -15 in our case, the parabola opens downwards, indicating that the vertex represents the maximum point. Rewriting the equation in vertex form: begin{align*} y &= -15m^2 + 1020m - 7200  &= -15(m^2 - 68m + 480)  &= -15[(m^2 - 68m + 34^2) - 34^2 + 480]  &= -15[(m - 34)^2 - 1156 + 480]  &= -15(m - 34)^2 + 10140. end{align*} From this form, we can directly see that the maximum profit is achieved when m = 34, and the maximum profit itself is 10140 yuan.

The problem states that when greening an area of 400m^2 independently, Team A takes 4 days less than Team B. We can set up the following equation based on this information: [ frac{400}{2x} + 4 = frac{400}{x} ] Solving this equation for x: begin{align*} frac{400}{2x} + 4 &= frac{400}{x}  frac{400}{2x} + frac{4x}{x} &= frac{400}{x}  frac{400 + 4x^2}{2x} &= frac{400}{x}  400 + 4x^2 &= 2 cdot 400  4x^2 &= 400  x^2 &= 100  x &= 10 quad text{(Discarding the negative root as area per day cannot be negative)} end{align*} However, there seems to be a mistake in the calculation.

Calculate the number of equilateral triangles that can be formed such that their three vertices are vertices of the cube.","output":"To determine the number of equilateral triangles that can be formed using the vertices of a cube, we need to identify the possible side lengths of such triangles and count how many triangles can be constructed with each possible side length. Here are the detailed steps: 1. **Identify Possible Distances Between Vertices:**    In a cube, there are three distinct possible distances between any two vertices:    [    AB = ell, quad AR = ell sqrt{2}, quad text{and} quad PD = ell sqrt{3}    ] 2. **Examine Triangles with Side Length (ell):**    If an equilateral triangle has a side length of (ell), each side must coincide with an edge of the cube. However, in a cube, any two edges that meet at a vertex are always perpendicular, and hence cannot form an equilateral triangle with three equal ( ell )-length sides. Thus, there are no equilateral triangles with side length (ell). 3. **Examine Triangles with Side Length (ell sqrt{3}):**    The pairs of vertices that are (ell sqrt{3}) apart are:    [    {A, Q}, {B, R}, {S, C}, {P, D}    ]    Each pair of vertices (ell sqrt{3}) apart are on opposite corners of the cube. To form an equilateral triangle, we need three vertices that are mutually (ell sqrt{3}) apart. As there are no two (ell sqrt{3}) pairs sharing a common vertex, it is impossible to form an equilateral triangle of this side length. Thus, there are no equilateral triangles with side length (ell sqrt{3}). 4. **Examine Triangles with Side Length (ell sqrt{2}):**    We now check the feasibility of forming equilateral triangles with side length (ell sqrt{2}). Consider a vertex, e.g., (A). The vertices (ell sqrt{2}) away from (A) are (P), (R), and (C). These vertices form a set of 3 potential pairs:    [    {(A, P, R), (A, P, C), (A, R, C)}    ]    Therefore, from vertex (A), there are 3 such triangles.    Since this scenario is symmetric for each vertex of the cube, and each vertex forms similar sets of equilateral triangles:    [    text{Total triangles} = text{Number of vertices} times text{Triangles per vertex} = 8 times 3 = 24    ]    However, each triangle is counted three times (once at each vertex of the triangle).

Then the magician enters and points to another five coins that are facing the same way as the uncovered ones. Explain how the magician and the assistant should coordinate to make the trick successful.","output":"1. **Step 1: Understand the Problem**    - A spectator arranges 27 coins in a row, each coin either heads up or tails up.    - An assistant covers up all but five of these coins, with the five uncovered coins all showing the same side (all heads or all tails).    - A magician enters and identifies five more coins that show the same side as the uncovered ones. 2. **Step 2: Define a Strategy**    - The key to solving this problem is a communication strategy between the magician and the assistant. This strategy ensures that the magician can identify the five additional coins in their correct state, even though the assistant cannot communicate directly to the magician when he enters. 3. **Step 3: Divide the Problem into Smaller Parts**    - Divide the 27 coins into 9 groups of 3 coins each (a triplet).    [    27 text{ coins} = 9 times 3 text{ triplets}    ] 4. **Step 4: Analyze the Distribution of Coin States Within Triplets**    - In each triplet, there will be a mixture of heads and tails. Different combinations are possible, but the assistant will determine the state of each triplet:      - More heads than tails      - More tails than heads    - Without loss of generality, let's assume each triplet state as predominantly heads or tails. 5. **Step 5: The Assistant Covers All But Five Coins Strategically**    - Let’s say out of the nine triplets, five have more heads than tails (arbitrary choice, it could be tails as well). The assistant will then leave one coin uncovered from each of these five triplets which predominantly show heads.    - Example configuration where heads dominate:      - ( {H, H, T} ) - covering any of (H,H)      - ( {H, T, H} ) - covering any of (H,H)      - and so on for five triplets. 6. **Step 6: The Determined Communication**    - The trick lies in how the assistant decides which specific coin in each triplet to leave uncovered:      - Define a rule. For instance, if the leftmost two coins in a triplet are heads, the assistant uncovers the left coin. This specific pattern will inform the magician about the positioning of heads within that triplet.      - Possible rules for assistant:        - Two leftmost heads: uncover the leftmost coin.        - Two rightmost heads: uncover the middle coin.        - Left and right heads: uncover the rightmost coin.    - These rules allow the magician to infer the specific hidden heads coins in the other triplets based on the position of the uncovered coin. 7. **Step 7: The Magician’s Task**    - When the magician enters, he sees the five uncovered coins and remembers the agreed pattern.    - With the predetermined pattern, the magician deciphers the exact combination of heads positions in each triplet and thus guesses correctly which other five coins (still covered) will show heads. # Conclusion This combination and hidden message deciphering complete the focus trick successfully. The communication strategy of placement and the position patterns allow the magician to identify the correct state of the coins. The implementation assures that the magician can deduce without any further cues. The exact patterns need to be practiced and perfected.

The number of ways to choose these four cards is:    [    63 times 62 times 61 times 60    ]     3. **Determining the Fifth Card**:    To complete the selection ensuring that each dot appears an even number of times, the fifth card must be such that it balances out the dots appearing in even quantities. 4. **Counting Specific Cases**:    - **Case 1: The Fifth Card Makes Each Dot Even Without Causing Duplicates or Emptiness**:      This would typically just be the remaining card that ensures each dot appears an even number of times.    - **Case 2: The Fifth Card is Empty**:      For the fifth card to be effectively empty, the first four cards already need to balance out each dot to appear an even number of times. The calculation:      [      63 times 62 times 60      ]      This counts how many ways to pick two cards, avoid one, and pick the third card ensuring even counts without the fourth balancing out.    - **Case 3: The Fifth Card is a Duplicate Within the First Four**:      This means one of the four cards is chosen again as the fifth card. This involves first selecting three cards that create such an even condition:      [      text{Number of ways to choose 2 cards} = 63 times 62      ]      - We pick slots for a duplicate: (4) ways.      - Choosing the duplicate: (60) remaining cards for the duplicate.      The total for this step:      [      63 times 62 times 4 times 60      ] 5. **Total Combinations and Adjusting for Overcounts**:    We subtract the cases where the fifth card is empty or a duplicate:    [    63 times 62 times 61 times 60 - 63 times 62 times 60 - 63 times 62 times 4 times 60    ] 6. **Final Calculation**:    Now, for the valid ordered combinations, we divide by the fact that order does not matter in selection of five cards. Hence, we divide by (5!) or (120):    [    frac{63 times 62 times 61 times 60 - 63 times 62 times 60 - 63 times 62 times 4 times 60}{120}    ] 7. **Simplify**:    [    frac{63 times 62 times (61 - 1 - 4)}{2} = frac{63 times 62 times 56}{2} = 63 times 31 times 56    ] 8. **Final Multiplication to Get the Answer**:    [    63 times 31 times 56 = 109368    ] # Conclusion: [ boxed{109368} ]"},{"instruction":"f x is 75 percent greater than 150, then x =","output":"To find x, which is 75 percent greater than 150, you can calculate it as follows: First, find 75 percent of 150: 75% of 150 = 0.75 * 150 = 112.5 Then, add this value to the original 150 to find x: x = 150 + 112.5 = 262.5 So, x = boxed{262.5}"},{"instruction":"Let ( A_{1}B_{1}C_{1}, A_{2}B_{2}C_{2} ), and ( A_{3}B_{3}C_{3} ) be three triangles in the plane.

For each of these doors, we will evaluate the number of times the door's state will be changed: 1. **Door 15:**    - The divisors of 15 are (1, 3, 5, 15).    - This means the door 15 will be toggled by numbers 1, 3, 5, and 15.    - Sequence of toggling: (T rightarrow D rightarrow T rightarrow D rightarrow T)    - Thus, the final state is *locked.* 2. **Door 30:**    - The divisors of 30 are (1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 30).    - This means door 30 will be toggled by numbers 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, and 30.    - Sequence of toggling: (T rightarrow D rightarrow T rightarrow D rightarrow T rightarrow D rightarrow T rightarrow D)    - Thus, the final state is *unlocked.* 3. **Door 45:**    - The divisors of 45 are (1, 3, 5, 9, 15, 45).    - This means door 45 will be toggled by numbers 1, 3, 5, 9, 15, and 45.    - Sequence of toggling: (T rightarrow D rightarrow T rightarrow D rightarrow T rightarrow D)    - Thus, the final state is *unlocked.* Therefore, **door 15 will unlock** the doors numbered 30 and 45.  Part (b) We need to demonstrate the final state of door number 10 and door number 9 after the number 50 passes through the corridor: 1. **Door 10:**    - The divisors of 10 are (1, 2, 5, 10).    - This means door 10 will be toggled four times (since it has 4 divisors).    - Sequence of toggling: (T rightarrow D rightarrow T rightarrow D)    - Thus, the final state is *locked.* 2. **Door 9:**    - The divisors of 9 are (1, 3, 9).    - This means door 9 will be toggled three times (since it has 3 divisors).    - Sequence of toggling: (T rightarrow D rightarrow T rightarrow D)    - Thus, the final state is *unlocked.* From this observation, we can conclude that doors with an even number of divisors will end up being locked, while doors with an odd number of divisors will end up being unlocked.  Part (c) To find all doors that will be unlocked after number 50 passes, we need to determine which doors have an odd number of divisors. A number ( k ) has an odd number of divisors if and only if ( k ) is a perfect square. Let's denote the set of perfect squares between 1 and 50: [ 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49 ] Thus, the doors that will be unlocked are those corresponding to these perfect squares.

We aim to find integers (a) and (b) such that (a+b = p) is a prime number. This ensures that (a) and (b) are coprime because a prime (p) cannot divide both (a) and (b) if their sum equals (p). 2. We consider the expression (a^b + b^a) modulo (p):    [    a^b + b^a equiv (-b)^b + b^a equiv b^a left( 1 + (-1)^b b^{b-a} right) pmod{p}    ] 3. If (b) is odd, then ((-1)^b = -1).

From y = 2t, we get t = frac{y}{2}.

Part 2: Finding the Minimum Value of |AB| **(2)** Given that the curve C is a circle with center C(0, 2) and radius 1, the distance |AB| can be found using the Pythagorean theorem, where |AB| = sqrt{|AC|^2 - 1}. To minimize |AB|, we need to minimize |AC|, which is the distance from point A on line l to the center of the circle C.

Sectors ( E ) and ( F ) need to be colored with the remaining colors:      - Here, ( B ) has 2 choices, and ( C ) must take a different color from ( B ).      - Independently, we color ( E ) and ( F ) with the remaining colors.      - This scenario results in 12 possible colorings. 4. **Total Number of Colorings**:     - Summing up the number of colorings from each case:       - Case 1: 6 colorings       - Case 2: 6 colorings       - Case 3: 12 colorings     [     text{Total} = 6 + 6 + 12 = 24 text{ colorings}     ] # Conclusion: The total number of ways to paint the circle using the given constraints is ( boxed{24} )."},{"instruction":"Does there exist a rectangle which can be divided into a regular hexagon with sidelength  1  and several congruent rightangled triangles with legs  1  and  sqrt{3} ?","output":"1. **Assume the existence of such a rectangle:**    Suppose there exists a rectangle with dimensions ( x times y ) that can be divided into a regular hexagon with side length 1 and several congruent right-angled triangles with legs 1 and (sqrt{3}). 2. **Express the dimensions in terms of natural numbers:**    Since the legs of the right-angled triangles are 1 and (sqrt{3}), we can express the dimensions ( x ) and ( y ) of the rectangle as:    [    x = a + bsqrt{3}, quad y = c + dsqrt{3}    ]    where ( a, b, c, d ) are natural numbers. 3. **Calculate the area of the rectangle:**    The area of the rectangle is:    [    text{Area} = x cdot y = (a + bsqrt{3})(c + dsqrt{3})    ]    Expanding this product, we get:    [    text{Area} = ac + adsqrt{3} + bcsqrt{3} + bd cdot 3 = ac + 3bd + (ad + bc)sqrt{3}    ]    Therefore, the area of the rectangle is an element of (mathbb{Z}[sqrt{3}]). 4. **Consider the area of the regular hexagon:**    The area of a regular hexagon with side length 1 is given by:    [    text{Area}_{text{hexagon}} = frac{3sqrt{3}}{2}    ] 5. **Consider the area of the right-angled triangles:**    Each right-angled triangle with legs 1 and (sqrt{3}) has an area of:    [    text{Area}_{text{triangle}} = frac{1}{2} cdot 1 cdot sqrt{3} = frac{sqrt{3}}{2}    ] 6. **Express the total area of the rectangle:**    Let ( n ) be the number of right-angled triangles. The total area of the rectangle is then:    [    text{Area}_{text{rectangle}} = text{Area}_{text{hexagon}} + n cdot text{Area}_{text{triangle}} = frac{3sqrt{3}}{2} + n cdot frac{sqrt{3}}{2}    ]    Simplifying, we get:    [    text{Area}_{text{rectangle}} = frac{3sqrt{3}}{2} + frac{nsqrt{3}}{2} = frac{(3 + n)sqrt{3}}{2}    ] 7. **Analyze the contradiction:**    For the area of the rectangle to be an element of (mathbb{Z}[sqrt{3}]), the coefficient of (sqrt{3}) must be an integer. Thus, we have:    [    frac{(3 + n)sqrt{3}}{2} = k + msqrt{3}    ]    for some integers ( k ) and ( m ). This implies:    [    frac{3 + n}{2} = m    ]    Since ( m ) is an integer, ( 3 + n ) must be even. However, ( 3 ) is odd, so ( n ) must be odd for ( 3 + n ) to be even. 8. **Contradiction with the number of triangles:**    The number of right-angled triangles ( n ) must be even because the perimeter of the rectangle must be an integer multiple of the sum of the legs of the triangles. This leads to a contradiction since ( n ) cannot be both odd and even. Therefore, no such rectangle exists.

We need to show that for any integer ( m > 1 ) such that ( gcd(m, n) = 1 ), there exist finitely many elements of ( A ) such that their sum is congruent to 1 modulo ( m ) and congruent to 0 modulo ( n ). 2. **Prime Factorization of ( m ):**    Let ( m = prod_{i=1}^k p_i^{e_i} ) be the prime factorization of ( m ).

We aim to prove that the problem is solvable if and only if: [ b cdot tan frac{1}{2} omega leq c < b ]  Step-by-step: 1. **Definition of segments and points:**    Let ( P ) denote the midpoint of ( AB ). The segment ( MP ) is a median in the triangle ( ABM ) and also serves as the mid-segment of ( ABC ). Consequently, ( MP ) has a length of ( frac{b}{2} ). 2. **Description of geometric loci:**    To construct the triangle:    - Take the segment ( AB = c ).    - The point ( M ) lies on the circumcircle of ( ABC ) that subtends an angle ( omega ) at ( A ).    - Additionally, ( M ) is at a distance ( frac{b}{2} ) from ( P ). 3. **Intersection of loci:**    ( M ) is determined as the intersection of:    - The circle centered at ( P ) with radius ( frac{b}{2} ).    - The circumcircle subtending an angle ( omega ) at ( A ).  4. **Construction validation:**    The correctness of the construction is apparent. The number of solutions corresponds to the number of intersections between the aforementioned loci, which could be 2, 1, or none. 5. **Triangle properties and inequalities:**    In triangles ( AMB ) and ( AMC ):    - The common side is ( MA ).    - We have ( MB = MC ) by definition of ( M ) being the midpoint.    - The angle ( angle AMB = omega ) is acute. Hence, ( ABC ) can correctly form a triangle only if:    [    c < b    ] 6. **Deriving the inequality with trigonometric considerations:**    Suppose ( O ) is the center of the circumcircle passing through ( A ) and ( B ):       - Given that ( PO geq PM = frac{b}{2} ).       - Because ( omega ) is acute, ( O ) lies on the same side of ( AB ) as ( i ) (the circumcircle).    Using the relationship between the central and peripheral angles:    [    angle POB = omega    ]    Hence,    [    PO = PB cot omega = frac{c}{2} cot omega    ]        Also, ( OM ):    [    OM = OB = frac{PB}{sin omega} = frac{c}{2 sin omega}    ]    Substituting these into the inequality:    [    frac{b}{2} leq frac{c}{2} left( cot omega + frac{1}{sin omega} right)    ]        Simplifying using trigonometric identities:    [    cot omega + frac{1}{sin omega} = frac{1 + cos omega}{sin omega} = frac{2 cos^2 frac{omega}{2}}{2 sin frac{omega}{2} cos frac{omega}{2}} = frac{cos frac{omega}{2}}{sin frac{omega}{2}}    ]    Thus:    [    frac{b}{2} leq frac{c}{2} cdot frac{1}{tan frac{omega}{2}} implies b leq frac{c}{tan frac{omega}{2}}    ]    which translates to:    [    b cdot tan frac{1}{2} omega leq c    ] 8. **Conditions for equality:**    The equality holds if ( P ) lies exactly on the circumcircle ( i ) or when points ( A ) and ( B ), being endpoints, are situated such that they satisfy the equality in the derived inequality.

To do this, we can divide 100000 by 111 and find the remainder. 100000 ÷ 111 = 900 (with a remainder of 100) Since we have a remainder, 100000 is not divisible by 111.

According to the given conditions, each weight differs from its neighbors by at most 5 grams, and the lighter weights are in order from left to right. 1. **Determine the Masses of All Weights:**    Since the weights are ordered by increasing mass, the masses of the weights from left to right will be:        [    m, , m - 5, , m - 10, , ldots, , m - 60    ]        There are 13 weights altogether, so:        [ m, , m - 5, , m - 10, , ldots, , m - 60 ]     2. **Calculate the Sum of the Masses:**        The total sum of these masses can be expressed as:        [    sum_{i=0}^{12} (m - 5i)    ]        This simplifies to:        [    sum_{i=0}^{12} m - 5 sum_{i=0}^{12} i    ]     3. **Simplify the Summation:**    Note that ( sum_{i=0}^{12} m = 13m ) since there are 13 terms each equal to ( m ) and ( sum_{i=0}^{12} i = frac{12 cdot 13}{2} = 78 ) since it represents the sum of the first 13 natural numbers.

Since the distances from A and B to the line are equal, we use the formula for the distance from a point to a line: For point A(-2, -1), the distance to line l is: frac{|(-2)k - (-1) - k(1)|}{sqrt{k^2 + 1}} = frac{|-2k + 1 - k|}{sqrt{k^2 + 1}} = frac{|-3k + 1|}{sqrt{k^2 + 1}} For point B(4, 5), the distance to line l is: frac{|4k - 5 - k(1)|}{sqrt{k^2 + 1}} = frac{|4k - 5 - k|}{sqrt{k^2 + 1}} = frac{|3k - 5|}{sqrt{k^2 + 1}} Equating the distances gives us: frac{|-3k + 1|}{sqrt{k^2 + 1}} = frac{|3k - 5|}{sqrt{k^2 + 1}} Since the denominators are the same, we just need to equate the numerators: |-3k + 1| = |3k - 5| Solving this absolute value equation can be done by considering two subcases: - Subcase 1: -3k + 1 = 3k - 5 which leads to 6k = 6 or k = 1. - Subcase 2: 3k - 1 = -3k + 5 which fails because 6k = 4 contradicts two points having equal distances to line l. The slope k = 1 is a valid solution, so the equation of line l is y = x - 1.

Therefore, we can calculate the sine of this angle using the Pythagorean identity: [ sin(alpha + frac{pi}{4}) = sqrt{1 - cos^2(alpha + frac{pi}{4})} = sqrt{1 - (-frac{3}{5})^2} = sqrt{1 - frac{9}{25}} = sqrt{frac{16}{25}} = frac{4}{5} ] Now, we need to find the ordinate (y-coordinate) of point P_1, which is sin(alpha). We can use the angle difference identity for sine to express sin(alpha) in terms of sin(alpha + frac{pi}{4}) and cos(alpha + frac{pi}{4}): [ sin(alpha) = sinleft[(alpha + frac{pi}{4}) - frac{pi}{4}right] = sin(alpha + frac{pi}{4})cos(frac{pi}{4}) - cos(alpha + frac{pi}{4})sin(frac{pi}{4}) ] Substituting the known values: [ sin(alpha) = frac{sqrt{2}}{2} left(frac{4}{5} + frac{3}{5}right) = frac{sqrt{2}}{2} cdot frac{7}{5} = frac{7sqrt{2}}{10} ] Therefore, the ordinate of point P_1, which is sin(alpha), is boxed{frac{7sqrt{2}}{10}}.

We claim that Isabel can pair these points such that each pair consists of one red point and one blue point, and the segments do not intersect. 3. **Proof by Induction:**    - **Base Case:**      For ( n = 2 ), we have 2 red points and 2 blue points. We can pair them as (Red, Blue) and (Red, Blue) without any intersections.        - **Inductive Step:**      Assume the claim holds for ( n = k ). Now consider ( n = k + 1 ). Walk around the circle and find a pair of adjacent points with different colors (one red and one blue). Such a pair always exists because there are equal numbers of red and blue points.

Place the labels such that the colors alternate when read clockwise around the circle: R, B, R, B, ... 3. **Proof:**    - Label the points ( A_1, A_2, ldots, A_{2n} ).    - Suppose ( A_1 ) is paired with ( A_k ). Then ( A_2, ldots, A_{k-1} ) must be paired within themselves.

Find a possible value of the perimeter of the paper.","output":"1. **Identify the problem and notable figures:**     - Let ABCD be the rectangular piece of paper with side lengths AB = a and BC = b.     - Here a leq b are integers as stated.     - The paper is folded such that a pair of diagonally opposite vertices coincide, meaning vertex B is exactly on vertex D.     - As a result, the crease formed, which we denote as PQ, has a length of 65 units. 2. **Diagram and relationships:**     - Let O be the center of the rectangle.     - Since PQ is the crease, PQ bisects the segment formed by a diagonal such that both sections on the crease are right triangles.     - This means PQ is the perpendicular bisector of BD.     - The length of the diagonal BD or AC = sqrt{a^2 + b^2} due to the Pythagorean theorem.     - Since PQ forms similar triangles with BC, BA (or DA), we know triangle BPO sim triangle DBC. 3. **Setting up the equations:**     - Let x be the length of the crease PQ. Thus, x = 65.     - Using similarity properties from triangle BPO sim triangle DBC, we derive:       [       frac{frac{1}{2} sqrt{a^2 + b^2}}{frac{1}{2}x} = frac{b}{a}       ]     - Rearranging and solving for x, we obtain:       [       x = frac{a}{b} sqrt{a^2 + b^2}       ]     - Given x = 65, substituting x gives:       [       65 = frac{a}{b} sqrt{a^2 + b^2}       ]     - Squaring both sides, we get:       [       65^2 = frac{a^2 (a^2 + b^2)}{b^2}       ]       [       4225 = frac{a^2 (a^2 + b^2)}{b^2}       ]     - Simplifying, we find:       [       4225 b^2 = a^2 (a^2 + b^2)       ]     - Re-arranging for b, we find:       [       b = frac{a^2}{sqrt{4225 - a^2}}       ]     - For b to be an integer, sqrt{4225 - a^2} must be an integer.  4. **Finding integer solutions:**     - We solve 4225 - a^2 = k^2 for integers a and k:       [       4225 = a^2 + k^2       ]     - Finding pairs (a, k) that work as integer solutions:       [       65^2 = (5 times 13)^2 + (12 times 13)^2       ]       We test several a values. 5. **Testing values and calculation of b:**     - We try values like (a = 63, 60, 52, 39, 33, 25, 16). 6. **Verification steps:**     - Only values that satisfy being integers with (b geq a) are valid.     - Through trial, we find that boxed{a = 60} yields b = 65.      7. **Calculate perimeter:**     - Once a and b are identified, the perimeter 2(a + b) is computed:       [       2(a + b) = 2(60 + 144) = 408       ] 8. **Conclusion:**    [    boxed{408}    ]"},{"instruction":"The Brazilian IMO leader chooses two natural numbers ( n ) and ( k ) with ( n > k ), and tells these numbers to his Deputy and a participant.

Daher muss der Teilnehmer mindestens 2 Mal raten, da er nicht entscheiden kann, welche der beiden Folgen die richtige ist. 6. **Eindeutigkeit der Lösung**:    - Um zu beweisen, dass es keine weitere Folge gibt, die die gleiche Liste erzeugen kann, rät der Teilnehmer (ohne Beschränkung der Allgemeinheit) die erste Stelle der Folge als 0.    - Daraufhin streicht er alle ( binom{n-1}{k} ) Folgen, die mit einer 1 beginnen, und streicht die 0 an der ersten Stelle bei allen anderen Folgen.    - Die verbleibenden Folgen sind solche der Länge ( n-1 ) mit ( k ) geänderten Einträgen.    - Da ( k neq frac{n-1}{2} ), ist die Lösung nach dieser Reduktion eindeutig feststellbar.

Since they are moving in opposite directions, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds. Let's denote the speed of the slower bus as ( v ) km/hr. The distance covered when the slower bus passes the driver of the faster bus is the sum of their lengths, which is ( 3125 text{ m} + 3125 text{ m} = 6250 text{ m} ). We need to convert this distance to kilometers because the speeds are given in km/hr. There are 1000 meters in a kilometer, so the distance in kilometers is ( frac{6250}{1000} = 6.25 text{ km} ). The time taken to cover this distance is 50 seconds. We need to convert this time to hours because the speeds are given in km/hr. There are 3600 seconds in an hour, so the time in hours is ( frac{50}{3600} text{ hours} ). Now, we can use the formula for relative speed: [ text{Relative speed} = frac{text{Distance}}{text{Time}} ] Plugging in the values we have: [ 40 + v = frac{6.25}{frac{50}{3600}} ] To solve for ( v ), we first simplify the right side of the equation: [ 40 + v = frac{6.25}{frac{50}{3600}} = 6.25 times frac{3600}{50} ] [ 40 + v = 6.25 times 72 ] [ 40 + v = 450 ] Now, we subtract 40 from both sides to solve for ( v ): [ v = 450 - 40 ] [ v = 410 ] So, the speed of the slower bus is boxed{410}  km/hr.

Since 2500 leaves a remainder of 7 when divided by 9, it follows that ( n, S(n), ) and ( S(S(n)) ) must all leave a remainder of 7 when divided by 9.

We need to prove that this set can be divided into three parts such that the diameter of each part does not exceed 1. 1. **Case 1: The diameter of ( S ) is at least ( sqrt{3} ).**    Let ( A ) and ( B ) be points in ( S ) such that ( AB geq sqrt{3} ). Consider the unit circles ( omega_A ) and ( omega_B ) centered at ( A ) and ( B ), respectively. Let ( omega ) denote the (closed) intersection of ( omega_A ) and ( omega_B ). Since ( AB geq sqrt{3} ), the region ( omega ) is either empty or has a diameter at most 1.    We claim that all points of ( S ) in ( omega_A setminus omega ) have a diameter at most 1. Suppose not, then there exist points ( P_1, P_2 in (omega_A setminus omega) cap S ) such that ( P_1P_2 > 1 ). This would mean that ( P_1, P_2, B ) form a set of three points where the distance between ( P_1 ) and ( P_2 ) exceeds 1, contradicting the given condition.    Similarly, the points in ( S cap (omega_B setminus omega) ) also have a diameter at most 1. Therefore, we can partition ( S ) into three parts: ( S cap (omega_A setminus omega) ), ( S cap (omega_B setminus omega) ), and ( S cap omega ), each with a diameter at most 1. 2. **Case 2: The diameter of ( S ) is at most ( sqrt{3} ).**    For any three points ( A, B, C ) in ( S ) such that ( AB, BC, CA leq sqrt{3} ), there exists a unit circle covering ( triangle ABC ). This can be shown by considering whether ( triangle ABC ) is acute or obtuse. If acute, the circumcircle of ( triangle ABC ) will suffice. If obtuse, the circle with the longest side of ( triangle ABC ) as its diameter will suffice.    By Helly's Theorem, the set of unit circles centered at the points in ( S ) all have a common point, say ( P ). This implies that the entire set ( S ) is contained within the unit circle centered at ( P ).    Let ( Q in S ) be the point furthest from ( P ), and let ( PQ = r leq 1 ). Let ( omega_P ) denote the circle centered at ( P ) with radius ( r ); note that ( S subset omega_P ). Let ( omega_Q ) denote the unit circle centered at ( Q ). The set of points in ( S ) contained in ( omega_P setminus omega_Q ) has a diameter at most 1, as otherwise, we would have a contradiction with two points being more than 1 unit apart from ( Q ).    Finally, the region ( omega_P cap omega_Q ) can be split into two sets of diameter at most 1 by bisecting it along the line ( PQ ). Thus, we can partition ( S ) into three parts, each with a diameter at most 1. Since we have covered all possible cases, the proof is complete.

To Prove: - If we can form a triangle with any three consecutive sticks. - We can also form a triangle using sticks of the same color. # Steps: 1. **Label the Sticks:**    Let's denote the 6 sticks as (a, b, c, d, e, f), and for simplicity, assume:    - (a, c,) and (e) are blue.    - (b, d,) and (f) are yellow. 2. **Length Representation:**    The lengths of the sticks are also denoted by the same letters: (a, b, c, d, e, f). 3. **Assume Arrangement:**    Suppose the largest blue stick is (a) and the largest yellow stick is adjacent to it, let that be (b). 4. **Condition for a Triangle using Alternating Sticks:**    By assumption, since alternating sticks form a valid triangle, we have:    [    d + c > b    ] 5. **Proof by Contradiction:**    Assume that we cannot form a triangle with all yellow sticks.        Thus, we would need:    [    b > d + f    ] 6. **Comparison of Stick Lengths:**    If (a) is the largest blue stick and the above inequality holds, (c > f).    Given that sticks alternate in colors and form triangles:    [    e + f > a    ]    and since (c > f):    [    e + c > a    ] 7. **Conclusion:**    From the above reasoning, (e) and (c) together exceed (a), satisfying the triangle inequality for blue sticks. Hence, we can form a triangle using the blue sticks.    To extend the argument:    Suppose the largest yellow stick does not lie adjacent to (a) but rather, let it be (d). Then the inequalities:    [    b + f > a    ]    and    [    a geq d    ]    lead us to the conclusion that the triangle inequalities for (b, f,) and (d) (yellow sticks) are satisfied:    [    b + f > d    ]    Therefore the triangle formation condition is met for the yellow sticks too:    [    b + f > d    ] Thus, we've shown both blue and yellow sticks can form triangles.

Find the maximum value of S = left| d_1 right| + left| d_2 right| + cdots + left| d_n right|.  Case 1: 4 mid n 1. We use the inequality left| d_k right| leqslant left| overrightarrow{OA_k} right| left| overrightarrow{A_{k-1}A_{k+1}} right|. 2. Since left| overrightarrow{OA_k} right| = 1 on the unit circle, we have:    [    left| d_k right| = left| overrightarrow{A_{k-1}A_{k+1}} right| leqslant 2    ] 3. Thus, S leqslant 2n. 4. To achieve this bound, consider a configuration where points A_1, A_3, A_5, ldots, A_{n-1} are coincident at point P and points A_2, A_4, A_6, ldots, A_n are coincident at point Q (Fig (a)). 5. In this configuration, each d_k = pm 2, hence:    [    S = 2n    ] 6. So for 4 mid n, ( S_{max} = 2n ).  Case 2: n is odd 1. Let a_k = overrightarrow{OA_{k-1}} cdot overrightarrow{OA_k} for k=1,2,ldots,n. 2. Then using properties of the dot product:    [    d_k = overrightarrow{OA_k} cdot left( overrightarrow{OA_{k+1}} - overrightarrow{OA_{k-1}} right) = a_{k+1} - a_k    ] 3. Since n is odd, there must exist some j in {1,2,ldots,n}, such that a_j - a_{j-1} and a_{j+1} - a_j are of opposite signs. 4. Assume a_1 - a_n and a_2 - a_1 are of opposite signs. Therefore:    [    S = left| a_1 - a_n right| + left| a_2 - a_1 right| + sum_{k=2}^{n-1} left| d_k right|    ] 5.

When x<-1, both (x-1) and (x+1) are negative, so we have f(x)=-(x-1)-(x+1)=-2x-2x+2=-4x+2. 2. When -1leqslant xleqslant 1, (x-1) is non-negative and (x+1) is non-negative, so we have f(x)=(x-1)+(x+1)=2x-1+x+1=3x. 3. When x>1, both (x-1) and (x+1) are positive, so we have f(x)=(x-1)+(x+1)=2x-1+x+1=2x+2. Now, let's analyze the inequality f(x)-aleqslant 0 for each case: 1. For x<-1, we have -4x+2-aleqslant 0, which simplifies to 4xgeqslant 2-a. Since x can be any value less than -1, we need to find the minimum value of 4x to ensure the inequality holds true.

Since x can be any value between -1 and 1, we need to find the maximum value of x to ensure the inequality holds true. This occurs when x=1, and we have 1leqslant frac{a}{3}, which simplifies to ageqslant 3. 3. For x>1, we have 2x+2-aleqslant 0, which simplifies to 2xleqslant a-2. Since x can be any value greater than 1, we need to find the minimum value of 2x to ensure the inequality holds true. This occurs when x=1, and we have 2(1)leqslant a-2, which simplifies to ageqslant 4. From the analysis above, we can see that the most restrictive condition on a is ageqslant 4.

Can the equation  p(x)=2  have two different integer solutions?","output":"1. Let ( p(x) ) be a polynomial with integer coefficients. Given that ( p(x) = 1 ) and ( p(x) = 3 ) have integer solutions, let ( a ) be an integer such that ( p(a) = 1 ) and ( b ) be an integer such that ( p(b) = 3 ). 2. Suppose ( p(x) = 2 ) has at least two distinct integer roots, say ( y_1 ) and ( y_2 ). This means ( p(y_1) = 2 ) and ( p(y_2) = 2 ) with ( y_1 neq y_2 ). 3. Consider the polynomial ( p(x) - 1 ). Since ( p(a) = 1 ), we have ( p(a) - 1 = 0 ). Therefore, ( a ) is a root of ( p(x) - 1 ). 4. Similarly, consider the polynomial ( p(x) - 3 ). Since ( p(b) = 3 ), we have ( p(b) - 3 = 0 ). Therefore, ( b ) is a root of ( p(x) - 3 ). 5. Now, consider the differences ( p(y_1) - p(a) ) and ( p(y_2) - p(a) ):    [    p(y_1) - p(a) = 2 - 1 = 1    ]    [    p(y_2) - p(a) = 2 - 1 = 1    ] 6.

Since ( p(x) ) has integer coefficients, the differences ( y_1 - a ), ( y_2 - a ), ( y_1 - b ), and ( y_2 - b ) must divide the differences in the polynomial values. Specifically:    [    y_1 - a mid 1 quad text{and} quad y_2 - a mid 1    ]    [    y_1 - b mid -1 quad text{and} quad y_2 - b mid -1    ] 8. The divisors of 1 and -1 are ( pm 1 ). Therefore, ( y_1 ) and ( y_2 ) must be within 1 unit of ( a ) and ( b ):    [    y_1 = a pm 1 quad text{and} quad y_2 = a pm 1    ]    [    y_1 = b pm 1 quad text{and} quad y_2 = b pm 1    ] 9. Since ( y_1 ) and ( y_2 ) are distinct, we must have:    [    y_1 = a + 1 quad text{and} quad y_2 = a - 1 quad text{or} quad y_1 = a - 1 quad text{and} quad y_2 = a + 1    ] 10.

However, this leads to a contradiction because ( a ) and ( b ) are distinct integers, and ( y_1 ) and ( y_2 ) cannot simultaneously satisfy both conditions for different ( a ) and ( b ). 12. Therefore, the assumption that ( p(x) = 2 ) has two distinct integer solutions leads to a contradiction.

This can be done in {C}_{5}^{2} ways. The combination formula is used here because the order in which we select the volunteers for the group does not matter. 3. **Calculating {C}_{5}^{2}**: The formula for combinations is {C}_{n}^{r} = frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!}. Applying this formula, we get {C}_{5}^{2} = frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = frac{5 times 4}{2 times 1} = 10 ways. 4. **Arranging the Groups**: After forming the first group, we are left with 4 groups (including the first group and the remaining 3 volunteers, each considered as a separate group). These 4 groups need to be assigned to the 4 projects. This can be done in {A}_{4}^{4} ways, where {A}_{n}^{r} = frac{n!}{(n-r)!}. Since r = n in this case, {A}_{4}^{4} = 4! = 4 times 3 times 2 times 1 = 24 ways. The arrangement formula is used here because the order in which we assign the groups to the projects matters. 5. **Calculating the Total Number of Ways**: To find the total number of allocation schemes, we multiply the number of ways to form the first group by the number of ways to arrange the groups among the projects.

Since A_i is an r-element subset of X, every element of A_i would either be all red or all black.     3. **Counting Possible Colorings:**        There are 2^n possible ways to color the set X, as each element in X can be either red or black independently. 4. **Bounding the Same Color Subsets:**    The expected number of r-element subsets A_i that are monochromatic (all red or all black) can be bounded.        Note that there are precisely 2 times 2^{n-1} = 2^n ways to color the set X such that a specific r-element subset A_i is monochromatic: either A_i is entirely red or entirely black.     5. **Using the Given Constraint:**        The provided constraint t leq 2^{-1} implies that t is very small, essentially tending to zero for large n.     6. **Ensuring Non-Monochromatic Sets:**        Given there are 2^n total coloring ways and each A_i would be counted twice in the monochromatic case (once for all red, once for all black), the probability of each A_i being monochromatic is extremely small. 7. **Conclusion Based on Coloring:**        Since there are 2^n ways to color the set X and not all colorings can ensure that all subsets A_i are monochromatic (due to the bound t leq 2^{-1} being strictly stringent), by the Pigeonhole Principle, there must exist a coloring in which each A_i is not monochromatic.

To solve this, let's follow these detailed steps: 1. **Starting Assumption**:    Assume there exists an appropriate point (P) inside the quadrilateral such that the areas of triangles (ABP), (BCP), (CDP), and (DAP) are all equal. This implies:    [    t_{ABP} = t_{BCP} = t_{CDP} = t_{DAP}    ] 2. **Equal Areas and Distance Properties**:    From ( t_{ABP} = t_{DAP} ), it follows that the line (AP) is equidistant from points (B) and (D). Hence, line (AP) bisects the diagonal (BD), such that (AP) intersects the midpoint of (BD). This also implies:    [    BM_1 = DM_2    ]    Therefore, the right-angle triangles (BM_1F) and (DM_2F) are congruent, indicating that:    [    BF = DF    ]    Hence, (AP) bisects the diagonal (BD).    Similarly, from ( t_{BCP} = t_{CDP} ), the line (CP) also bisects diagonal (BD). 3. **Intersection Point of (AP) and (CP)**:    Assuming (AP) and (CP) intersect at a single point, this point must be the midpoint of diagonal (BD). Therefore, point (P) is the midpoint of (BD). 4. **Distances to Midpoint**:    Due to the equal area criteria ( t_{ABP} = t_{BCP} ) and ( t_{ADP} = t_{CDP} ), the lines (BP) and (DP) are equidistant from points (A) and (C) respectively. Since (B), (P), and (D) are collinear, the line (BD) must be equidistant from (A) and (C), which implies that (BD) bisects segment (AC). 5. **Conclusion for Diagonal Bisectors**:    Therefore, if there exists a point (P) such that all four triangle areas are equal, then one of the quadrilateral's diagonals must bisect the other. 6. **Reverse Situation**:    Conversely, if one diagonal bisects the other in the quadrilateral, we can use the midpoint of the non-bisected diagonal as (P), ensuring the triangles (ABP), (BCP), (CDP), and (DAP) have equal areas. Due to the equal segments and heights, the quadrilateral satisfied the equal area condition (as described using Figure 2). 7. **Proof Through Trigonometry**:    Considering the trigonometric identities for the sine of the angles involved, we have:    [    ab sin alpha = bc sin beta = cd sin gamma = da sin delta    ]    [    sin alpha sin gamma = sin beta sin delta    ]    By using product-to-sum formulas of sines, we obtain:    [    sin alpha sin gamma = frac{cos(alpha - gamma) - cos(alpha + gamma)}{2}    ]    [    sin beta sin delta = frac{cos(beta - delta) - cos(beta + delta)}{2}    ]    Therefore:    [    frac{sin alpha sin gamma}{sin beta sin delta} = frac{cos (alpha - gamma) - cos (alpha + gamma)}{cos (beta - delta) - cos (beta + delta)} = 1    ]    Knowing that (alpha + beta + gamma + delta = 360^circ), we derive:    [    cos (alpha + gamma) = cos (beta + delta)    ]    Since (cos (x)) is an even function:    [    cos (alpha - gamma) = cos (beta - delta)    ]    Hence:    [    alpha - gamma = beta - delta quad text{or} quad alpha - gamma = delta - beta    ]    Assume (alpha - gamma = beta - delta), this returns:    [    alpha + delta = beta + gamma = 180^circ    ]    Events we computed induce the conclusion as inspected in Figure 4. This means:    [    P = text{midpoint of diagonal (BD)}    ] 8. **Final Conclusion**:    The condition is met by those convex quadrilaterals in which one diagonal bisects the other, with (P) being the midpoint of the diagonals.

We are given that: 1. The batsman's batting average is 62 runs, so ( T = 62n ). 2. The difference between his highest and lowest score is 150 runs, so ( H - L = 150 ). 3. His average excluding the two innings with the highest and lowest scores is 58 runs. If we remove these two innings, the number of innings becomes ( n - 2 ), and the total runs scored in these innings is ( T - H - L ). Therefore, the average for these innings is ( frac{T - H - L}{n - 2} = 58 ). 4. His highest score is 225 runs, so ( H = 225 ). Now, let's use these equations to find the number of innings ( n ). From equation 2, we know that ( L = H - 150 ), so ( L = 225 - 150 = 75 ). From equation 3, we can express the total runs scored in the ( n - 2 ) innings as: ( T - H - L = 58(n - 2) ). Substituting ( T = 62n ), ( H = 225 ), and ( L = 75 ) into the equation, we get: ( 62n - 225 - 75 = 58(n - 2) ). Simplifying the equation: ( 62n - 300 = 58n - 116 ).

Consider a tetrahedron ABCD. We denote the midpoint of edge AB as E and the midpoint of edge CD as G, hence E and G connect two opposite edges of the tetrahedron. 2. Examine the plane passing through points E and G. This plane is called the plane CEG. We first show that this plane divides the tetrahedron into two equal-volume parts. 3. Since E is the midpoint of AB, and G is the midpoint of CD, lines CE and EG cut triangles ABC and BCD into two equal areas respectively.  4. The tetrahedron AECD and EBCD have the same base area when considering triangles AEC and BEC. Furthermore, they also share the same height from vertex D perpendicular to the base plane ABC. 5.

Now, let’s consider a rotation of the plane CEG around the line EG. This plane intersects the tetrahedron along a quadrilateral EFGH. We next argue that the rotated plane will also divide the tetrahedron into two parts of equal volume. 7. To illustrate this, focus on tetrahedron EBCD. Rotating the plane CEG yields a new plane slicing off pyramid EGHD and adding pyramid EGFC to EBCD instead.  8. By construction and symmetry around EG, triangle EGH is congruent to triangle EGF because points F and H are equidistant from the line EG. Thus, the areas of these triangles are equal. 9. Since G is the midpoint of CD, both C and D are at equal distances from the plane EFGH, ensuring that the heights of the pyramids EGHD and EGFC are the same. 10. Consequently, the volumes of pyramids EGHD and EGFC are equal, which implies that the rotated plane also divides the tetrahedron into two regions of equal volume. 11. To observe dynamically, as the plane rotates around GE, point F moves along the segment CA towards A. When F coincides with A, the rotating plane becomes ABG, lying on the original plane. 12. Continuing rotations around GE will further repeat the conditions described, ensuring that all intermediate planes formed during the rotation divide the tetrahedron into equal volumes. # Conclusion: Thus, any plane passing through the midpoints of two opposite edges of a tetrahedron always divides the tetrahedron into two equal volumes.

(3) Now we have a system of equations (1), (2), and (3). We can solve for 'a' and 'b' by using equations (1) and (2) to find 'a', and then use that value of 'a' to find 'b'. Subtract equation (1) from equation (2) to eliminate 'b': (4a + b) - (a + b) = 9 - 4 4a - a = 5 3a = 5 a = 5/3 Now that we have the value of 'a', we can substitute it back into equation (1) to find 'b': 4 = (5/3) * 1 + b 4 = 5/3 + b b = 4 - 5/3 b = 12/3 - 5/3 b = 7/3 So, 'a' is 5/3 and 'b' is 7/3. Now, to find out how many cans Zachary will find on the seventh day (d = 7), we use the formula with the values of 'a' and 'b' we just found: c = a * d^2 + b c = (5/3) * 7^2 + (7/3) c = (5/3) * 49 + (7/3) c = (5 * 49)/3 + 7/3 c = 245/3 + 7/3 c = (245 + 7)/3 c = 252/3 c = 84 Zachary will find boxed{84}  cans on the seventh day."},{"instruction":"The price of an article was decreased by a certain percentage, and now it costs Rs. 532.

For the remaining poles, we only need to consider the additional time it takes to travel the distances between the poles, as the time to cross each pole itself is negligible compared to the distances between them.

Under this transformation, let's determine the images of specific points on the triangle.     2. **Mapping Points via Homothety:**    - The circumcenter O of triangle ABC will remain O since it is the center of the homothety.    - The midpoint D of side BC will map to the point D' on Omega. This point D' is such that it is on the extension of OD and is twice as far from O as D.    - The points F and E, where the bisectors of the internal and external angles at vertex A intersect BC, will map to F' and E' respectively.

By the properties of the homothety, point M maps to a point M' on Omega. Specifically, M' is the point where the homothety image of M lands, ensuring OM' = 2 cdot OM.    - Note that M' lies on Omega in such a way that OM' is exactly the diameter of Omega through M since M' is twice the distance from O as M and diametrically opposite to M. 4. **Intersection and Perpendicularity:**    - Considering the intersection points F' and E' for the bisectors and their equivalent mappings, we ensure these are correctly mapped through O under homothety, maintaining the perpendicularity property. 5. **Summarizing the Conclusion:**    The line through the image of the midpoint D' under the homothety bisects the segment. This segment connects the midpoints M and N (midpoints of sides AB and AC). It is crucial to observe that diameters in circles always pass through the center, ensuring that OM' bisects segments correctly by passing through midpoint M and respective homothetic points symmetrically. 6. **Finalizing Statement:**    Thus, we have established that the described line indeed bisects the specific segment as required, confirming the geometric properties preserved under homothety. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"Kim has 4 cousins.

Since AB is not a bridge, B must have some other neighbor in R on the other side from A, say E. Then, we must have some other path from A to E that is not through B. In that case, the path either goes around C or around D. Whichever one it goes around must be in R because R is simply connected. blacksquare    **Lemma 2:** operatorname{diam} G leq k-2.    *Proof:* We strong induce on k. If k = 2, then R is a unit square and so G is a single vertex.    If G is a bridge, then R can be split into R_1, R_2 with perimeters P_1, P_2 and adjacency graphs G_1, G_2. Then,    [    operatorname{diam} G leq operatorname{diam} G_1 + operatorname{diam} G_2 + 1 leq frac{P_1}{2} - 2 + frac{P_2}{2} - 2 + 1 = frac{P+2}{2} - 3 = k-2    ]    indeed.    Else, note that when we walk around the perimeter of R, we will have two consecutive 90 degree turns.

We claim now that the grid squares T_1, ldots, T_m are all in R. For 1 leq i leq m-1, T_i in R follows from Lemma 1 since S_i, S_{i+1} are both in R but the square above S_i is not. For i = m, note that S_{m-1}, S_m are in R but the square above S_m is not. Thus, if R' is R with the S_i's removed, then R' is still a snorlax. Furthermore, R''s perimeter is 2(k-1). Finally, if R' has adjacency graph G', then    [    begin{aligned}    operatorname{diam} G &= maxleft(operatorname{diam} G', m-1, max_{substack{v in G'  1 leq i leq m}} d(v, S_i)right)     &leq maxleft(operatorname{diam} G', m-1, max_{substack{v in G'  1 leq i leq m}} d(v, T_i) + 1right)     &leq maxleft(operatorname{diam} G', m-1, operatorname{diam} G' + 1right)     &= operatorname{diam} G' + 1    end{aligned}    ]    where we note that operatorname{diam} G' geq m-1 since d(T_1, T_m) = m-1. Thus,    [    operatorname{diam} G leq operatorname{diam} G' + 1 leq k-3 + 1 = k-2,    ]    and the induction is complete. blacksquare    Now, suppose alpha = 2 and Po just floods O = (0,0) initially. Let S_t be the set of squares flooded on the t-th turn. Then, d(O, A) = t (as vertices of G) for any A in S_t. In particular, suppose you win on your n-th turn. Then, the enclosed region R has perimeter at most 2n. Furthermore,    [    R supset S_0 cup S_1 cup cdots cup S_{n-1},    ]    and S_{n-1} is nonempty. So, operatorname{diam} G geq n-1 since d(O, A) = n-1 for A in S_{n-1}, while R's perimeter is at most 2n, contradicting Lemma 2. Thus, you cannot win in finitely many turns. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"The difference between the compound interest payable half yearly and the simple interest on a certain sum lent out at 10% per annum for 1 year is Rs 25.

Therefore, f(x) attains a minimum value at x=1, which contradicts the problem statement. For the case a=-6, b=9: f'(x)=3x^{2}-12x+9=3(x-1)(x-3). Here, f'(x)>0 when x<1, and f'(x)<0 when 1<x<3. Thus, f(x) attains a maximum value at x=1, which is consistent with the given information. Hence, frac{b}{a}=-frac{9}{-6}=boxed{-frac{3}{2}}.

This is because the direction of the normal vector determines the orientation of the plane. Therefore, if two normal vectors are parallel, their corresponding planes do not intersect and are parallel to each other. 2. **Statement ②**: overrightarrow{n_1} is perpendicular to overrightarrow{n_2} Leftrightarrow alpha is perpendicular to beta. - Similar to the reasoning for statement ①, if the normal vectors of two planes are perpendicular to each other, it means the planes are oriented at a right angle to each other, making the planes perpendicular. This is because the angle between planes is defined by the angle between their normal vectors. 3. **Statement ③**: overrightarrow{v} is parallel to overrightarrow{n_1} Leftrightarrow l is parallel to alpha. - This statement is incorrect because if the direction vector of a line is parallel to the normal vector of a plane, it actually means the line is perpendicular to the plane. The normal vector of a plane is perpendicular to any vector lying on the plane, so if a line's direction vector is parallel to the normal vector, the line itself must be perpendicular to the plane. 4. **Statement ④**: overrightarrow{v} is perpendicular to overrightarrow{n_1} Leftrightarrow l is perpendicular to alpha. - This statement is also incorrect because if the direction vector of a line is perpendicular to the normal vector of a plane, it means the line lies within or is parallel to the plane, not perpendicular to it. A line is perpendicular to a plane if its direction vector is parallel to the plane's normal vector.

The formula for simple interest is: Interest (I) = Principal (P) × Rate (R) × Time (T) / 100 We know that the interest earned is 1/6 of the principal, so we can write: P/6 = P × R × 4 / 100 Now, we can solve for R: R × 4 = 100 / 6 R = (100 / 6) / 4 R = 100 / 24 R = 4.1667 (approximately) So, the rate of simple interest per annum is approximately boxed{4.17%} ."},{"instruction":"Let S<sub>n</sub> be the sum of the first n terms of the arithmetic sequence {a<sub>n</sub>}, with a<sub>3</sub> = 3 and S<sub>7</sub> = 14.

The roots of this quadratic equation, denoted as ( r_1 ) and ( r_2 ), are given by:    [    r_1, r_2 = frac{-6 pm sqrt{6^2 - 4 cdot 1 cdot c}}{2 cdot 1} = frac{-6 pm sqrt{36 - 4c}}{2}    ]    [    r_1, r_2 = -3 pm sqrt{9 - c}    ]    We assume for there to be distinct roots, the term under the square root must be non-negative (i.e., ( 9 - c geq 0 )), ensuring that ( c leq 9 ). 2. **Conditions for ( f(f(x)) ) to have exactly 3 distinct real roots:**    For ( f(f(x)) ) to have exactly 3 distinct roots, the function ( f(x) = x^2 + 6x + c ) should have two distinct real roots, say ( r_1 neq r_2 ). Without loss of generality, assume the situation where ( f(x) = r_1 ) has a double root, and ( f(x) = r_2 ) has a single root. 3. **Considering the Double Root Case:**    Assume ( r_1 ) to be a double root. Then ( f(x) = x^2 + 6x + c = r_1 ).    [    x^2 + 6x + c - r_1 = 0    ]    For this equation to have a double root, its discriminant must be zero:    [    Delta = 6^2 - 4 cdot 1 cdot (c - r_1) = 0    ]    [    36 - 4(c - r_1) = 0     ]    [    36 = 4(c - r_1)    ]    [    c - r_1 = 9     ]    [    r_1 = c - 9    ] 4. **Substitute ( r_1 ) Back into the Original Quadratic:**    ( r_1 = c - 9 ) is a root of ( f(x) = x^2 + 6x + c ), so:    [    (c - 9)^2 + 6(c - 9) + c = 0    ]    [    c^2 - 18c + 81 + 6c - 54 + c = 0    ]    [    c^2 - 11c + 27 = 0    ]    Solving this quadratic:    [    c = frac{11 pm sqrt{11^2 - 4 cdot 1 cdot 27}}{2 cdot 1}    ]    [    c = frac{11 pm sqrt{121 - 108}}{2}    ]    [    c = frac{11 pm sqrt{13}}{2}    ] 5. **Analyzing Whether Both Values of ( c ) Provide Exactly 3 Distinct Real Roots for ( f(f(x)) ):**    - If ( c = frac{11 - sqrt{13}}{2} ):      [      f(x) = x^2 + 6x + frac{11 - sqrt{13}}{2}      ]      The roots of this polynomial are ( x = -3 left( text{double root} right) ) and one distinct root given that ( f(x) = c-9 ).    - If ( c = frac{11 + sqrt{13}}{2} ):      [      f(x) = x^2 + 6x + frac{11 + sqrt{13}}{2}      ]      This does not fit the condition where ( f(x) = r_1 ) and ( f(x) = r_2 ) have the expected double and single root conditions.

Let's break down the steps involved: 1. **Understanding the Function ( S(m) ):**    We start by noting that:     leftlfloor frac{m}{k} rightrfloor     represents the largest integer less than or equal to ( frac{m}{k} ).    Summing these floor functions from ( k = 1 ) to ( k = m ) gives us ( S(m). ) 2. **Behavior of ( S(m) ):**    It’s known that ( S(m) ) can be approximated by the harmonic series:     S(m) approx m log m     but we need a more precise approximation. More precisely, we have:     S(m) = sum_{k=1}^{m} leftlfloor frac{m}{k} rightrfloor = m left(log m + gamma - 1right),     where ( gamma ) is the Euler-Mascheroni constant. 3. **Relating ( S(m) = n^2 + a ):**    We need to examine when:     n^2 + a = sum_{k=1}^{m} leftlfloor frac{m}{k} rightrfloor     We rewrite the equation:     S(m) - a = n^2  4. **Finding Pairs ((m, n)) Satisfying the Equation:**    To analyze this, we need to determine the behavior and range of values that ( S(m) ) can take. As mentioned earlier, ( S(m) ) tends to grow like ( m log m ), hence ( S(m) ) is strictly increasing as ( m ) increases. 5. **Checking if More Than ( 10^6 ) Solutions Exist:**    For large ( m ):     S(m+1) - S(m) approx log m + gamma     which is positive. Therefore, ( S(m) ) can take arbitrarily large values. 6. **Resulting Number of Solutions:**    If we consider ( n = k sqrt{S(m) - a} ), then there are many potential values for ( m ) and ( n ). For a fixed ( a ), you can find various pairs ((m, n)) that satisfy this equation. The key point is that ( S(m) ) can be tuned by choosing appropriate ( m ) to yield ( S(m) = n^2 + a ). Conclusion:    Since ( S(m) to infty ) as ( m to infty ), and given the structure of ( S(m) ), there exist many integer pairs ((m, n)) for which ( S(m) - a = n^2 ).

Given: a : b = 3 : 4 b : c = 7 : 9 c : d = 5 : 7 First, we need to make sure that the common terms in each ratio (b in the first two ratios and c in the last two ratios) are the same so that we can multiply the ratios directly. To do this, we find a common multiple for b in the first two ratios and for c in the last two ratios. For b, the common multiple of 4 (from a:b) and 7 (from b:c) is 28 (since 4 * 7 = 28). For c, the common multiple of 9 (from b:c) and 5 (from c:d) is 45 (since 9 * 5 = 45). Now we adjust the ratios to have these common multiples: For a:b, we multiply both terms by 7 to get the b term to be 28: a : b = 3*7 : 4*7 = 21 : 28 For b:c, we multiply both terms by 4 to get the b term to be 28 and the c term to be 45: b : c = 7*4 : 9*4 = 28 : 36 For c:d, we multiply both terms by 9 to get the c term to be 45: c : d = 5*9 : 7*9 = 45 : 63 Now we have: a : b = 21 : 28 b : c = 28 : 36 c : d = 45 : 63 We can now multiply these ratios together to find the ratio of a to d: a : b : c : d = 21 : 28 : 36 : 63 To find the ratio of a to d, we take the first and last terms: a : d = 21 : 63 This ratio can be simplified by dividing both terms by their greatest common divisor, which is 21: a : d = 21/21 : 63/21 = 1 : 3 Therefore, the ratio of a to d is boxed{1}  : 3."},{"instruction":"The imaginary part of frac{2+i}{12i} is ( ).

Let’s analyze this step by step. 1. **Petya's First Move:**     - Let Petya set the constant term (free term) of the equation to zero. This will make the modified equation:       [       x^3 + ax^2 + bx = 0.       ]       Setting the constant term to zero ensures that one root of the equation is (0). 2. **Vasya's Move:**     - Next, Vasya will modify either the (a) or (b) coefficient.

Let's denote these roots by (r_1) and (r_2), with (r_2 = r_1 + 2014). 4. **Setting the Coefficients:**     - By Vieta's formulas for (x^2 + ax + c = 0), the sum of roots (r_1) and (r_2) is equal to (-a). Therefore:       [       r_1 + r_2 = -a implies r_1 + (r_1 + 2014) = -a implies 2r_1 + 2014 = -a implies a = -(2r_1 + 2014).       ]     - The product of roots (r_1) and (r_2) is equal to (c). Therefore:       [       r_1 cdot r_2 = c implies r_1 cdot (r_1 + 2014) = c implies r_1^2 + 2014r_1 = c.       ]     - Petya can always choose (a) and (c) to be rational (since (r_1) is rational by choosing (r_1) appropriately), ensuring that the roots (0, (r_1), and (r_1 + 2014)) meet the condition. 5. **Alternative Approach:**     - Consider Petya assigns (x = -t^2) first where (t = 1007). This modifies the equation to:       [       x^3 + ax^2 - 1007^2 x + c = 0.       ]     - Depending on Vasya’s move, Petya can then fix the remaining term to:       [       c = -at^2 = -a(1007^2).       ] In both methods, the careful assignment of rational numbers as coefficients ensures the difference between the non-zero roots equals 2014.

According to the problem statement, 10% of people possess at least 90% of the world's money. Therefore, at least 90S money is owned by 10N people. We will refer to this group as \\"oligarchs.\\" 4.

Therefore, the expression reduces to:  x_0 + 11x_1 + 11x_{10} + x_{11} mod 4   x_0 + 3x_1 + 3x_{10} + x_{11} mod 4   x_0 - x_1 - x_{10} + x_{11} mod 4  We need x_0 - x_1 - x_{10} + x_{11} equiv 0 mod 4. Each x_i can be 0 or 1, so we consider all combinations of x_0, x_1, x_{10}, x_{11} such that their algebraic sum equals 0 mod 4. Possible combinations are all zeros or two ones and two zeros in any arrangement, giving {4choose2} + {4choose0} = 6 + 1 = 7 combinations. For x_2, ldots, x_9, they can be either 0 or 1, giving 2^8 possibilities.

How many sequences will he have to write out?","output":"Given the problem, we want to find the total number of sequences of length 100 composed of natural numbers, where each sequence contains at least one occurrence of the number 3, and every two adjacent elements differ by at most 1.  1. Understanding the number of possible sequences: Firstly, let's denote a sequence of ( n ) natural numbers as ( a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n ). Each two consecutive numbers within the sequence differ by at most 1. This condition on the sequence elements implies that the difference sequence ( b_i = a_{i+1} - a_i ) can only take values from the set ({-1, 0, 1}) for ( 1 leq i leq n-1 ). Thus, the total number of such difference sequences of length ( n-1 ) is ( 3^{n-1} ) (since each of ( n-1 ) differences can be (-1, 0), or ( 1)).  2. Counting the sequences that meet requirements: To find the desired sequences that include the number 3 at least once, we need to exclude those that do not include the number 3.  3. Exclusion of sequences not containing the number 3: If a sequence does not contain the number 3, then all its elements must either be all less than 3 or all greater than 3, since they can only differ by at most 1. Sequences made from numbers all less than 3 (using 1 and 2) can be calculated by considering sequences formed from just two numbers: - These sequences of length ( n ) (formed from 1 and 2 only) amount to ( 2^n ), as each position in the sequence can independently be either 1 or 2.  4. Combining the results: As derived above, the number of sequences of length ( n ) containing elements less than or equal to 3 is ( 3^{n-1} ). Consequently, the number of sequences containing at least one 3 is given by subtracting the number of sequences composed of only 1 and 2 from the total. Therefore, the total number of valid sequences is ( 3^n - 2^n ).  5. Specific Calculation for ( n = 100 ): Plugging in ( n = 100 ), [ S = 3^{100} ] and the number of sequences with numbers only 1 and 2 is  [ 2^{100} ]. Thus, the number of sequences of length 100 that include at least one 3 and where each two adjacent elements differ by at most 1 is: [ S - 2^{100} = 3^{100} - 2^{100} ] # Conclusion: The number of sequences satisfying the given criteria is  [ boxed{3^{100} - 2^{100}}. ]"},{"instruction":"Among the following functions, the graph of which passes through the fixed point (1,0) is (quad).

Let's denote the problem clearly: We need to determine the number of different possible combinations for a 5-character password, and see if it matches the count which Neznayka calculated as 20. 2. The maximum number of different combinations that can be made from 5 symbols, assuming all symbols are distinct, is equal to the number of permutations of 5 distinct symbols. This can be computed using the factorial function.    The factorial of a number n, denoted as n!, is given by:    [    n! = n times (n-1) times (n-2) times cdots times 1    ]    So,    [    5! = 5 times 4 times 3 times 2 times 1 = 120    ] 3. If there are repeated symbols, the number of unique permutations where the repetition occurs needs to be divided by the factorial of the count of each repeated group of symbols.

Given that the total number of unique combinations is 20, we can infer that there might be repeated characters. We need to find ( k ) for which the equation:    [    frac{5!}{k!} = 20    ]    holds true for some integer ( k ). 5. Solve the equation to find ( k ):    - We know ( 5! = 120 ), thus:    [    frac{120}{k!} = 20    ]    - Simplifying this, we get:    [    k! = frac{120}{20} = 6    ]    - The value of ( k ) that satisfies ( k! = 6 ) is:    [    k = 3 quad text{since} quad 3! = 3 times 2 times 1 = 6    ] Therefore, the configuration of symbols that fits this scenario is that there are 3 identical symbols of one type and the other two symbols are unique.

The squares are then stacked, and we are asked whether the sum of the numbers in each of the four corners of the stack can equal 2004 or 2005. Let's analyze both parts of the problem.  Part (a): Can the sum in each corner equal 2004? 1. **Sum Analysis**:    The sum of the numbers on a single square is:    [    1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10    ]     2. **Total Sum Calculation**:    If the sum of the numbers at each of the four corners of the stack is 2004, then the total sum of all numbers present in these corners must be:    [    4 times 2004 = 8016    ] 3. **Sum Requirement**:    For the total sum of the numbers to be valid, it must be a multiple of 10 because the sum of numbers on each square is 10. Let's check:    [    8016 div 10 neq 0 quad (text{division leaves a remainder})    ] 4. **Conclusion**:    Since 8016 is not divisible by 10, it is not possible for the sum in each corner to be 2004. [ boxed{2004} ]  Part (b): Can the sum in each corner equal 2005? 1. **Sum in Each Corner**:    If the sum in each corner is 2005, then the total sum of all numbers in the four corners of the stack is:    [    4 times 2005 = 8020    ] 2. **Sum Requirement**:    The total sum 8020 is analyzed similarly:    [    8020 div 10 = 802    ]    This means 8020 is divisible by 10, which is consistent with the requirement for the sum of numbers on each square to be valid. 3. **Constructing the Stack**:    Consider 401 pairs of squares, each pair consisting of one square with numbers (1, 2, 3, 4) and another with numbers (4, 3, 2, 1). When these pairs are combined (stacked), each corner will sum up as follows:    [    (1+4), (2+3), (3+2), (4+1) = 5 quad (text{for each pair})    ]    Thus, for 401 such pairs:    [    401 times 5 = 2005 quad (text{in each corner})    ] 4. **Conclusion**:    It is possible to arrange the squares such that the sum in each corner of the stack is 2005.

Let ( S ) be the set of points that belong to at least two circles. Show that ( |S| geq n ).","output":"1. **Graph Construction**: Construct a bipartite graph G = (X, Y, E), where X is the set of circles, Y = S is the set of points that belong to at least two circles, and E is the set of edges such that an edge (x, y) in E if and only if the point y lies on the circle x. 2. **Definitions and Initial Count**:    - |S| represents the number of points in Y.    - We start with the sum of the counts of each point in Y.        [    |S| = sum_{y in Y} 1    ] 3. **Double Counting Edges**:    - Count the edges in two different ways. First, by summing over the degrees of the points:    [    |S| = sum_{(x, y), x sim y} frac{1}{d_{y}}    ]    Here, d_y is the degree of vertex y, i.e., the number of circles that pass through the point y. 4. **Using Degree Relationships**:    - As each point y in Y lies on at least two circles, it must be in the intersection of these circles. Therefore, the degree d_y for such a point y must be at least 2.    - Given that the union of the circles is connected, each circle x must intersect with at least another circle, hence the degree of circle x, noted as d_x, gives the total number of distinct points shared between circle x and other circles.    - Consider the relationship:     [    d_{x} geq d_{y}    ]    This simplifies our counting since each circle contributes at least once for each shared point. 5. **Re-arranging the Summations**:    - By re-arranging the summation from individual points to the circles, we get:    [    sum_{(x, y), x sim y} frac{1}{d_{y}} geq sum_{(x, y), x sim y} frac{1}{d_{x}}    ]    Since sum_{y in Y} frac{1}{d_y} counts each edge weighed by the reciprocal of the degree of the point, and sum_{x in X} frac{1}{d_x} counts each edge weighted by the reciprocal of the degree of the circle, the inequality holds because each circle intersects other circles at exactly distinct points. 6. **Summing Over Circles**:    - This leads to:        [    sum_{(x, y), x sim y} frac{1}{d_{x}} = sum_{x in X} 1 = n    ]    This result follows because each circle x in X contributes to at least one intersection. 7. **Conclusion**:    - Combining the inequalities, we have:    [    |S| = sum_{y in Y} 1 geq sum_{(x, y), x sim y} frac{1}{d_{y}} geq sum_{x in X} 1 = n    ] Thus, the inequality |S| geq n is verified.

This symmetry implies that the behavior of the function on the negative side of the x-axis mirrors its behavior on the positive side. 2. **Increasing on left(-infty ,0right]**: This means that as x moves from left to right, reaching up to 0, the function f(x) increases. Consequently, due to the even function property, f(x) will decrease as x moves from 0 to positive infinity because the function must mirror its behavior on the negative side. Given the inequality fleft(aright)leqslant fleft(2right), we can leverage the properties above to understand the implications for a. Since the function is decreasing on [0,+infty) due to its even nature and the fact it's increasing on left(-infty ,0right], we can interpret this inequality under the mirror principle of even functions. - **Considering the even function property and the function's decreasing behavior on [0,+infty)**, the inequality fleft(aright)leqslant fleft(2right) implies that fleft(|a|right)leqslant fleft(2right). This is because, for any a in the domain, looking at |a| considers both the mirrored side (if a is negative) and the actual value (if a is positive). - **Translating Inequality to Domain Range**: The condition fleft(|a|right)leqslant fleft(2right) under the function's behavior implies |a| geqslant 2. This is because, as the function is decreasing on the positive side past 0, a larger |a| means a is either far to the left (negative) or far to the right (positive) of the axis to satisfy the inequality under the function's behavior. - **Determining the Range of a**: The inequality |a| geqslant 2 simplifies to two conditions: a leqslant -2 or a geqslant 2. This covers both sides of the axis, respecting the even function's symmetry and the inequality given.

How many empty boxes are needed to transfer all the cards to another box? The response follows from the general fact: let the number of cards be ( n ), where ( 2^{k-1} leq n < 2^k ) (for natural numbers ( n ) and ( k )); then ( k ) empty boxes are required.

In the end, all cards are transferred to box ( k+1 ), and the initial box no longer needs to be used once it's emptied. 4. **For ( 2^k < n < 2^{k+1} )**:     - First, move ( 2^k ) cards to box ( k+1 ), using boxes ( 1, ldots, k+1 ).     - The remaining ( n - 2^k < 2^k ) cards, by the inductive hypothesis, can be moved to box ( k ), using boxes ( 1, ldots, k ).     - Finally, reverse the \\"top\\" cards back, substituting the initial box with the ( k )-th one.

According to the problem, we have two pieces of information: 1. Each set of type A souvenirs costs 20 yuan more than each set of type B souvenirs, which gives us the equation x = y + 20. 2. One set of type A souvenirs and two sets of type B souvenirs together cost 200 yuan, leading to the equation x + 2y = 200. We can solve this system of equations as follows: - From the first equation, we have x = y + 20. - Substituting x from the first equation into the second equation, we get (y + 20) + 2y = 200. - Simplifying the equation, we find 3y + 20 = 200. - Solving for y, we get 3y = 180, so y = 60. - Substituting y = 60 back into the first equation, we find x = 60 + 20 = 80.

The maximum selling price for type A souvenirs, considering the 50% profit margin, is 80 times (1 + 50%) = 120 yuan. The range of values for n is 80 leqslant n leqslant 120. The total profit from selling type A souvenirs, denoted as w, can be calculated as w = m(n - 80) = (-frac{1}{2}n + 90)(n - 80). Simplifying this expression, we get w = -frac{1}{2}(n - 130)^2 + 1250. Since the coefficient of the quadratic term is negative, the graph of this function is a downward-opening parabola, which means the maximum value of w occurs at the vertex of the parabola. Given the range 80 leqslant n leqslant 120, the maximum profit occurs at the upper limit of this range, which is when n = 120. Substituting n = 120 into the expression for w, we find: w = -frac{1}{2} times (120 - 130)^2 + 1250 = -frac{1}{2} times 100 + 1250 = 1200. boxed{text{When n is 120 yuan, the total profit from selling type A souvenirs is maximized, and the maximum profit is 1200 yuan.}}"},{"instruction":"Given the function f(x) that satisfies: when x geqslant 4, f(x)={(dfrac{1}{2})}^{x}; when x < 4, f(x)=f(x+1).

You are tasked with reconnecting them with minimal work. It takes two minutes to cut and weld a link. Note: Each link in the chain consists of three rings.","output":"1. To connect five parts of a chain by performing the minimum amount of work, we need to consider the most efficient way to handle the joining process.    2. Given that each part has three rings, and it takes 2 minutes to cut and solder one ring, our goal is to minimize the number of cuts and solders. 3. If we cut one ring from each part, it would require a new ring for each additional connection made between parts, leading to multiple unnecessary operations. 4. Instead, let's identify an optimal strategy: We will cut all three rings from one single part. This will provide us with three independent rings that can be used to join the remaining four parts together. # Detailed Steps:    - **Consider one part of the chain**, which consists of three rings.    - **Cut all three rings** from this part. This operation will create three open rings.    - **Use these three open rings** to connect the remaining four parts of the chain.     # Connecting the Parts:    - **Step 1**: Connect the first open ring to join the first and second parts.    - **Step 2**: Connect the second open ring to join the second and third parts.    - **Step 3**: Connect the third open ring to join the third and fourth parts.    - **Step 4**: Now, the chain is connected with the remaining fourth and fifth parts already forming the complete chain. This approach ensures that: - Only one part is sacrificed (the one whose three rings we cut). - We effectively use the three open rings created to join the four remaining parts of the chain. # Calculation of Time: - **Time to cut three rings**: ( 3 text{ cuts} times 2 text{ minutes per cut} = 6 text{ minutes} ). - **Time to solder the connections**: Since we are using the cut rings to connect parts, additional soldering time is not required beyond the cutting process. # Conclusion: Therefore, the minimum time required to join the five parts of the chain by cutting three rings and connecting them accordingly is: [ boxed{6 text{ minutes}} ]"},{"instruction":"Given that i is the imaginary unit, and the complex number z satisfies iz=3+4i, then |z|=　　.

Using the segment ratios: [ frac{QE}{BE} = frac{2}{5}, quad frac{RE}{CF} = frac{2}{5}, ] and knowing that BE and CF are proportional to AB and AC respectively, the ratio frac{[QER]}{[ABC]} simplifies to: [ frac{[QER]}{[ABC]} = left(frac{2}{5}right)^2 = frac{4}{25}. ] Thus, we obtain: [ boxed{frac{[QER]}{[ABC]} = frac{4}{25}}. ]"},{"instruction":"At an Olympiad, mathrm{m}>1 students solved mathrm{n}>1 problems.

Without loss of generality, the remaining ( m' ) students and ( n' ) problems retain the conditions where:    - Each of the ( m' ) students solves a distinct number of problems.    - Each of the ( n' ) problems is solved by a distinct number of students. 3. **Applying the Pigeonhole Principle**:    - Assume ( m' geq 1 ), ( n' geq 1 ).    - Suppose that the students solve between 2 to ( n' ) problems ((2, 3, ldots, n')).    - This means there are ( n'-1 ) distinct values a student can solve a problem count. 4. **Evaluating the Relationship**:    - If the ( m' ) students each solve a different number of problems, we should have ( m' leq n'-1 ).    - Similarly, each problem is solved by a certain number of students ranging from 1 to ( m' ).    - Hence, ( n' ) problems, each tackled by 1 to ( m' ) students, imply ( n' leq m' ). 5. **Deriving the Contradiction**:    - From the above points:       [      m' leq n' - 1 quad text{and} quad n' leq m'       ]      Combining these inequalities:      [      m' leq n' - 1 quad text{and} quad n' leq m'      ]    - These conditions imply:      [      n' leq m' leq n' - 1      ]      which is a contradiction because an integer ( m' ) cannot simultaneously be less than or equal to ( n' ) and greater than or equal to ( n'-1 ) while ( n' ) and ( m' ) are both positive integers. 6. **Conclusion**:    Therefore, the initial assumption must be false, implying there exists at least one student who solved exactly one problem.

When a < 0, the parabola y=ax^{2}+ax-1 opens downward. For the inequality to hold true for all real numbers, the parabola must not intersect the x-axis, meaning the discriminant Delta = a^{2}+4a < 0. This simplifies to a(a+4) < 0, which gives us -4 < a < 0. 3. When a > 0, the parabola opens upward, and the function value y is not always less than 0. Therefore, the solution set cannot be mathbb{R}. Combining all cases, the range of values for a is (-4,0]. Thus, the correct answer is D. We consider three cases: 1.

The circles Gamma and Gamma_0 intersect at point Q, and the circles Gamma' and Gamma_0' intersect at point Q'. Suppose that Gamma intersects BC at point P and Gamma' intersects BC at point P'. 3. Draw the altitude AH of triangle ABC. We need to prove that the intersection point N of lines PQ and P'Q' lies on this altitude. 4. First, note that SP and SQ are two chords of the circle Gamma that meet at S. Therefore, SP = SQ and angle SIP = angle SPQ = angle SQP. 5. Since SQ is a chord of Gamma_0 intersecting BC, then SQ satisfies the power of a point theorem: SQ^2 = SB cdot SC.  6. Using coordinates: SQ^2 = (SP - BP)(SP + CP) = SP^2 + (CP - BP) cdot SP - BP cdot CP.  7. Solving for SP gives: SP = frac{BP cdot CP}{CP - BP} = frac{(p-b)(p-c)}{(p-c)-(p-b)} = frac{(p-b)(p-c)}{b-c}.  8. Next, observe: HP = BP - BH = p - b - c cos angle ABC.  9. We then find: HP = frac{a+b+c}{2} - b - c cdot frac{a^2 + c^2 - b^2}{2ac} = frac{(b-c)(b+c-a)}{2a} = frac{(b-c)(p-a)}{a}.  10. Since IP = frac{Delta}{p}, we get: tan angle SIP = frac{SP}{IP} = frac{p(p-b)(p-c)}{Delta (b-c)}.  11. Given tan angle HPT = tan angle SIP: HT = HP tan angle HPT = frac{(b-c)(p-a)}{a} cdot frac{p(p-b)(p-c)}{Delta(b-c)} = frac{p(p-a)(p-b)(p-c)}{a Delta}.  12. Using Heron's formula: Delta^2 = p(p-a)(p-b)(p-c).  13. Hence: HT = frac{Delta^2}{a Delta} = frac{Delta}{a} = frac{1}{2}AH.  14. Therefore, point T is the midpoint of AH, implying line PQ passes through the midpoint of AH. 15. Using a similar method for Gamma' and Gamma_0', we show line P'Q' also passes through the midpoint of AH. 16. Consequently, PQ and P'Q' intersect at the midpoint of AH, which implies point N is the midpoint of AH, and thus:  AN perp BC.  blacksquare"},{"instruction":"The diameter ( AB ) of a circle of radius ( 4 ) is extended to a point ( D ) outside the circle so that ( BD = 5 ).

The distance between the center of the ellipse and each focus is c, where c^2 = a^2 - b^2. In this problem, a^2 = 25 and b^2 = 4, so c = sqrt{a^2 - b^2} = sqrt{25-4} = sqrt{21}. Given the distance between A and B as |AB| = 8, we use the property of an ellipse that the sum of the distances from any point on the ellipse to the two foci is constant and equal to 2a. Hence, for this ellipse, that sum is 2 cdot 5 = 10. Therefore, for points A and B, we have: |AF_1| + |AF_2| = |BF_1| + |BF_2| = 10. Since A, F_2, and B are collinear and A and B lie on the ellipse, the segment F_2B is part of the sum of distances AF_1 + AF_2. In other words, the segment AB lies between A and F_2, and as such, when we sum up the lengths of AF_1, AF_2, and BF_1, we are essentially double-counting the length of AB. Thus, we can write: |AF_1| + |AF_2| + |BF_1| = |AF_1| + |AB| + |BF_1| = 2a + |AB| = 2 cdot 5 + 8 = 18. However, since we have double-counted |AB|, we need to subtract it once to get the original sum: |AF_1| + |BF_1| = 18 - 8 = 10. Upon observation of the answer choices, we can see that none of the options match 10, which means that there might be a mistake in either the original problem or the solution. Let's examine the process again: we established that the sum of the distances from any point on the ellipse to the two foci is 2a = 10 not 2 cdot 5 = 10. Therefore, using the correct constant sum of the distances: |AF_1| + |BF_1| = 2a - |AB| = 10 - 8 = boxed{2}. However, this also does not appear in the given options, which implies there may be an error in the interpretation of the problem or there might be a typo in the choices.

At this point, grassland A has completely regrown to its original state as it was when the cows initially started grazing. What is the simplest integer ratio of the area of grassland A to the area of grassland B?","output":"1. **Understanding the Problem:**    - A grassland is divided into two parts, ( mathrm{A} ) and ( mathrm{B} ), which are not equal in size.    - A herd of cattle eats the grass on part ( mathrm{A} ) completely in 7 days.    - The herd then moves to part ( mathrm{B} ) and eats the grass there completely in 4 days.    - By the time they finish eating part ( mathrm{B} ), the grass on part ( mathrm{A} ) has regrown to the original amount. 2. **Setting Up the Problem:**    - Let the rate of grass growth in part ( mathrm{A} ) be 1 unit per day. Therefore, in 4 days, part ( mathrm{A} ) grows 4 units of grass.    - Let the initial amount of grass in part ( mathrm{A} ) be ( 4 ) units.    - The herd eats part ( mathrm{A} ) (4 units) completely in 7 days. 3. **Calculating the Eating Rate:**    - The total amount of grass consumed by the herd in 7 days on part ( mathrm{A} ) is the initial 4 units plus the additional grass grown over 7 days.    - The amount eaten in 7 days is ( 4 + 7 times 1 = 11 ) units (since the growth rate is 1 unit per day).    - Therefore, the eating rate of the herd is ( frac{11}{7} ) units per day. 4. **Grass on Part ( mathrm{B} ):**    - The herd eats on part ( mathrm{B} ) for 4 days.    - The total grass consumed in 4 days on part ( mathrm{B} ) is ( frac{11}{7} times 4 = frac{44}{7} ) units.     5. **Growth Rate and Initial Amount in Part ( mathrm{B} ):**    - Let the growth rate of grass in part ( mathrm{B} ) be ( x ) units per day.    - Let the initial amount of grass in part ( mathrm{B} ) be ( 4x ) units.    - The total amount of grass consumed should account for both the initial amount and the grass grown in 4 days plus the regrowth period of 7 days (total of 11 days of growth). 6. **Setting Up the Equation:**    - Total amount of grass in part ( mathrm{B} ) after 11 days of growth is ( 4x + 11x = 15x ).    - We know from above that this total grass amount is ( frac{44}{7} ) units.

We aim to prove the existence of two disjoint sets ( A ) and ( B ) of 477 harbours each, such that there are no direct ferry connections between any harbour in ( A ) and any harbour in ( B ). 1. **Initial Setup**:    - Let ( V ) be the set of all 2016 harbours. 2. **Defining the problem within subgroups**:    - For any harbour ( C_1 in V ), let ( U = V setminus {C_1} ) and initially set ( W = emptyset ).  3. **Construction of sequences**:    - Starting from ( C_1 ), consider extending a route ( C_1, C_2, ldots, C_k ) such that all ( C_i ) (where ( 1 leq i leq k )) are distinct harbours connected via direct routes. 4. **Limitation of the sequence**:    - Given that it’s impossible to form a sequence of direct voyages ( C_1 - C_2 - cdots - C_{1062} ) with all distinct harbours, the maximum length ( k ) of the sequence ( C_1, C_2, ldots, C_k ) is ( k leq 1061 ). This means there must be at least ( 2016 - 1061 = 955 ) other harbours in ( V ) that we have not considered in the sequence. 5. **Categorizing harbours**:    - Move ( C_k ) from ( U ) to ( W ), and attempt to continue the sequence by starting from ( C_{k-1} ) and so on, always removing the last harbour in the sequence to ( W ) if no further extension is possible. 6. **Iterative Process**:    - Repeat the process: if a harbor cannot extend the sequence, it is moved to ( W ). If no connection exists from ( C_1 ) to any other harbour, move ( C_1 ) to ( W ) and start from another harbour not in ( W ). This process creates two sets ( U ) and ( W ), where no direct connections exist between harbours in these sets. 7. **Ensuring equal partition**:    - The iterative reduction ensures that the size of ( U ) gradually decreases by 1 each time a harbour is moved to ( W ), while the size of ( W ) increases by 1.    - Given the constraint on the sequence size, it will eventually be possible to divide ( V ) such that ( |U| = 2016 - |W| ) and ensure that ( |U| + |W| = 2016 ). During this process, by the pigeonhole principle, the situation will arise where each set has at least ( frac{2016 - 1062}{2} = 477 ) harbours. 8. **Final Adjustment**:    - If necessary, remove additional harbours from ( U ) and ( W ) to ensure both ( A subseteq U ) and ( B subseteq W ) with ( |A| = 477 ) and ( |B| = 477 ). # Conclusion: Thus, we obtain two disjoint sets ( A ) and ( B ) each containing 477 harbours, such that no direct ferry connection exists between any harbour in set ( A ) and any harbour in set ( B ).

We seek relationships between the angles subtended by segments DA and AB from point C and the given angles varphi and theta. Let angle DCA = alpha and angle ACB = beta. Considering the quadrilateral, from point of view of the circle k:    [    angle DBA = alpha    ]    In the triangle MBC:    [    theta + (alpha + beta) + (varphi + alpha) = 180^circ    ]    Simplifying this equation:    [    2alpha + beta = 180^circ - theta - varphi    ]    The right side of this equation is known, and the left side has a visual angle meaning.  3. **Reflect A and Construct Circle**:    Let A' be the reflection of A across line c. Then:    [    angle A'CM = alpha    ]    And thus:    [    2alpha + beta = angle A'CB    ]    Which is the angle subtended by the known segment A'B at C. From this, we can construct C by determining this angle on the appropriate arc of the circle (not containing M). Once C is determined, find k, the circumscribed circle of triangle ABC, and determine its second intersection with c to find point D. 4. **Verify Properties**:    The resulting quadrilateral ABCD is a cyclic quadrilateral by construction and satisfies:    [    angle DAC = varphi    ]    This ensures D and C are correct.  5. **Case Specific Adjustments**:    If the right-hand side of:    [    180^circ - theta - varphi > 0^circ    ]    That is varphi < 180^circ - theta, a unique solution exists. Repeat the above steps for c such that the angle theta is replaced by 180^circ - theta. Corresponding arcs and points are adjusted similarly to craft the complete set of solutions. 6. **Special Cases**:        If theta = 90^circ and varphi is acute, one can directly infer properties from the symmetry, taking into account the necessary adjustments involving reflections or parallels. In cases where theta = 0^circ (i.e., c parallel AB), reflections yield direct construction solutions. In summary, our solution process is correctly constructed and validated stepwise providing a solution or determining when solutions do not exist. Finally, draw your conclusion and frame it. (boxed{text{Conclusion}}): 1. If M exists and varphi < theta leq 90^circ, there will be 2 solutions. 2. If theta < 90^circ and  theta leq varphi < 180^circ - theta, there will be 1 solution. 3. If  varphi geq 180^circ - theta, there are no solutions. 4. The construction also remains valid for special alignments like c parallel AB where theta = 0^circ.  The process ensures rigorous and accurate geometric construction of the required quadrilateral."},{"instruction":"What is the maximum number of points of intersection that can occur when 2 different circles and 3 different straight lines are drawn on the same piece of paper?","output":"Let's consider the possible intersections: 1. Each circle can intersect another circle at most in 2 points. 2. Each straight line can intersect each circle in at most 2 points. With 2 circles and 3 lines, this gives 2 times 2 times 3 = 12 possible intersections. 3. Each pair of straight lines can intersect once.

Adding these up gives: - Intersections between the two circles: 2 points. - Intersections between the lines and circles: 12 points. - Intersections between the lines themselves: 3 points.

Let's consider two cases:         - Case 1: (2b mid m). In this case, (m = 2bk) for some integer (k). We can construct a tiling by placing vertical dominoes of height (2 times b) (each domino covering two rows and (b) columns) across the entire length of (m) rows.

So we have:      [      F = frac{(d^2 u + b^2 v)(p uv + 1)}{bduv}      ]      Since (gcd(u, vb) = 1), we have ( u mid 1 ), which means ( u = 1 ). Similarly, ( v mid 1 ), which means ( v = 1 ).

If the clue Four digits, sum is n has the largest number of answers for any fourdigit clue, then what is the value of n? How many answers does this clue have? Explain why no other fourdigit clue can have more answers.","output":"To solve the problem of finding the value of n for which a four-digit sum n has the largest number of distinct answers, let's proceed step-by-step. 1. **Define the Problem Setup:**     We are given a number k = 4 (since it's a four-digit problem) and we need to find the value of n (sum of the digits) that maximizes the number of distinct sets of four nonzero digits. We call this maximum number A(s, 4, 9) for a given s=n. 2. **Symmetry and Range:**     By symmetry, for a sum s using digits from 1 to 9, we can replace each digit d with 10-d. This implies A(s, 4, 9) = A(40-s, 4, 9). Therefore, we only need to consider sums in the range from 10 (minimum sum of 1 + 2 + 3 + 4) to 20, as investigating sums from 21 to 30 would give us the same number of answers as sums from 10 to 19. 3. **Calculate A(s, n, k) Recursively:**        We compute A(s, n, k) recursively. Any sum can either include or exclude the digit k. Therefore, the options to form the sum s using n digits and maximum digit k are partitioned into:     - A(s-k, n-1, k-1): where one of the digits is k,     - A(s, n, k-1): where none of the digits is k.        Hence, the recursive formula is:     [     A(s, n, k) = A(s-k, n-1, k-1) + A(s, n, k-1)     ]    4. **Boundary Conditions:**        - A(s, 1, k) = 1 if 1 leq s leq k, otherwise 0, because only one digit s can sum to s.     - A(s, n, k) = 0 if s < n (since sum of n digits has to be at least n). 5. **Fill the Table to Calculate A(s, n, k):**     We start by computing values for n=2, then n=3, and finally n=4 as shown in the existing tables provided. # Tables: For reference, we'll recreate and extend the results from the provided solution:  For n=2 [ begin{array}{l||ccccccccccccccc} n=2 & s=3 & 4 & 5 & 6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 & 11 & 12 & 13 & 14 & 15 & 16 & 17 hline k=2 & 1 &   &   &   &   &   &   &    &    &    &    &    &    &    &     k=3 & 1 & 1 & 1 &   &   &   &   &    &    &    &    &    &    &    &     k=4 & 1 & 1 & 2 & 1 & 1 &   &   &    &    &    &    &    &    &    &     k=5 & 1 & 1 & 2 & 2 & 2 & 1 & 1 &    &    &    &    &    &    &    &     k=6 & 1 & 1 & 2 & 2 & 3 & 2 & 2 & 1  & 1  &    &    &    &    &    &     k=7 & 1 & 1 & 2 & 2 & 3 & 3 & 3 & 2  & 2  & 1  & 1  &    &    &    &     k=8 & 1 & 1 & 2 & 2 & 3 & 3 & 4 & 3  & 3  & 2  & 2  & 1  & 1  &    &     k=9 & 1 & 1 & 2 & 2 & 3 & 3 & 4 & 4  & 4  & 3  & 3  & 2  & 2  & 1  & 1  hline end{array} ]  For n=3 [ begin{array}{l||cccccccccccccccccccc} n=3 & s=6 & 7 & 8 & 9 & 10 & 11 & 12 & 13 & 14 & 15 & 16 & 17 & 18 & 19 & 20 & 21 & 22 & 23 & 24 hline k=3 & 1 &   &   &   &    &    &    &    &    &    &    &    &    &    &    &    &    &    &     k=4 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 &    &    &    &    &    &    &    &    &    &    &    &    &    &    &     k=5 & 1 & 1 & 2 & 2 & 2  & 1  & 1  &    &    &    &    &    &    &    &    &    &    &    &     k=6 & 1 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 3  & 3  & 3  & 2  & 1  & 1  &    &    &    &    &    &    &    &    &     k=7 & 1 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4  & 4  & 5  & 4  & 4  & 3  & 2  & 1  & 1  &    &    &    &    &    &     k=8 & 1 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4  & 5  & 6  & 6  & 6  & 6  & 5  & 4  & 3  & 2  & 1  & 1  &    &    &     k=9 & 1 & 1 & 2 & 3 & 4  & 5  & 7  & 7  & 8  & 8  & 8  & 7  & 7  & 5  & 4  & 3  & 2  & 1  & 1  hline end{array} ]  For n=4 [ begin{array}{l||ccccccccccc} n=4 & s=10 & 11 & 12 & 13 & 14 & 15 & 16 & 17 & 18 & 19 & 20 hline k=4 & 1 &    &    &    &    &    &    &    &    &    &     k=5 & 1 & 1  & 1  & 1  &    &    &    &    &    &    &     k=6 & 1 & 1  & 2  & 2  & 3  & 2  & 2  & 1  & 1  &    &     k=7 & 1 & 1  & 2  & 3  & 4  & 4  & 5  & 4  & 4  & 3  & 2   k=8 & 1 & 1  & 2  & 3  & 5  & 5  & 7  & 7  & 8  & 7  & 7   k=9 & 1 & 1  & 2  & 3  & 5  & 6  & 8  & 9  & 11 & 11 & 12 hline end{array} ] From these calculations, we find that the maximum number of distinct answers occurs for s = 20 with 12 possible distinct answers.

We need to show that if five of these nine vertices are chosen arbitrarily, it is always possible to select four of these five vertices such that they form the vertices of a trapezium. 2. **Assume the contrary:**    Assume, for the sake of contradiction, that it is not possible to find four points among the chosen five that form a trapezium. 3. **Claim:**    For any pair of points ((X, Y)) chosen, exactly three pairs of points other than those chosen are restricted from being chosen. 4. **Proof of the claim:**    We will consider three cases based on the relative positions of (X) and (Y) on the nonagon.    - **Case 1: (X) and (Y) are adjacent.**      Let (X = A) and (Y = B). The pairs ((I, C)), ((H, D)), and ((G, E)) are restricted from being chosen because choosing any of these pairs would form a trapezium with (A) and (B).    - **Case 2: (X) and (Y) have one point between them.**      Let (X = A) and (Y = C).

The pairs ((B, C)), ((I, E)), and ((H, F)) are restricted from being chosen because choosing any of these pairs would form a trapezium with (A) and (D).    These cases collectively prove our claim that for any pair of points ((X, Y)) chosen, exactly three pairs of points other than those chosen are restricted from being chosen. 5. **Counting pairs and restrictions:**    Since we are choosing 5 points, we get (binom{5}{2} = 10) distinct pairs. From our claim, each pair restricts four pairs (including the pair being chosen itself) from being chosen. So, a total of (4 cdot binom{5}{2} = 4 cdot 10 = 40) pairs are restricted. 6. **Contradiction:**    However, there are only (binom{9}{2} = 36) pairs of vertices in a nonagon, which is less than 40. This gives a contradiction because we cannot have more restrictions than the total number of pairs available. 7. **Conclusion:**    Since our assumption leads to a contradiction, it must be false. Therefore, it is always possible to find four points among the chosen five that form the vertices of a trapezium.

This geometric property helps us understand that the ratio (frac{l_a}{m_a}) is influenced by the relative lengths of the sides of the triangle. 3. **Consider the ratios (frac{l_a}{m_a}, frac{l_b}{m_b}, frac{l_c}{m_c}):**    - We need to show that the sum of these ratios is greater than 1. To do this, we can use the fact that in any triangle, at least one of the ratios (frac{AB}{BC}, frac{BC}{CA}, frac{CA}{AB}) is (geq 1). 4. **Apply the triangle inequality:**    - By the triangle inequality, we know that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle is greater than the length of the third side. This implies that:      [      a + b > c, quad b + c > a, quad text{and} quad c + a > b      ]    - Therefore, at least one of the ratios (frac{a}{b}, frac{b}{c}, frac{c}{a}) is (geq 1). 5. **Combine the observations:**    - Since at least one of the ratios (frac{a}{b}, frac{b}{c}, frac{c}{a}) is (geq 1), and considering the geometric properties of medians and angle bisectors, we can infer that:      [      frac{l_a}{m_a} + frac{l_b}{m_b} + frac{l_c}{m_c} > 1      ] Thus, the inequality holds for any triangle (Delta ABC).

This behavior is characteristic of lines with a positive slope. Given that y = kx and k is the slope of the line, the condition for the line to pass through the first and third quadrants can be mathematically stated as k > 0. This is because a positive slope (k > 0) ensures that the line will increase in the first quadrant (where both x and y are positive) and decrease in the third quadrant (where both x and y are negative), thus satisfying the given condition. Looking at the options provided: A: -2 implies a negative slope, which does not satisfy the condition. B: -1 also implies a negative slope, which does not satisfy the condition.

A: 9 B: 10 C: 90 D: 91","output":"To determine Xiao Ming's percentile rank in the class, we first understand that percentile rank is a measure that tells us what percentage of the total scores fall below a particular score. Xiao Ming ranked 5th in a math test in a class of 48 students. 1. Since Xiao Ming is 5th when we arrange scores from highest to lowest, this means there are 47 students below him when we arrange from low to high. Therefore, Xiao Ming's score is higher than 47 out of 48 scores. 2. To find his position from the bottom (when arranged from low to high), we subtract his rank from the total number of students: 48 - 5 + 1 = 44. This means Xiao Ming's score is in the 44th position from the lowest score, or he has done better than 43 students. To calculate the percentile, we use the formula for percentile rank, which is frac{text{Number of scores below Xiao Ming's score}}{text{Total number of scores}} times 100%.  3. Substituting the values, we get frac{43}{48} times 100% = 89.58%. This means Xiao Ming's score is higher than approximately 89.58% of the scores. 4. To find the closest whole number percentiles, we notice that 48 times 90% = 43.2 and 48 times 91% = 43.68. This means that Xiao Ming's score is just above the 90th percentile but below the 91st percentile. Given the options, it's clear that options A and B (9 and 10) are incorrect because they do not represent percentile ranks in the context of this problem.

Since the train is accelerating and decelerating at the same time due to the slope, we need to find the net acceleration. The net acceleration is the difference between the acceleration due to the engine and the deceleration due to the slope: Net acceleration = Acceleration - Deceleration Net acceleration = 4 km/hr² - 3.5 km/hr² Net acceleration = 0.5 km/hr² Now, we need to convert the net acceleration from km/hr² to m/s² to be consistent with the time given in seconds. We know that 1 km/hr is approximately 0.27778 m/s (since 1 km = 1000 m and 1 hr = 3600 s), so we can convert the acceleration as follows: Net acceleration = 0.5 km/hr² * (1000 m/km) / (3600 s/hr)² Net acceleration = 0.5 * 1000 / (3600²) m/s² Net acceleration = 500 / 12960000 m/s² Net acceleration ≈ 0.03858 m/s² Now, we can use the formula for the final velocity (v) in uniformly accelerated motion, which is: v = u + at where: v = final velocity u = initial velocity a = acceleration t = time First, we need to convert the initial speed from km/hr to m/s: Initial speed (u) = 60 km/hr * (1000 m/km) / (3600 s/hr) Initial speed (u) = 60 * 1000 / 3600 m/s Initial speed (u) = 60000 / 3600 m/s Initial speed (u) ≈ 16.66667 m/s Now, we can calculate the final velocity (v) when the train crosses the pole: v = u + at v = 16.66667 m/s + (0.03858 m/s² * 3 s) v ≈ 16.66667 m/s + 0.11574 m/s v ≈ 16.78241 m/s The length of the train (L) can be calculated using the formula for distance covered in uniformly accelerated motion, which is: L = ut + (1/2)at² Since the train crosses the pole in 3 seconds, we can use this time (t) to find the length: L = (16.66667 m/s * 3 s) + (1/2 * 0.03858 m/s² * 3² s²) L = 50.00001 m + (1/2 * 0.03858 m/s² * 9 s²) L = 50.00001 m + (0.17361 m) L ≈ 50.17362 m Therefore, the length of the train is approximately boxed{50.17}  meters."},{"instruction":"f point P lies on line m, and line m is in plane α, which of the following correctly represents the relationship between P, m, and α?

According to the problem statement, we generate a new set of numbers by taking the average of each pair of consecutive elements, including the pair (a_n, a_1). We need to prove that if all numbers in the new set are integers, then all the initial numbers are either all equal, or all alternate positions are equal. 2. **Initial Condition**:    Assume that not all the initial numbers (a_1, a_2, ldots, a_n) are equal. We want to demonstrate that if the process of taking averages results in integers at each step, then these numbers must satisfy certain properties, leading to a contradiction unless they follow a pattern. 3. **Behavior of Extremes**:    Consider the maximum and minimum integers in the sequence. If not all integers are the same, in each iteration of the process, the maximum value must decrease and the minimum value must increase because each new value is an average of two integers. 4. **Iteration Process**:    Since the average of two integers is an integer, the extremes being integers will force the range to decrease until all elements must be equal. This is because there are only finitely many integers between the maximum and minimum values, leading to the conclusion that all elements eventually become the same after a finite number of iterations. Hence, after some steps (say k steps), the new set becomes ((a, a, ldots, a)). 5. **Contradiction and Parity Consideration**:    Suppose we have a set of unequal integers (z_1, z_2, ldots, z_n) and they become a uniform set after some steps as mentioned in the previous point. We now need to show that initially, the numbers must be in a certain form if they are not equal right from the start.    Let's assume that eventually, the sequence becomes (frac{z_1 + z_2}{2} = frac{z_2 + z_3}{2} = cdots = frac{z_n + z_1}{2}).    This would imply (z_{i+2} = z_i) for each (i), indicating a periodic pattern where numbers at even indices are one value and at odd indices are another value. 6. **Proof for Even n**:    If (n) is even, assume (z_i) follows the pattern:    [    z_{2i-1} = a quad text{and} quad z_{2i} = b quad (1 leq i leq frac{n}{2}).    ]    Then each pairwise averaging gives:    [    frac{z_{2i-1} + z_{2i}}{2} = frac{a + b}{2} quad (1 leq i leq frac{n}{2}),    ]    [    frac{z_{2i} + z_{2i+1}}{2} = frac{b + a}{2} = frac{a + b}{2}.     ]    Hence, all averages are integers, confirming the initial assumption of the periodic pattern. 7. **Conclusion**:    If (n) is odd, such pairing is impossible because positions cannot be matched alternately without repeat over an odd number of indices. This leads to the only possibility of all numbers being equal from the start for pairs to align correctly. **Therefore, either (a_i = a_j) for all (i, j) or the initial numbers must be in an alternating form where every second number is equal, specifically (a, b, a, b, ldots, a, b) for some integers (a) and (b).** blacksquare"},{"instruction":"The graph of the function f(x)=sin (2x+θ), where θ∈(frac{π}{2},frac{π}{2}), is shifted right by φ(φ > 0) units to obtain the graph of the function g(x).

When the person is walking on the moving escalator, their effective speed is the sum of their walking speed and the speed of the escalator. So, the effective speed is ( v + 12 ) ft/sec. We know that the person takes 8 seconds to cover the entire length of the escalator, which is 160 feet. We can use the formula for distance, which is: [ text{Distance} = text{Speed} times text{Time} ] Given that the distance is 160 feet and the time is 8 seconds, we can set up the equation: [ 160 = (v + 12) times 8 ] Now, we solve for ( v ): [ 160 = 8v + 96 ] Subtract 96 from both sides: [ 160 - 96 = 8v ] [ 64 = 8v ] Divide both sides by 8: [ v = frac{64}{8} ] [ v = 8 ] So, the rate at which the person walks on the escalator is boxed{8}  ft/sec."},{"instruction":"Prove that the inequality (12) leads to the inequalities of problem 382, but also that from those inequalities, we can always infer the inequality (12).","output":"To prove that the inequality ((12)) implies the inequalities of exercise (382), and vice versa, we need to delve into the workings of convex functions and their properties. Here, we utilize the concept of a convex function characterized by the fact that the slope between any two points on the function is ordered according to the point's positions. 1. We start by stating the general property of convex functions.  2. A function ( f(x) ) is convex if for any four points ( x_1, x_2, xi_1, xi_2 ) such that ( x_1 leq xi_1 ) and ( x_2 leq xi_2 ), but the two segments between these points do not coincide, the inequality     [    frac{f(x_2) - f(x_1)}{x_2 - x_1} leq frac{f(xi_2) - f(xi_1)}{xi_2 - xi_1}    ]    holds. This property stems from the definition of convexity, where the function lies below the line segment joining any two points on its graph. For convex functions, the slopes of the chords (line segments between two points on the graph) increase as you move from left to right. 3. Considering the extremities where points coincide, we can analyze three cases involving the points ( x_1, x_2, xi_1, xi_2 ):    **Case 1: ( x_1 = xi_1 )**    [    frac{f(x_2) - f(x_1)}{x_2 - x_1} < frac{f(xi_2) - f(xi_1)}{xi_2 - xi_1}    ]    This showcases direct inequality when one point from the interval ([x_1, x_2]) coincides with one point from the interval ([xi_1, xi_2]).    **Case 2: ( x_2 = xi_2 )**    [    frac{f(x_2) - f(x_1)}{x_2 - x_1} < frac{f(xi_2) - f(xi_1)}{xi_2 - xi_1}    ]    This shows the inequality when another point from ([x_1, x_2]) coincides with another point from ([xi_1, xi_2]).    **Case 3: ( x_2 = xi_1 )**    [    frac{f(xi_1) - f(x_1)}{xi_1 - x_1} < frac{f(xi_2) - f(xi_1)}{xi_2 - xi_1}    ]    Here, one segment ends while another begins at the same point, showcasing an intermediate slope comparison. 4. Utilizing these cases, we assess configurations:    - **When ( x_2 < xi_1 )**, by Case 1, we get:      [      frac{f(x_2) - f(x_1)}{x_2 - x_1} < frac{f(xi_1) - f(x_1)}{xi_1 - x_1}      ]      And by Case 3, we have:      [      frac{f(xi_1) - f(x_1)}{xi_1 - x_1} < frac{f(xi_2) - f(xi_1)}{xi_2 - xi_1}      ]      Combining these:      [      frac{f(x_2) - f(x_1)}{x_2 - x_1} < frac{f(xi_2) - f(xi_1)}{xi_2 - xi_1}      ]    - **When ( x_2 > xi_1 )**, by Case 2, we derive:      [      frac{f(x_2) - f(x_1)}{x_2 - x_1} < frac{f(xi_2) - f(x_1)}{xi_2 - x_1}      ]      And by Case 1, we reorder:      [      frac{f(xi_2) - f(x_1)}{xi_2 - x_1} < frac{f(xi_2) - f(xi_1)}{xi_2 - xi_1}      ]      Leading to:      [      frac{f(x_2) - f(x_1)}{x_2 - x_1} < frac{f(xi_2) - f(xi_1)}{xi_2 - xi_1}      ]    Thus, through these intermediate steps and establishing these comparisons, we have demonstrated that:    [    frac{f(x_2) - f(x_1)}{x_2 - x_1} < frac{f(xi_2) - f(xi_1)}{xi_2 - xi_1}    ]    is valid under any point configuration (x_1, x_2, xi_1, xi_2). 5.

Kate's hair is 7 inches long and Emily's hair is 26 inches long. To find the ratio of Kate's hair length to Emily's hair length, we divide the length of Kate's hair by the length of Emily's hair: Kate's hair length : Emily's hair length = 7 inches : 26 inches To simplify the ratio, we can divide both numbers by the greatest common divisor, which in this case is 1 (since 7 is a prime number and does not divide evenly into 26).

Let's choose vertex ( C ) and point ( M ) on ( AB ) such that the line ( CM ) intersects ( AB ). 4. **Drawing and calculations**:     - Note that ( CM ) splits the trapezoid into two triangular types regions: triangular region ( triangle CMD ) and quadrilateral region ( MBCA ).      - To ensure the configuration of a parallelogram, this cut line ( CM ) should maintain parallelism criteria (essentially parallelogram side criteria). 5. **Rearranging into a parallelogram**:     - The resulting two parts after the cut can be rearranged by rotating and sliding the triangular part appropriately to the other portion's side, forming a parallelogram whereby two opposite sides are equal and parallel.

For (1+x)^8, we need to determine the binomial coefficients of terms binom{8}{k}, where k=0, 1, 2, dots, 8.

We extend the segments AM and BC to intersect at point K. 2. **Analyse triangles CMK and DMA:**     Since M is the midpoint of CD, and because ABCD is a parallelogram, we know that CD parallel AB. Therefore, angle CMD = angle AMD and angle CMA = angle DMA.          By property of parallelogram:     - CD = AB, therefore CM = MD.      - AM = MK (as M is midpoint of CD).     triangle CMK cong triangle DMA (SAS postulate, as CM = MD, angle CMD = angle AMD, and AM = MK). 3. **Lengths Implication of Congruence:**    By congruence of triangle CMK and triangle DMA, we have:     CK = DA = BC. 4. **Relate K, H, and Median concept:**     Now, considering triangle BHK, we see that H is the projection of B onto AM. In this right triangle, H is on the extension line from B perpendicular to AM (through M), meaning it splits angle B into two right angles, making H the orthocenter.     Because M was defined as the midpoint, H being projected forms the midpoint segment. 5. **Conclusion:**     We realize CH=BC based on the medians and congruence properties defined.

Prove that each of them can be simultaneously moved to one of the adjacent diagonal squares in such a way that after the move, none of them will attack another. Recall that a chess rook attacks all the squares on the same row and column on which it stands.","output":"1. Given a standard chessboard of dimension 8 times 8, we have placed 8 rooks in such a way that no rook can attack another. A chess rook can move horizontally or vertically and attacks any piece along the row or column it occupies.     2. Each rook is standing on unique rows and columns due to the given condition that no rook can attack another, forming a bijection between the rows and columns they occupy. 3. The task is to prove that each rook can be moved to one of the neighboring diagonal cells such that after the move, no two rooks can attack each other. 4. To begin, we divide the chessboard into 16 squares of size 2 times 2. Each 2 times 2 square contains four cells arranged in a grid. 5. Since there are 8 non-attacking rooks on the board, each one is in a separate column and row. Thus, each 2 times 2 square can contain at most one rook, if any. 6. We need to move each rook one step diagonally. For a rook initially at (i,j) (where 1 leq i,j leq 8), the diagonally adjacent cells are (i+1,j+1), (i+1,j-1), (i-1,j+1), and (i-1,j-1), if they lie within the bounds of the board. 7. Consider the configuration within any 2 times 2 square. The idea is to shift the rooks along the diagonals within these mini-squares such that no two rooks end up in the same row or column after shifting. 8. The proposed movement will be as follows:    - If a rook is at the top-left cell of a 2 times 2 square, it moves to the bottom-right cell of the same square.    - If a rook is at the top-right cell of a 2 times 2 square, it moves to the bottom-left cell of the same square.    - If a rook is at the bottom-left cell of a 2 times 2 square, it moves to the top-right cell of the same square.    - If a rook is at the bottom-right cell of a 2 times 2 square, it moves to the top-left cell of the same square.     9. After these moves, within each 2 times 2 square:    - The column and row properties are preserved within the mini-square structure.    - There is no overlap of rows or columns across different 2 times 2 squares. 10. Since no initial placement had two rooks in the same row or column and each move keeps the rook within the bounds of a single 2 times 2 square, the new configuration ensures that still no two rooks attack each other. Conclusion: Every rook can be moved to a neighboring diagonal square without causing any conflict or attacking an adjacent rook. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"Kamal obtained 66 marks in English, some marks in Mathematics, 77 in Physics, 62 in Chemistry, and 75 in Biology (out of 100).

Are these quadrilaterals necessarily equal?","output":":  Given the problem, we need to determine if two quadrilaterals are necessarily congruent if the list of their side lengths and diagonals are identical when ordered in increasing length.  1. **Understanding the Problem:**     - To conclude whether the quadrilaterals must be congruent, we need to check if matching side lengths and diagonal lengths outrightly determine congruence.     - For a quadrilateral, especially a convex one, the four sides and two diagonals give us a total of 6 lengths to compare. 2. **Checking a Counterexample:**     - Consider a specific counterexample to demonstrate that even if the length lists are identical, the shape of the quadrilaterals may still differ.  3. **Constructing the Isosceles Trapezoid:**     - An **isosceles trapezoid** is a quadrilateral with one pair of parallel sides, in this case, bases of lengths (2) and (4), and legs that are equal.     - Let the height of the trapezoid be (1). 4. **Calculations for the Isosceles Trapezoid:**     - Since the height is (1), and the distance between the midpoints of the bases (which is (4-2 = 2)), each leg can be calculated using the Pythagorean Theorem:     [     text{leg} = sqrt{ left( frac{4-2}{2} right)^2 + 1^2} = sqrt{1^2 + 1} = sqrt{2}     ]     - Diagonals of the isosceles trapezoid:     [     d_1, d_2 = sqrt{ h^2 + text{(difference of the bases + half the other base)}^2} = sqrt{ 1 + 3^2 } = sqrt{10}     ] 5. **Constructing Another Quadrilateral:**     - Create a second quadrilateral with perpendicular diagonals of lengths (2) and (4), types of quadrilaterals include rhombuses and orthogonal quadrilaterals.     - The diagonals meet at the intersection point and can be divided into segments of lengths (1, 1, 1.1, 2.9) if we adjust via the Pythagorean theorem to maintain segment equality.     Without detailing too deeply each leg, such a construction ensures matching dimensions consistent in \\"isomorphic\\" lengths but structurally distinct. 6. **Comparing Lists:**     - Both quadrilaterals now exhibit side lengths and diagonals arranging as ({1, 1, 2, sqrt{2}, sqrt{2}, 4}) in increasing length. 7. **Conclusion:**     - Since these two different quadrilaterals show the identical ordered list by side and diagonal length yet geometrically differ, the proposed isometrical properties allow variability and invalidates necessary congruences merely deduced from lists.  Therefore, the quadrilaterals need not be congruent if only their side lengths and diagonals match once arranged in increasing length. boxed{text{not necessarily}}."},{"instruction":"Magdalena has an apple tree on their farm.

On the third day, she picked 20 more apples than she picked on the first day, so she picked (1/5)A + 20 apples. After picking apples for three days, there are 20 apples remaining on the tree.

The problem now reduces to finding an unobserved planet among these 2013 planets. 6. **Iterative Exclusion**:    We repeat the same argument for these 2013 planets.

Here's the step-by-step breakdown of the proof: 1. **Define Key Terms:**    - Set ( mathcal{A} = {A_1, A_2, ..., A_m} ) of composed large tribe.    - For any two subsets ( A_i, A_j in mathcal{A} ), there is a tribe of disjoint sets where each combination provides multiple disjoint connecting paths. 2. **Externally ( k )-connected Sets:**    - A vertex set ( X subseteq V(G) ) is called externally ( k )-connected if, for ( |X| geq k ) and any non-intersecting ( Y, Z subseteq X ) with ( |Y| = |Z| leq k ), there are ( |Y| ) disjoint ( Y-Z ) paths such that their interior vertices or edges are not in ( G[X] ). 3. **Illustrate Key Insight:**    - Any graph with sufficiently large tree-width contains a large externally ( k )-connected vertex set. Conversely, large externally ( k )-connected sets only exist in graphs with large tree-width. 4. **Consider Maximum Capabilities:**    - Any graph with a sufficiently large tree-width, like networks containing dissections of large externally ( k )-connected sets, manifests typically as barriers for smaller tree-width graphs. A graph ( G ) containing a sufficiently large externally ( k )-connected vertex set corresponds exactly to the adequate tree-width qualified for the theorem. 5. **Hypothetical Settings:**    - Assume ( 2 leq m leq r^2 ). Let ( c = r^{4(r+2)} ) and ( k = c^{2(2)} ). Hence, with ( c geq 2^{16} ), and since ( 2m + 3 leq c^m ), the tree-width of ( G ) should be at least ( k ). 6. **Conclusions on Intersecting Paths:**    - Even though many paths ( A_{i}-A_{j} ) might intersect initially, we need specialized sets ( mathcal{P}_{ij} ) and ( mathcal{P}_{pq} ) such that indexes ( sigma(pq) = ell ) lead to selecting ( A_p - A_q ) paths ( P_{pq} ) which do not intersect earlier chosen paths. 7. **Establishing Required Number of Paths:**    - Using Lemma 12.4.5 and other supporting exercises, demonstrate each step iteratively, maintaining that paths do maintain non-intersection through progressively fewer paths until sufficient non-intersecting paths cover the required grid. 8. **Validation of Grid Minor:**    - By induction on necessary path counts, confirm ( k ) is enough to ensure all required paths can be covered appropriately to infer the ( r times r ) grid minor in ( G ). 9. **Achieving Results:**    - Conclude each reduction leads to non-intersecting paths fully resolving into the necessary grid format, thus ensuring ( K^{m} ) structures inferred from edges and vertices disjoint counts. 10. **Assertion of Theorem 12.4.4:**     - Ultimately, showing that the graph contains the large grid minor, proving assertively for every ( r ), a ( k ) supports induced ( r times r ) grid graphs conclusively. Ultimately, our proof reaches the conclusion that for any integer ( r ), there exists a sufficiently large ( k ) such that any graph with tree-width at least ( k ) contains an ( r times r ) grid as a minor, encapsulated as: [ boxed{k}. ]"},{"instruction":"the Cartesian coordinate system (xOy), the parametric equations of the curve C_1 are given by begin{cases} x=tcos alpha  y=1+tsin alpha end{cases} where t is a parameter and 0leqslant alpha < pi.

Thus, there exists at least one point ( D ) in ( S ) not lying on the line formed by some other points in S. 2. **Selecting the Minimum Distance**:    Consider the configuration where a point and a line in ( S ) have the smallest non-zero distance. That is, let ( D ) be a point in ( S ) and let ( l ) be a line formed by points in ( S ) such that the distance from ( D ) to ( l ) is minimized and non-zero. 3. **Points on Line ( l )**:    Let ( A ), ( B ), and ( C ) be points on the line ( l ). By assumption, since ( l ) is formed by points of ( S ), every pair of points on ( l ) (e.g., ( A ) and ( B )) and the point ( D ) should lie on a common line. This implies that the distance ( d ) from ( D ) to ( l ) is considered in our scenario of minimal non-zero distance.  4. **Contra-Argument from Minimal Distance**:    By the ordering of distance:    - Since the configuration implies minimal non-zero distance ( d ), consider the projections (perpendicular) of ( D ) to line ( l ).  5. **Same Side Analysis**:    Select points ( B ) and ( C ) on line ( l ). Without loss of generality, assume ( B ) and ( C ) are on the same side of the perpendicular projection from ( D ) to ( l ) (in this argument, they can be reflected across the perpendicular they project onto).    - As per the configuration and geometric constraints, if ( C ) is further from the perpendicular drop directly onto line ( l ), then the hypothesized closest pair (D, ( l )) would be contradicted, since moving point ( C ) would generate a smaller corresponding distance ensemble (which cannot happen by initial construction). 6. **Contradiction and Conclusion**:    This analysis leads to a contradiction of the original assumption of minimized non-zero distance owing to geometric constraints that contradict our hypothesized configuration. Thus, the proper conclusion must be that our assumption that not all points ( S ) are on a single line was incorrect. Therefore, we conclude that in fact, all points in the set S must be collinear.

Let ( g(x_1, ldots, x_n) = f_n(x_1, ldots, x_n) - (n mod 2) ). Then essentially the claim is saying that ( x_i - 1 mid g_n(x_1, ldots, x_n) ). Plugging ( x_n = 1 ), we see:    [    f(x_1, ldots, x_{n-1}, 1) = 1 + sum_{1 le i le n-1} frac{1 - x_i}{x_i - 1} prod_{substack{j neq i  j neq n}} frac{1 - x_i x_j}{x_i - x_j} = 1 - f_{n-1}(x_1, ldots, x_{n-1}).    ]    By induction on the original problem statement, ( f_{n-1}(x_1, ldots, x_{n-1}) = (n-1 mod 2) ). Hence by the above, ( f(x_1, ldots, x_{n-1}, 1) = (n mod 2) ), i.e., ( g(x_1, ldots, x_{n-1}, 1) = 0 ). Treating ( g(x_1, ldots, x_n) ) as a polynomial in ( x_n ), this proves ( x_n - 1 mid g(x_1, ldots, x_n) ), as needed. (blacksquare) 3. **Claim 2:**    For all ( 1 le i < j le n ), we have ( x_i - x_j mid P_n(x_1, ldots, x_n) ).    **Proof:**    Fix ( a < b ), and assume ( x_a = x_b ). We will prove ( P_n(x_1, ldots, x_n) = 0 ). We have:    [    f_n(x_1, ldots, x_n) = sum_{1 le i le n} S_i(x_1, ldots, x_n),    ]    where the summand ( S_i ) is:    [    S_i(x_1, ldots, x_n) = frac{(1 - x_i x_1) cdots (1 - x_i x_{i-1})(1 - x_i x_{i+1}) cdots (1 - x_i x_n)}{(x_i - x_1) cdots (x_i - x_{i-1})(x_i - x_{i+1}) cdots (x_i - x_n)}.    ]    For a fixed ( k ), when we multiply ( S_k ) through by ( prod_{i < j} (x_i - x_j) ), we get a product, and this product contains all terms of the form ( (x_i - x_j) ), where ( i neq k ). In particular, ( S_k ) for ( k notin {a, b} ) is a product which contains ( x_a - x_b ) (or its negative), and hence ( S_k = 0 ) for ( k notin {a, b} ). So actually ( f_n = S_a + S_b ), so:    [    P_n = S_a prod_{i < j} (x_i - x_j) + S_b prod_{i < j} (x_i - x_j).    ]    We see that:    [    S_a prod_{i < j} (x_i - x_j) = left( prod_{i neq a} (1 - x_a x_i) right) cdot left( (-1)^{a-1} prod_{i < j, i, j neq a} (x_i - x_j) right),    ]    [    S_b prod_{i < j} (x_i - x_j) = left( prod_{i neq b} (1 - x_b x_i) right) cdot left( (-1)^{b-1} prod_{i < j, i, j neq b} (x_i - x_j) right).    ]    where the ( (-1)^{a-1} ) comes due to the fact that when we multiply ( prod (x_i - x_j) ), the terms ( x_a - x_1, ldots, x_a - x_{a-1} ) need to be switched in sign.    We claim that on the RHS, the first terms are equal and the second terms are negatives. For the first terms, note that since ( x_a = x_b ):    [    prod_{i neq a} (1 - x_a x_i) = frac{prod_{i} (1 - x_a x_i)}{1 - x_a^2} = frac{prod_{i} (1 - x_b x_i)}{1 - x_b^2} = prod_{i neq b} (1 - x_b x_i),    ]    as needed. For the second terms, we want to show:    [    (-1)^{a-1} prod_{i < j, i, j neq a} (x_i - x_j) = - (-1)^{b-1} prod_{i < j, i, j neq b} (x_i - x_j).    ]    It suffices to show the \\"complement\\"; however, we have to remove ( x_a - x_b ) since it is equal to ( 0 ). We want to show:    [    (-1)^{a-1} prod_{substack{i < j  a in {i, j}  (i, j) neq (a, b)}} (x_i - x_j) = -(-1)^{b-1} prod_{substack{i < j  b in {i, j}  (i, j) neq (a, b)}} (x_i - x_j).    ]    Writing out the LHS and RHS above (omitting the ( (-1) ) powers):    [    (x_a - x_{a+1}) cdots (x_a - x_{b-1}) underbrace{(x_a - x_{b+1}) cdots (x_a - x_n)}_{(spadesuit)} underbrace{(x_1 - x_a) cdots (x_{a-1} - x_a)}_{(heartsuit)},    ]    [    underbrace{(x_b - x_{b+1}) cdots (x_b - x_n)}_{(spadesuit)} underbrace{(x_1 - x_b) cdots (x_{a-1} - x_b)}_{(heartsuit)} (x_{a+1} - x_b) cdots (x_{b-1} - x_b).    ]    The corresponding sets of terms are underlined under common ( (heartsuit) ) and ( (spadesuit) ) braces. The remaining terms can be paired up in pairs that are negatives of each other. Since there are ( b - a - 1 ) such pairs, the quotient of the LHS and RHS is ( (-1)^{b - a - 1} ). This proves the desired. (blacksquare) 4. **Conclusion:**    From Claim 2, we know:    [    prod_{i < j} (x_i - x_j) mid P_n(x_1, ldots, x_n).    ]    Hence ( f_n(x_1, ldots, x_n) ) is actually a polynomial, not just a rational function. Now, Claim 1 implies that:    [    (x_1 - 1) cdots (x_n - 1) mid f_n(x_1, ldots, x_n) - (n mod 2).    ]    But ( deg f_n(x_1, ldots, x_n) = n - 1 ). Even with multiple variables, it is impossible for a degree ( n ) polynomial to divide a nonzero degree ( n - 1 ) polynomial. Therefore, ( f_n(x_1, ldots, x_n) = (n mod 2) ).

Because the greatest digit sum for a two-digit number is 9 + 9 = 18, the number must have at least three digits. Furthermore, to achieve the digit sum with minimal total value, it's optimal to have a minimal digit higher than zero as the leading digit.  - Starting from 1 as the first digit, we seek additional digits totaling 23 - 1 = 22. A potential smallest number could be 1999, where 1 + 9 + 9 + 9 = 28, which is higher than needed. - Adjust to 229 where 2 + 2 + 9 = 13—still insufficient. - Next, we try 1999: 1 + 9 + 9 + 9 = 28 doesn't work. - Finally, we look at 1999, adding up to 1 + 9 + 9 + 9 = 28. - Adjust to a three-digit sequence starting with smallest digits, yielding 799 where 7 + 9 + 9 = 25, which is too much.    For achieving exactly 23, 494 (smallest increasing digits' order) should work where 4 + 9 + 4 = 17, so that doesn't fit either. After trying several reasonable adjustments, let's then explore 499, as 4 + 9 + 9 = 22, which is close but still does not satisfy the sum requirement. After some exploratory calculations, it seems feasible to construct the number 499 as a candidate. For primality confirmation: - **Divisibility Check**: The number 499 is odd and does not end in 0 or 5, so it's not divisible by 2 or 5. - **Divisibility by 3, 7, or 11:**    - Digit sum is 22, not divisible by 3.    - 499, by quick checks, is not divisible by 7 or 11.    - Conduct outright divisions for 7 and 11 for absolute verification. - **Prime Determination**: After elimination through divisibility checks, confirm through actual division tests for primes less than sqrt{499} approx 22.33 (i.e., primes up to 19).

Hence, the evenness of the number of triangles containing the point P remains unchanged when transitioning between neighboring regions. # Conclusion:    Given that the exterior region (where the count of triangles is zero) has an even number of triangles containing point P, and the construction of regions preserves this evenness, we conclude that the point P inside the convex 2n-gon will always reside within an even number of triangles with vertices at the points A_1, A_2, ldots, A_{2n}. blacksquare"},{"instruction":"Let ( S(n) ) denote the sum of the digits of a natural number ( n ).

The LCM of 6 and 9 is 18 (since 6 = 2 × 3 and 9 = 3^2, the LCM is 2 × 3^2 = 18). So, ( n ) must be a multiple of 18. Additionally, when ( n ) is divided by 7, there is a remainder of 1. This can be expressed as: [ n equiv 1 mod 7 ] Now, we need to find a multiple of 18 that leaves a remainder of 1 when divided by 7. We can check multiples of 18 and see which one satisfies this condition: - 18 divided by 7 leaves a remainder of 4. - 36 divided by 7 leaves a remainder of 1. (This is a potential solution) - 54 divided by 7 leaves a remainder of 5. - 72 divided by 7 leaves a remainder of 3. - 90 divided by 7 leaves a remainder of 6. From the multiples of 18 between 11 and 100, only 36 satisfies the condition of leaving a remainder of 1 when divided by 7. Therefore, the number of candies is boxed{36} ."},{"instruction":"Let L be the intersection point of the lines AP and CM, and S be the intersection point of the lines AN and CQ. Prove that LS | PQ.","output":"1. Given the points and lines, let's first establish that ( C I ) is the angle bisector of (angle P C Q):     [ P I = I Q ]     This implies that point ( I ) lies at the midpoint of the arc ( P Q ) on the circumcircle of triangle ( A I C ).     2. Define ( T ) as the intersection point of lines ( A P ) and ( C Q ). 3. Apply the Thales Theorem to the situation. The theorem suggests that the sought parallelism ( L S parallel P Q ) is equivalent to the proportionality condition:     [ frac{T L}{T P} = frac{T S}{T Q} ]     4. Using the properties of the angle bisector and triangle similarity:     - For triangle ( T P C ):          [ frac{T L}{T P} = frac{T C}{P C} ]     - For triangle ( T Q A ):         [ frac{T S}{T Q} = frac{T A}{Q A} ]      5. Because triangles ( T P C ) and ( T Q A ) are similar by the Angle-Angle (AA) criterion (their corresponding angles are equal), the following relation holds:     [     frac{T C}{P C} = frac{T A}{Q A}     ] 6. Now, using these established proportions:     - From the similarity ratios, we substitute back into the initial proportion:       [       frac{T L}{T P} = frac{T C}{P C} quad text{and} quad frac{T S}{T Q} = frac{T A}{Q A}       ]     - Since ( frac{T C}{P C} = frac{T A}{Q A} ), this implies:       [       frac{T L}{T P} = frac{T S}{T Q}       ]       which directly leads to the parallelism condition:       [       L S parallel P Q       ] # Conclusion:  [ boxed{L S parallel P Q} ]"}]`),D={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:B},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:4,poemsData:P,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){const n=this.searchQuery.trim().toLowerCase();return n?this.poemsData.filter(e=>e.instruction&&e.instruction.toLowerCase().includes(n)||e.output&&e.output.toLowerCase().includes(n)):this.poemsData},displayedPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.filteredPoems:this.filteredPoems.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return!this.searchQuery.trim()&&this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=4,this.isLoading=!1}}},F={class:"search-container"},z={class:"card-container"},E={key:0,class:"empty-state"},I=["disabled"],M={key:0},N={key:1};function W(n,e,h,u,o,s){const m=g("PoemCard");return i(),a("section",null,[e[4]||(e[4]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🤔prompts chat🧠")])],-1)),t("div",F,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"🔍",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=r=>o.searchQuery=r),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[x,o.searchQuery]]),o.searchQuery?(i(),a("button",{key:0,class:"clear-search",onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=r=>o.searchQuery="")}," ✕ ")):c("",!0)]),t("div",z,[(i(!0),a(y,null,w(s.displayedPoems,(r,p)=>(i(),v(m,{key:p,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128)),s.displayedPoems.length===0?(i(),a("div",E,' No results found for "'+l(o.searchQuery)+'".
