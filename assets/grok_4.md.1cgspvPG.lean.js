Donald didn't have a very attractive face like Hunter.","output":"Donald sighed as he looked into the bathroom mirror, his hands slowly tracing the harsh lines of his face. Hunter, his younger brother, was the golden boy of the family - the athletic, straight-A student with perfect, angular features. He was also blessed with a warm and inviting smile that could make anyone feel like they just found their best friend. In contrast, Donald’s features seemed to be a patchwork of the leftover bits that nature didn’t deem good enough for his brother.  Donald couldn't help but envy his brother on more than one occasion. Every day, he witnessed how the world treated Hunter, how doors opened to him solely based on his looks. People weren’t generally unkind to Donald per se, but they didn’t light up in the same way when they saw him. \\"If only I looked like him,\\" Donald thought, \\"maybe I could also experience that attention, that carefree ease that Hunter walks through life with.\\" Unbeknownst to Donald, it wasn't just his looks that made him different. He had a keen intellect, an uncanny ability to work through the most complex problems with ease. Even more remarkably, Donald had an empathetic heart, able to sense and empathize with the emotions of those around him. Throughout his short life, he had made genuine friendships and created strong connections with everyone he encountered. Unfortunately, it was difficult for him to see the worth of his strengths through the fog of envy that clouded his vision.  One day, as Donald arrived at school, he noticed a group of his classmates huddled by the entrance. Curious and slightly apprehensive, he approached them to find out what they were discussing so animatedly. To his surprise, he saw a poster advertising an upcoming talent show. With prizes for the best performers, the top prize being a full scholarship to a prestigious arts school, excitement was in the air. All at once, Donald had an idea. While he may not possess his brother’s looks, he knew he had a natural talent for playing the piano. He realized that he could seize this opportunity, a chance to prove himself to the world and, in turn, boost his self-esteem. So, without a moment’s hesitation, he put his name down to participate in the talent show. Word spread fast that Donald would be competing in the talent show, and even Hunter heard the news. Surprisingly, instead of reacting with condescension or mockery, Hunter offered his unwavering support. \\"You got this, Donald,\\" he said, clapping his brother on the back. \\"I've heard you play, and you're a natural. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise.\\" In the following weeks, Donald threw himself into preparation, spending countless hours practicing and honing his piano skills. Hunter continued to support Donald, even helping him select the perfect piece to perform. The brothers grew closer, and an unspoken bond was forged, built on understanding and respect. Finally, the night of the talent show arrived. Nervous energy buzzed through the auditorium as family, friends, and fellow students gathered to watch the various acts. Donald took the stage, and as the first notes rang out, he felt a calm wash over him. His fingers danced across the keys, pouring his soul into the music. The audience was entranced, and when his performance came to an end, a thunderous applause erupted. Hunter beamed with pride as he watched from the wings, his earlier envy long forgotten in lieu of his brother's success. Donald didn't need looks to share his gift with the world; his heart and talent were more than enough. Ultimately, Donald won the talent show and received the prestigious scholarship. However, the most valuable thing he gained from the experience wasn't the trophy or the applause; it was the understanding that everyone possesses unique gifts and that true beauty lies within the passions and talents one holds close to their heart. From that day onward, Donald embraced his strengths, no longer fixating on the surface-level differences between himself and Hunter. The two brothers, now closer than ever, went on to achieve greatness in their respective fields, forever grateful for the life-changing night that brought them closer together and enlightened Donald to the hidden power within himself."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Barrie play who was the resourceful butler to the Earl of Loam?\\" is Crichton. This character, Crichton, is from the play \\"The Admirable Crichton,\\" which was written by J. M. Barrie, a famous Scottish playwright and novelist who is best known for his creation of Peter Pan. The play was first produced in 1902 and is a biting satire on British class system as well as a commentary on social issues of the time. \\"The Admirable Crichton\\" tells the story of a wealthy, British aristocratic family that becomes stranded on a deserted island after a yachting accident. The protagonist, Crichton, is the Earl of Loam's capable and intelligent butler whose skills and ability to adapt enable the party to survive. As the group is removed from the strictures of the class system and the rules of their society, Crichton replaces the Earl of Loam as the island's natural leader. In the play, Crichton demonstrates various skills, from hunting and fishing to constructing shelters and forging tools. Despite his impressive attributes and abilities, he remains committed to the societal norms that mandate servant and master relationships and insists on addressing the others as \\"my lord\\" or \\"my lady.\\" When the group is eventually rescued, the social order is restored, and Crichton returns to his role as the Earl's butler, without any acknowledgment of his leadership during their time on the island. Over the years, \\"The Admirable Crichton\\" has been adapted into films and television shows, with various actors taking on the role of the resourceful and skilled butler. The play remains an essential work in Barrie's oeuvre and continues to be studied and performed today for its commentary and wit."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The film follows a group of friends grasping for a spectacular night of partying, only to be confronted with catastrophe after catastrophe. The humor is as utterly predictable as the next Earth-shaking disaster, with characters so flat they may as well be screen-printed on the viewer's retinas.

Please answer the following question: What is the last name of person whose ancestral home was denied to her through agnatic primogeniture?  Answer the above question based on the context below:  Vita Sackville-West, poet, author, and gardener, was born at Knole, about 25 miles from Sissinghurst, on 9 March 1892. The great Elizabethan mansion, home of her ancestors but denied to her through agnatic primogeniture, held enormous importance for her throughout her life. Sissinghurst was a substitute for Knole, and she greatly valued its familial connections. In 1913 Sackville-West married Harold Nicolson, a diplomat at the start of his career. Their relationship was unconventional, with both pursuing multiple, mainly same-sex, affairs. After breaking with her lover Violet Trefusis in 1921, Sackville-West became increasingly withdrawn. She wrote to her mother that she would like \\"to live alone in a tower with her books\\", an ambition she achieved in the tower at Sissinghurst where only her dogs were regularly admitted. From 1946 until a few years before her death, Sackville-West wrote a gardening column for The Observer, in which, although she never referred directly to Sissinghurst, she discussed a wide array of horticultural issues. In an article, \\"Some Flowers\\", she discussed the challenge of writing effectively about flowers: \\"I discovered this only when I started to do so. Before ... I found myself losing my temper with the nauseating phraseology ... and sickly vocabulary employed.\\" In 1955, in recognition of her achievement at Sissinghurst, \\"bending some stubborn acres to my will\\", she was awarded the Royal Horticultural Society's Veitch Medal. Her biographer Victoria Glendinning considers Sissinghurst to be Sackville-West's \\"one magnificent act of creation\\". Answer:","output":"The last name of the person whose ancestral home was denied to her through agnatic primogeniture is Sackville-West.

Taste the food often, until the tart flavor of the food is reduced. Baking soda is sodium bicarbonate, which is a form of salt.","output":"This alkali compound helps to neutralize the acidic elements in your dish, making the overall taste more balanced and palatable. However, it is essential to practice moderation when using baking soda in cooking, as too much of it can result in a soapy or metallic taste, as well as increase the dish's overall sodium content. Additionally, baking soda can alter the color and texture of certain ingredients, particularly fruits and vegetables, so it is advisable to apply this technique with careful consideration. In some cases, you may also choose to combine other methods of reducing acidity alongside the use of baking soda, such as incorporating sweeteners or dairy products to the dish. These complementary ingredients can help mellow out the sharp tang, enhance the flavor profile, and contribute to a more harmonious taste experience.

Question: how does sedimentary rock form Suggestion: Sedimentary rocks are only a thin veneer over a crust consisting mainly of igneous and metamorphic rocks . The answer to this question is:","output":"False. The suggested answer does not provide a direct explanation of how sedimentary rock forms. Here is a more appropriate and detailed answer: Sedimentary rocks form from the accumulation, compaction, and cementation of mineral and organic particles, which are typically derived from the weathering and erosion of pre-existing rocks. These particles, known as sediment, are transported by wind, water, and ice, and eventually deposited in locations such as riverbanks, lakes, and oceans. Over time, the layers of sediment become buried beneath more sediment, which leads to the compaction of the material under the weight of the overlying layers. The process of cementation then takes place when minerals, such as silica or calcite, precipitate and fill the spaces between the sediment particles, effectively binding them together to form solid rock. This entire process is known as lithification. While it is correct that sedimentary rocks often overlie crust consisting mainly of igneous and metamorphic rocks, this statement does not directly explain how sedimentary rocks actually form, which was the core question."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Would the following sentence, by the strictest standards, be considered correct by a linguist? They rowed.","output":"Yes, the sentence \\"They rowed.\\" can be considered correct by the strictest standards of a linguist. Let's break down the elements of this sentence to understand its correctness from a linguistic point of view: 1. Subject: \\"They\\" is a pronoun functioning as the subject of the sentence. \\"They\\" is the plural third person pronoun in English and can refer to a group of people or things. The usage of a subject is crucial in most sentences to indicate who or what the sentence is about, and \\"They\\" fulfills that criterion here. 2. Verb: \\"rowed\\" is the past tense of the verb \\"to row.\\" The verb is essential in conveying the action or state within a sentence. In this case, the action of rowing a boat, which is understood to have taken place in the past, is expressed using the past tense form \\"rowed.\\" The verb agrees with the subject (a plural pronoun) in both tense and number, making it grammatically correct. 3. Sentence structure: The sentence has a simple structure: one subject and one verb. It conveys a complete thought, even if it does not explicitly mention when, where, or how the rowing occurred. As a complete sentence, it can stand alone and still convey meaning. 4. Punctuation: The sentence is punctuated correctly with a period at the end. A period signifies the end of a complete thought and indicates that there is no more information to be gleaned from the sentence. Since this sentence consists of a subject and verb and conveys a complete idea, the period is appropriate. 5. Clarity: Although the sentence is brief, it conveys a clear action performed by the subject. The subject and verb are appropriate for each other, and there is no ambiguity in the meaning of the sentence. 6. No errors: The sentence does not contain any apparent grammatical, spelling, or punctuation errors. Considering all these points, a linguist would likely consider \\"They rowed.\\" to be correct, even by the strictest of standards. Despite its brevity, the sentence adheres to the guidelines of proper English grammar and usage, with no mistakes or ambiguity present."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

It is awarded for gallantry \\"in the face of the enemy\\" to members of the British armed forces. It may be awarded posthumously. It was previously awarded to Commonwealth countries, most of which have established their own honours systems and no longer recommend British honours. It may be awarded to a person of any military rank in any service and to civilians under military command although no civilian has received the award since 1879. Since the first awards were presented by Queen Victoria in 1857, two thirds of all awards have been personally presented by the British monarch. These investitures are usually held at Buckingham Palace.  - Victoria (Alexandrina Victoria; 24 May 1819  22 January 1901) was Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland from 20 June 1837 until her death. From 1 May 1876, she adopted the additional title of Empress of India.  - Buckingham Palace is the London residence and administrative headquarters of the reigning monarch of the United Kingdom. Located in the City of Westminster, the palace is often at the centre of state occasions and royal hospitality. It has been a focal point for the British people at times of national rejoicing and mourning.  - Military ranks are a system of hierarchical relationships in armed forces, police, intelligence agencies or other institutions organized along military lines. Usually, uniforms denote the bearer's rank by particular insignia affixed to the uniforms. Ranking systems have been known for most of military history to be advantageous for military operations, in particular with regards to logistics, command, and coordination; as time continued and military operations became larger and more complex, military ranks increased and ranking systems themselves became more complex.  - John Grant Malcolmson VC MVO ( 9 February 1835 -- 14 August 1902 ) was a Scottish recipient of the Victoria Cross , the highest and most prestigious award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces .

Then the mother giraffe rudely introduces its children to the reality  of life. In his book,A View from the Zoo, Gary Richmond describes how a new-born giraffe learns its first lesson. The mother giraffe lowers her head long enough to take a quick look. Then she puts herself directly over her child. She waits for about a minute, and then she does the most unreasonable  thing. She throws her long leg and kicks her baby, so that it's sent sprawling . When it doesn't get up, the process is repeated again and again. The struggle to rise is important. As the baby giraffe grows tired, the mother kicks it again. Finally, it stands for the first time on its shaky  legs. Then the mother giraffe kicks it off its feet again. Why? She wants it to remember how it got up. In the wild, a baby giraffe must be able to get up as quickly as possible to stay with its group, where there's safety.

Cardinal Sean Brady must go India is crisscrossed by schools and other institutions run by Jesuits. Yet thanks to India’s dodgy editorial class very few in India know that the Vatican has paid out close to a hundred million dollars to compensate for victims of child sexual abuse by albeit “a small minority” of priests. The Indian media has barely reported that story. Was the media’s heinous silence an act of concern for Indian children or a hideously wrongheaded act of leaving well enough alone ? Abuse of power often happens in plain sight, since to the “busy,busy, busy” lay person, the powerful appear glamorous and formidable and their prey appear to be in many ways, asking for it. Since the past two decades, the Government of India, the Government of my own state, Andhra Pradesh, the Andhra Pradesh High Court , the Chief Information Commissioner and State Information Commissioner have combined to impress on me that what works in India is what I have called the “patronage paradigm” ? the paradigm of shoddiness, irresponsibility, cronyism and corruption” – and that ideas of the rule of law and democratic processes are merely spectacles to lull the gullible. I have been denied the recognition that were commended to me by one former Chief Minister of my state, one former minister of home affairs, one speaker of the Lok Sabha, several prominent ministers of the central cabinet, eminent intellectuals and freedom fighters. I have been unable to earn a decent living. The office of the Governor of Andhra Pradesh incited my neighbours to cut off my water supply. The Indian editorial class published government spin and ostentatiously made me a “non person”. The information commissions in the state and at the centre denied me my right to information on spurious, brazenly illegal grounds and punished me for daring to object. The high court denied me my right to competent counsel and punished me for complaining. Even as we speak, Dr Manmohan Singh”s office, “Daredevil” Pratibha Patil’s Rashtrapati Bhavan, Chief Information Commissioner Wajahat Habibullah, State Information Commissioner CD Arha are all locked in a most perverse and ignominious conspiracy of silence to deny me justice. Even as the Prime Minister’s Office maintains a guilty silence in my case, it appears to have jumped through hoops to heap honour on a businessman alleged to be a serial swindler. What about “civil society” in India ? Since close to a year now, I have written to the Commonwealth Human Rights Initiative, Campaign for Judicial Accountability And Reform, Forum For Judicial Accountability, MKSS (Aruna Roy) and Anna Hazare regarding this cascading delinquency of constitutional bodies in India. There has not been one constructive response. They all appear to be in helpless denial of the awful truth that an innocent citizen has been hounded and humiliated since two decades, not for any bad behaviour or wrongdoing, but for resisting the dilution of the values of the Indian constitution and standing up for the correct administration of the Right To Information Act 2005.

In this case, the best interpretation of the woman's statement would be that she does not agree with the man's assertion about the ease of finding accommodation in Britain. It seems that her own experience has been more challenging, and she could be suggesting that the man's claim might be an exaggeration or not representative of the average person's struggle.

The Swiss took just 58 minutes to beat his out-of-sorts Czech opponent 6-1, 6-1 and go top of Group A, with world No 1 Novak Djokovic and US Open champion Marin Cilic due to face off later on Monday night. Wawrinka had arrived here having won just one of his last five matches but there was no sign of that recent poor form as he earned an early break in the second game with a nervy Berdych firing a forehand wide. Stanislas Wawrinka of Switzerland capitalised on a nervy Tomas Berdych to start his campaign in style. Berdych, of the Czech Republic, has not won any of his opening matches at the O2 Arena in London. Berdych has never won his opening match at the O2 Arena and it quickly looked to be heading that way again as a deep return by Wawrinka secured the double break for 4-0. Wawrinka had a set point for a first-serve bagel but Berdych saved with an ace and finally got on the board, before Wawrinka held to wrap up the first set in just 25 minutes. Things got no better for Berdych in the second set as a lengthy third game ended with Wawrinka claiming the break courtesy of his trademark one-handed backhand which was too powerful for Berdych to get back. Wawrinka's victory earned him 200 ranking points as he fightsto keep his place in the world top four. Wawrinka then reeled off the next four games in quick succession to clinch victory, as well as 200 ranking points which will prove handy as he bids to retain his place in the world's top four. Wawrinka said: 'I didn't expect to win that easy in the score, for sure. But I was ready to play well. 'I had a great week of preparation. I worked really, really hard [in the last] few weeks with Magnus [Norman, his coach]. 'Even if the result wasn't there in Basel and Paris, I was feeling the ball really well on the practice court.' The good news for Czech fans is that Berdych has always gone on to win his second match at the ATP World Tour Finals, but the world No 7 will have to drastically improve in his next match on Wednesday if he is to continue that particular streak. Berdych said: 'Unfortunately it was my worst match of the season and I kept it for the start here in the World Tour Finals.'

Blake was born on January 18, 1970 in Compton, California. He was chiefly inspired by funk and soul artists, such as Roger Troutman (who even taught him the use of the talkbox, which became a trademark for Quik's sound throughout his career) and George Clinton. Out of respect for his beloved friend, Roger Troutman, he retired the talkbox. David's love for music began at 2, as his mother had an extensive record collection. Before recording Safe + Sound, DJ Quik had previously scrapped an album, which he said was so horrible that he had to smash the masters.  As DJ Quik began to work on his third album, he started working with Suge Knight again. Their relationship dates back to 1988, before he sought refuge with a major label. He was signed to Suge's independent label Funky Enough Records in 1988. The arrangement proved to be short lived. They linked up again in 1993 for another short lived arrangement.  His third album Safe + Sound, released in 1995, made number 14 on the Billboard 200. It featured friends 2nd II None, Kam, Playa Hamm and Hi-C. The album features the singles \\"Dollaz & Sense\\" and \\"Safe + Sound\\". During the process of the album, Quik was feuding with rapper MC Eiht from Compton's Most Wanted and long time friend AMG. Today, he is on good terms with MC Eiht. Safe + Sound saw Suge being the executive producer. His relationship with Suge led him to produce some of the tracks on Above The Rim, Murder Was The Case, All Eyez On Me, Until the End of Time, Better Dayz and It's About Time and was on Death Row Records for a short period but never released an album while on the label. He also produced a 2nd II None album for Death Row Records, which was never released.  Quik played a part on the 2Pac album All Eyez On Me, though he is only credited for producing \\"Heartz of Men\\" on that album (in the credits he used his real name, David Blake, because he was under contract to Profile). He also did additional production and mixed half the album in over two days. Quik made another uncredited appearance on a song with 2Pac named \\"Thug Passion\\". He also produced on the albums Dogg Food and Tha Doggfather, although he received no credit. DJ Quik later went to say that he had some of the best times of his life when he worked with the label.","output":"This text is about David Blake, better known by his stage name DJ Quik, a rapper, songwriter, and record producer from Compton, California."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: Hillary Diane Rodham Clinton (; born October 26, 1947) is an American politician who was the First Lady of the United States from 1993 to 2001, and served as the junior U.S. Senator from New York from 2001 to 2009 and 67th United States Secretary of State from 2009 to 2013. In 2008, she sought and lost the Democratic Party's nomination for President of the United States to then-Senator Barack Obama. She became the Democratic Party's nominee for President of the United States in the 2016 election. Context: Hillary Diane Rodham was born on October 26, 1947, at Edgewater Hospital in Chicago, Illinois. Clinton was raised in a United Methodist family that first lived in Chicago. When she was three years old, her family moved to the Chicago suburb of Park Ridge. Her father, Hugh Rodham, was of English and Welsh descent, and managed a small but successful textile business. Her mother, Dorothy Howell, was a homemaker of Dutch, English, French Canadian (from Quebec), Scottish and Welsh descent. Clinton has two younger brothers, Hugh and Tony.  As a child, Rodham was a favorite student among her teachers at the public schools that she attended in Park Ridge. She participated swimming and softball and earned numerous badges as a Brownie and a Girl Scout. She has often told a story of being inspired by U.S. efforts during the Space Race and sending a letter to NASA around 1961 asking what she could do to become an astronaut, only to be informed that women were not being accepted into the program. She attended Maine East High School, where she participated in the student council, the school newspaper and was selected for the National Honor Society. She was elected class vice president for her junior year, but then lost the election for class president for her senior year against two boys, one of whom told her that \\"you are really stupid if you think a girl can be elected president\\". For her senior year, she and other students were transferred to the then new Maine South High School, where she was a National Merit Finalist and was voted, \\"most likely to succeed\\". She graduated in 1965 in the top five percent of her class.  Rodham's mother wanted her to have an independent, professional career, and her father, who was otherwise a traditionalist, felt that his daughter's abilities and opportunities should not be limited by gender. Rodham was raised in a politically conservative household, and she helped canvass Chicago's South Side at age 13 after the very close 1960 U.S. presidential election. She saw evidence of electoral fraud (such as voting list entries showing addresses that were empty lots) against Republican candidate Richard Nixon, and later volunteered to campaign for Republican candidate Barry Goldwater in the U.S. presidential election of 1964. Rodham's early political development was shaped most by her high school history teacher (like her father, a fervent anti-communist), who introduced her to Goldwater's The Conscience of a Conservative and by her Methodist youth minister (like her mother, concerned with issues of social justice), with whom she saw and afterwards briefly met, civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. at a 1962 speech in Chicago's Orchestra Hall.

INSTANT COLOUR TV In 1962 there was only one TV channel in Sweden, and it broadcast in black and white.The station's technical expert, Kjell Stensson, appeared on the news to announce that thanks to a newly developed technology, all viewers could now quickly and easily transform their existing sets to display colour reception.All they had to do was pull a nylon stocking over their TV screen, and they would begin to see their favorite shows in color.Reportedly, hundreds of thousands of people were taken in.Actual color TV transmission only started to appear in Sweden on April 1, 1970. SAN ERRIFFE In 1977 the British newspaper The Guardian published a special seven-page supplement  in honor of the tenth anniversary of San Serriffe, a small republic located in the Indian Ocean.A series of articles affectionately described the geography and culture of this unknown nation.The Guardian's phones rang all day as readers asked for more information about the beautiful holiday spot.Few noticed that everything about the island was made up. NIXON FOR PRESIDENT In 1992 American National Public Radio's Talk of the Nation program announced that Richard Nixon, in a surprise move, was running for President again.His new campaign slogan was, \\"I didn't do anything wrong, and I won't do it again.\\" Accompanying this announcement were audio clips of Nixon delivering his election speech.Listeners responded immediately to the announcement, flooding the show with calls expressing shock and anger.Only during the second half of the show did the host John Hockenberry reveal that the announcement was a practical joke, Nixon's voice was copied by comedian Rich Little. Question: What can be inferred from the text about Color TV? Yes or no, is the answer \\"The Swedish People didn't watch color TVs until 1970.\\"?","output":"From the text, it can be inferred that color TV was not widely available in Sweden until 1970.

Question 1: A can finish a work in 18 days and B can do the same work in 15 days. B worked for 10 days and left the job. In how many days A alone can finish the remaining work? To solve this question, let's calculate: 1. Work done by A in a day. 2. Work done by B in a day. 3. Work done by B in 10 days. 4. Remaining work. 5. Number of days required for A to complete the remaining work.  Question 2: 20 workers can finish a work in 30 days. After how many days should 5 workers leave the job so the work is completed in 35 days? To solve this question, let's follow these steps: 1. Calculate work done by 20 workers in a day. 2. Calculate work done by 15 workers in a day. 3. Determine total work. 4. Calculate work done by 20 workers in x days. 5. Calculate work done by 15 workers in the remaining 35 - x days. 6. Determine the equation that shows the relationship between the work done by each group of workers and how many days it took, and solve for x. Upon analyzing both questions, we can conclude that they do not have the same meaning. The first question involves two people with different work efficiency, and we have to find out the remaining work completion time by one person. In contrast, the second question involves a group of workers and finding the optimal time for decreasing the workforce from 20 to 15 while still completing the work in a specific period."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the above question based on the context below:  The one-act opera genre had become increasingly popular in Italy following the 1890 competition sponsored by publisher Edoardo Sonzogno for the best such work, which was won by the young Pietro Mascagni's Cavalleria rusticana. With Tosca essentially completed by November 1899, Puccini sought a new project. Among sources he considered, before proceeding with Madama Butterfly, were three works by French dramatist Alphonse Daudet that Puccini thought might be made into a trilogy of one-act operas.After Butterfly premiered in 1904, Puccini again had difficulty finding a new subject. He further considered the idea of composing three one-act operas to be performed together, but found his publisher, Giulio Ricordi, firmly opposed to such a project, convinced that it would be expensive to cast and produce. The composer then planned to work with his longtime librettist, Giuseppe Giacosa, on an opera about Marie Antoinette, a project frustrated by the librettist's illness. Puccini wrote in November 1905, \\"Will we go back to it? [Maria Antonietta] If I find three one-act works that suit me, I'll put off M.A.\\"  Puccini pursued neither project, as Giacosa's illness led to his death in September 1906.In March 1907, Puccini wrote to Carlo Clausetti, Ricordi's representative in Naples, proposing three one-act operas based on scenes from stories by Russian novelist Maxim Gorky. By May the composer had set aside this proposal to concentrate on the project which became La fanciulla del West, although he did not wholly abandon the idea of a multiple-opera evening. His next idea in this vein, some years later, was for a two-opera bill, one tragic and one comic; he later expanded this to include a third opera with a mystic or religious tone. By November 1916 Puccini had completed the \\"tragic\\" element, which became Il tabarro, but he still lacked ideas for the other two works. He considered staging Il tabarro in combination with his own early work Le Villi, or with other two-act operas which might be used to round out the evening's...

Should I validate this answer?","output":"It seems like there is some confusion in the provided answer regarding the light-independent reactions of photosynthesis and the different types of photosynthesis strategies. I'll help clarify and provide a more accurate answer: Light-independent reactions, also known as the Calvin cycle or dark reactions, occur within the chloroplasts of a plant cell after the light-dependent reactions have produced ATP and NADPH. The main purpose of the light-independent reactions is to use the energy from ATP and NADPH to fix atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) into an organic molecule, ultimately producing glucose or other sugars that the plant can use for growth and other metabolic processes. The different types of photosynthesis strategies (C3, C4, and CAM) primarily refer to different mechanisms of carbon fixation and how plants handle CO2 uptake and its incorporation into organic molecules. 1. C3 plants: These plants use the enzyme RuBisCO to attach CO2 to a five-carbon sugar (RuBP) in the stroma of the chloroplast. The resulting compound is then split into two three-carbon molecules, phosphoglycerate (PGA), which is then subjected to the Calvin cycle in order to produce glucose. 2. C4 plants: This type of photosynthesis is an adaptation to deal with higher temperatures and low CO2 concentrations. In the C4 pathway, plants initially fix CO2 into a 4-carbon compound with the help of the enzyme PEP carboxylase. This compound is shuttled to specialized cells called bundle sheath cells, where it is decarboxylated, releasing CO2, which is then fixed again by RuBisCO in a C3-like Calvin cycle. 3. CAM plants: These plants primarily grow in arid environments where water conservation is crucial. They use a similar mechanism to C4 plants for carbon fixation by initially fixating CO2 using PEP carboxylase into a 4-carbon compound, which is then converted to malic acid. However, unlike C4 plants, CAM plants perform this process at night when stomata are open, and store the malic acid in their vacuoles. During the day, when the stomata are closed to conserve water, the malic acid is released, decarboxylated to release CO2, and then the Calvin cycle proceeds as in C3 plants. In conclusion, the light-independent reactions in photosynthesis, or the Calvin cycle, generally occur the same way across these types of photosynthesis strategies. The main difference between C3, C4, and CAM plants lies in their specific methods of handling carbon dioxide, which are adaptations to different environmental conditions."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

They are approached by two suspicious black youths after Sherman gets out of the car to move a tire placed purposely in the middle of the road. Sherman jumps back into the car and Maria guns the engine in reverse, running over one of the teenagers and putting him in a coma. The two drive away and decide not to report the accident to the police. Meanwhile, indigent alcoholic journalist Peter Fallow (Bruce Willis), anxious for a story to make good with his editor, comes upon the hit-and-run case as a rallying point for the black community calling upon Jewish district attorney Abe Weiss (F. Murray Abraham), who is the Bronx District Attorney seeking re-election. According to Judge Leonard White (Morgan Freeman), almost all of DA Weiss' prosecutions end up with black and Puerto Rican defendants going to prison and Weiss is seeking a white defendant for purposes of convincing the minority-majority community that he is worth re-electing. Weiss recognizes the press coverage inherent in prosecuting the callow Sherman, who has been discovered as the hit-and-run driver, in order to cultivate the image as an avenger for the minorities and be propelled to the mayorship of New York City. As Sherman is brought to his knees, New York City fragments into different factions who use the case to suit their own cynical purposes. Finally, Sherman is left without any allies to support him except for the sympathetic Judge Leonard White and the remorseful Fallow.

A commemorative plaque was first dedicated there in 1957. The site is now occupied by 1500 Broadway, which houses offices, retail, and ABC Studios. He was the son of Irish immigrant actor James O'Neill and Mary Ellen Quinlan, who was also of Irish descent. O'Neill was married to Kathleen Jenkins from October 2, 1909 to 1912, during which time they had one son, Eugene O'Neill, Jr. (1910-1950). In 1917, O'Neill met Agnes Boulton, a successful writer of commercial fiction, and they married on April 12, 1918. They lived in a home owned by her parents in Point Pleasant, New Jersey, after their marriage. The years of their marriage--during which the couple lived in Connecticut and Bermuda and had two children, Shane and Oona--are described vividly in her 1958 memoir Part of a Long Story. They divorced in 1929, after O'Neill abandoned Boulton and the children for the actress Carlotta Monterey (born San Francisco, California, December 28, 1888; died Westwood, New Jersey, November 18, 1970). O'Neill and Carlotta married less than a month after he officially divorced his previous wife.  In 1929, O'Neill and Monterey moved to the Loire Valley in central France, where they lived in the Chateau du Plessis in Saint-Antoine-du-Rocher, Indre-et-Loire. During the early 1930s they returned to the United States and lived in Sea Island, Georgia, at a house called Casa Genotta. He moved to Danville, California in 1937 and lived there until 1944. His house there, Tao House, is today the Eugene O'Neill National Historic Site.  In their first years together, Monterey organized O'Neill's life, enabling him to devote himself to writing. She later became addicted to potassium bromide, and the marriage deteriorated, resulting in a number of separations, although they never divorced.  In 1943, O'Neill disowned his daughter Oona for marrying the English actor, director, and producer Charlie Chaplin when she was 18 and Chaplin was 54. He never saw Oona again.  He also had distant relationships with his sons. Eugene O'Neill, Jr., a Yale classicist, suffered from alcoholism and committed suicide in 1950 at the age of 40. Shane O'Neill became a heroin addict and moved into the family home in Bermuda, Spithead, with his new wife, where he supported himself by selling off the furnishings. He was disowned by his father before also committing suicide (by jumping out of a window) a number of years later. Oona ultimately inherited Spithead and the connected estate (subsequently known as the Chaplin Estate). In 1950 O'Neill joined The Lambs, the famed theater club.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: What became of Shane after his addiction?","output":"Shane O'Neill became a heroin addict and after moving into the family home in Bermuda with his new wife, he supported himself by selling off the furnishings.

Background: The Academy Juvenile Award, also known as the Juvenile Oscar, was a Special Honorary Academy Award bestowed at the discretion of the Board of Governors of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to specifically recognize juvenile performers under the age of eighteen for their \\"outstanding contributions to screen entertainment\\". The trophy itself was a miniature Oscar statuette which stood approximately 7 inches tall. The honor was first awarded by the Academy in 1935 to 6-year-old Shirley Temple for her work in 1934. The Award continued to be presented intermittently over the next 25 years until 1961, when 14-year-old Hayley Mills became the last recipient to be awarded the child-size statuette for her role in Pollyanna. Context: Judy Garland had reportedly lost her award over the years, and in June 1958 contacted the Academy to obtain a replacement at her own expense. The Academy obliged, but asked Garland to sign its well-known right of first refusal agreement covering the duplicate Oscar as well as her original, should it ever turn up. The agreement, put into implementation by the Academy in 1950, states that Oscar recipients or their heirs who want to sell their statuettes must first offer the Academy the opportunity to buy the Oscar back for the sum of 10. (An amount which was subsequently dropped to 1 in the 1980s.)  After her death in 1969, many of Garland's personal effects came into the possession of her former husband, Sidney Luft who attempted to sell a miniature Oscar statuette at a Christie's auction in 1993. Upon learning of the impending auction, the Academy quickly filed a legal injunction to halt the sale of the Award and, after some research, determined that the statuette in question was Garland's 1958 replacement Oscar, using photographs that showed the original 1940 statuette's unique base differed from the one being put up for auction. The courts ruled in the Academy's favor in 1995 and ordered Luft to return the 1958 statuette to the Academy; prompting Luft to instead turn the award over to daughter Lorna Luft who had expressed a desire to keep it in the family.  In 2000, a second statuette was put up for auction, which the Academy determined this time to be Garland's long-lost \\"original\\" 1940 Oscar. After once again tracing the auction back to Sidney Luft, the Academy again took legal action to halt the sale claiming the 1940 statuette fell under the terms of the agreement Garland had signed in 1958. The Academy again won its lawsuit in 2002 and Luft was ordered to turn the 1940 statuette over to the Academy. In February 2010, Garland's original 1940 Juvenile Oscar was put on display to the public at an exhibit held by the Academy in New York City called \\"Meet The Oscars\\". As of 2011, its 1958 replacement is believed to still be in the possession of Garland's youngest daughter, Lorna Luft. Question: What was the Lost Garland Award? Answer:","output":"The Lost Garland Award was a special Oscar trophy given to Judy Garland when she was young for her great acting in movies. It was called \\"lost\\" because, over time, Judy Garland could not find her original award and asked for a new one, which she got in 1958. Later, after she passed away, her original award from 1940 showed up in an auction by her former husband, Sidney Luft. The people who give the Oscars said it couldn't be sold and they won the case in court to stop the sale. Both original and replacement awards ended up with the Oscars' people and with Judy Garland's family."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

While Bill used insecticides to control the aphids on his farm, Paul did not use any insecticides for the same purpose. It is stated in the question that one of the farmers didn't use a strong water jet to kill aphids. Based on the information provided, we cannot conclusively determine which of the farmers, Bill or Paul, didn't use the strong water jet method for controlling aphids. There is no information provided about their specific methods beyond the fact that Bill used insecticides and Paul did not. It is important to note that using a strong water jet to kill aphids is one of the non-chemical methods for aphid control. This technique involves using water pressure to dislodge the aphids from the plants, making it difficult for them to return and causing many of them to die in the process. This approach can be useful for small-scale aphid control, such as in home gardens, but may not be as effective for large-scale farming operations. However, based on the given information, it would be reasonable to assume that Paul might be more likely to use non-chemical methods like the strong water jet, since he avoided using insecticides. Nonetheless, the specific choice of method for each farmer could involve various factors such as their personal preference, prior experience, or even the type of plants they grow. In conclusion, while we cannot definitively answer which farmer didn't use a strong water jet to kill aphids based on the information provided, it is more likely that Bill, who used insecticides for aphid control, didn't use the strong water jet method, while Paul, who didn't use insecticides, might have chosen this method, given that he might be more open to non-chemical methods of control.

The bear seemed delighted at the honey, and its eyes sparkled with curiosity and excitement. As the bear carefully sniffed the container of honey and put its paw inside, the thick, golden liquid stuck to its fur, creating a messy sight. We realized we had a unique opportunity to form a bond with this magnificent creature by offering something irresistible and responding to its immediate needs. Seeing the bear enjoy the honey reminded us of the simple pleasures that nature provides and the importance of respecting the wild animals that roamed the forests. However, it got us thinking about the broader ecosystem and the role humans played in it. The bear, which had previously been roaming the woods searching for sources of nutrition, might have been weakened by a diminishing food supply caused by human activities, such as deforestation and pollution. The water supply, which we originally planned to offer the bear, could have been compromised as well by similar factors. Watching the bear meticulously savor every drop of honey, we marveled at the adaptability of these creatures in an ever-changing environment. They had learned to seek alternative food sources and navigate the challenges they faced, with their keen senses and powerful bodies. It was a process of constant learning and adaptation, driven by the desire to survive and thrive in a complex world. As we observed the bear, we couldn't help but feel a sense of responsibility towards the conservation of their habitat. The importance of protecting these animals and the environment they depend on became clearer than ever. We realized that our actions, both individually and collectively, had tremendous consequences for the natural world and all the living beings that inhabit it. In that moment, standing beside the honey-covered bear, we became more aware of our role in the global ecosystem. We stood in awe of the strength and grace of this wild animal, but also of the vulnerability that surrounded it. Our newfound insight into the delicate balance of life was a call to action that could no longer be ignored. We resolved to become advocates for the environment and its inhabitants, dedicating ourselves to the conservation and preservation of wildlife and their habitats. The lessons we learned from the bear, coupled with the knowledge of our own power to make a difference, fueled us with passion and determination. We began by raising awareness about the importance of protecting these animals and their environments, through social media campaigns, community events, educational initiatives, and collaboration with local wildlife shelters. In time, our efforts grew into a movement that inspired others to join us in our quest to ensure a brighter, more sustainable future for all living creatures. And so, the encounter with the bear changed us fundamentally, opening our eyes to the profound interconnectedness of all life. It was a reminder that even a simple act of kindness, such as offering honey instead of water, could inspire a cascade of positive change that extended far beyond that one interaction. As we continue our mission to protect and conserve the natural world, we carry with us the memory of the bear as a symbol of the delicate balance between human beings and the environment. It serves as a constant reminder of our responsibility to one another and to the vibrant, diverse, and awe-inspiring tapestry of life that we share this planet with."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

( who wants parents hovering around the party, sniffing everyone's paper cups? )  Decide when you want to have the party.","output":"After deciding when you want to have the party, the most logical next event would be planning and organizing the party. Here's a detailed step-by-step guide to help you throw a memorable casual spring break party for teens: 1. Create a guest list: Determine the number of guests you'd like to invite to the party. It's essential to consider the size of your venue and ensure that you don't invite too many people, leading to overcrowding. To keep the party casual, inviting close friends and classmates is the best way to go. 2. Choose a theme: Select a fun and casual theme for your spring break party that appeals to the interests and preferences of your guests. Themes may include a beach party, a Hawaiian luau, a glow-in-the-dark party, or an '80s retro costume party. Choosing a theme will help you decide on decorations, activities, and dress code. 3. Plan the budget: Based on the number of guests and the type of party you're planning, come up with a realistic budget that covers essential party expenses (such as food, drinks, decorations, entertainment, and possible rentals). 4. Send out invitations: Create simple and attractive invitations for your guests. You can either hand them out in person, send them by mail, or use digital platforms such as social media or messenger apps to send the invites. Be sure to include necessary information such as date, time, location, theme, and RSVP details. 5. Plan food and beverages: Choose casual and easy-to-eat food items that cater to different dietary preferences. A variety of finger foods, snacks, and desserts would be ideal. For beverages, provide options such as soda, punch, lemonade, and water. Avoid serving alcoholic beverages since it's a party for teens. 6. Organize entertainment and activities: Make sure there is enough entertainment for your guests to enjoy during the party. You can include music, games, and even hire a DJ if the budget allows. Plan a few fun activities and games that follow your chosen theme, such as a limbo contest for a Hawaiian luau or a costume contest for an '80s retro party. 7. Prepare the venue: Set up the party venue by decorating according to your chosen theme. Arrange adequate seating, create areas for socializing, dancing, and food. Make sure everything is clean and organized before the guests arrive. 8. Set up a photo booth or designated picture-taking spot: Provide a designated area for guests to take pictures, with some fun props and a backdrop consistent with your theme. This will allow guests to capture fun memories from the party. 9. Have a plan for clean-up: Once the party is over, clean-up is necessary. Enlist the help of friends or family members to make this process smoother and more efficient. 10. Enjoy the party: With all the planning and organizing completed, the most crucial element is to enjoy the party and ensure that everyone is having a good time. By being a welcoming and attentive host, you can create a memorable casual spring break party for your friends and yourself. In conclusion, after deciding when to have the party, the most logical next event is to plan and organize it effectively by creating a guest list, choosing a theme, managing the budget, sending out invitations, arranging food and beverages, organizing entertainment and activities, preparing the venue, and setting up a photo booth. Once everything is set up, enjoy the party and make lasting memories with your friends."},{"instruction":"Q: Which glands sit atop the kidneys and are composed of an outer cortex and an inner medulla, all surrounded by a connective tissue capsule?

Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: I was 35 weeks pregnant when I had my stroke. For weeks prior to the event I kept experiencing ‘visual disturbances.’ I felt when I was reading a newspaper or book a sense that my eyes were crossing. I’d feel aware right before it would occur and I would rush to look in a mirror only to discover my eyes were not crossing. I informed my OB who blamed it on the blood vessels in my eyes enlarging due to pregnancy. Ummm ok. You know more than me. Later I was told by a surgeon what I was experiencing was ‘textbook’ for the passing of blood clots through my occipital area of the brain! The feeling would eventually subside. I awoke one morning feeling ‘kind of fuzzy’ headed. Like I had slept too hard. I sat with my husband at the kitchen table for our morning coffee and newspaper and for no reason I could imagine I was unable to swallow my coffee and it dribbled out the left side of my mouth. My husband asked me what was going on and I apparently told him, I was ‘stroking’ out. He got up from the table assuming I was OK and went off to take his morning shower. While in the shower it occurred to him something might not be right. He came back to the table where I was struggling to lift myself from the chair. I put my hands on the table to lift my body and my left hand kept sliding off the edge. He finally got behind me and tried to lift me under my arms and I crumbled to the floor. He then called my OB and told him he thought I’d had a stroke. My OB immediately expressed his doubt but my husband was advised to call an ambulance to get me to the ER. I never really experienced pain from the stroke. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

Tämä raportti kattaa erilaisia näkökulmia ja asioita, jotka on otettava huomioon, kun siirrymme yhteisvaluutta euroon. Monet näistä menettelyistä vaativat yhteistyötä ja koordinointia Euroopan unionin jäsenvaltioiden sekä komission ja Euroopan keskuspankin välillä. Tämä tarkoittaa sitä, että meidän on tehtävä tiivistä yhteistyötä ja viestintää, jotta voimme saavuttaa yhtenäisen valuutta-alueen Euroopassa.  Yksi keskeinen osa euron käyttöönottoon liittyvistä menettelyistä on jäsenvaltioiden rahapoliittinen yhdentyminen. Tämä merkitsee sitä, että jäsenvaltioiden on tarkistettava, että täyttävät kaikki euron käyttöönoton kriteerit, kuten julkisen talouden alijäämän ja velkatason. Jäsenvaltioiden on myös varmistettava, että kansallinen lainsäädäntö on yhdenmukaistettu Euroopan unionin sekundäärilainsäädännön kanssa, ja että kansalliset keskuspankit integroituvat Euroopan keskuspankkijärjestelmään.  Toinen monimutkainen menettely on kansallisten valuuttojen vaihtokurssien kiinnittäminen euroon. Tämä tarkoittaa, että jäsenvaltioiden on sovittava keskenään ja Euroopan keskuspankin kanssa niiden valuuttojen suhteellisista arvoista, jotka tullaan korvaamaan eurolla. Tämä prosessi sisältää keskeisesti myös vaihtokurssimekanismi (ERM II) -järjestelmän käyttöönoton, jonka tarkoituksena on varmistaa valuuttojen vakaus ennen euron käyttöönottoa. Kolmas monimutkainen menettely on euron fyysisten setelien ja kolikoiden tuotanto ja jakelu. Tämä vaatii merkittävää koordinointia ja yhteistyötä eri tahojen välillä, kuten Euroopan keskuspankin, kansallisten keskuspankkien ja rahapajojen. Lisäksi jäsenvaltioiden on varmistettava, että kansalaiset tietävät ja ymmärtävät euron käyttöönottoon liittyviä muutoksia, kuten valuutanvaihtoa ja uusien seteleiden ja kolikoiden tunnistamista. Näiden monimutkaisten menettelyjen lisäksi herra Langen raportti korostaa, että euron käyttöönotto edellyttää myös poliittista sitoutumista ja yhteisvastuullisuutta jäsenvaltioiden välillä. Tämä tarkoittaa sitä, että meidän on yhdessä sitouduttava euron onnistuneeseen käyttöönottoon ja sen tuomiin etuihin, kuten taloudellisen integraation syventämiseen, hintavakauden takaamiseen ja kilpailukyvyn vahvistamiseen Euroopan unionin alueella. Kokonaisuudessaan tämä raportti kuvastaa sitä, kuinka monimutkaisia ja yhteistyötä vaativia menettelyjä meidän on vielä suoritettava ennen yhteisvaluutta euron käyttöönottoa. Se korostaa myös komission, Euroopan parlamentin ja jäsenvaltioiden yhteisen ponnistuksen merkitystä tässä prosessissa, jotta voidaan taata yhtenäisen valuutta-alueen menestyksekäs luominen Euroopassa."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Use a cheesegrater to crush them;  b). Use a metal cooking mallet;","output":"To accomplish the goal of crushing garlic cloves, both methods mentioned could potentially work. However, it is essential to consider the advantages, disadvantages, and intended use of crushed garlic to decide which method makes the most sense. Below, I have provided a detailed analysis of both options: a). Using a cheesegrater Advantages: 1. Finely grated garlic: A cheesegrater, especially one with small holes, will produce finely grated garlic, which can easily be spread and incorporated into a variety of dishes. 2. Uniform distribution: The small particles created by the graters help in achieving an even distribution of garlic flavor in recipes. 3. Quick process: Cheese graters typically grate foods quickly, which will speed up the cooking process. Disadvantages: 1. Increased waste: Since the grated garlic is very small, more garlic will be stuck on the grater's surface, which can be difficult to extract and use. This leads to wastage. 2. More tedious cleaning: Graters have many nooks and crannies that can trap the garlic, making them more challenging to clean. 3. Risk of injury: By holding the garlic cloves close to a grater, you run the risk of accidentally grating your fingers as well. b). Using a metal cooking mallet Advantages: 1. Effectively crushed garlic: A metal cooking mallet can easily crush the garlic cloves, which emparts a robust flavor to the dish you are preparing. 2. Less waste: Compared to grating, using a mallet is more accurate and doesn't waste as much garlic. 3. Easier cleaning: A metal mallet is easier to clean since it has a smooth surface and no hidden compartments. 4. Additional uses: A versatile tool in the kitchen, a mallet can be used to tenderize meat, pound dough, or crack nuts, in addition to crushing garlic. Disadvantages: 1. Less uniform distribution: The crushed garlic can be uneven and chunkier, which may lead to an inconsistent flavor profile in your dish. 2. Potential mess: Since you're crushing garlic using force, there is a possibility that it could spread all over your countertop, creating a messy work area. After considering both methods, using a metal cooking mallet (option b) makes more sense to accomplish the goal of crushing garlic cloves. It is more efficient, produces less waste, and is easier to clean. While the garlic might not be as finely crushed as when using a cheesegrater, it will still effectively add flavor to your dishes. The metal cooking mallet is also a more versatile tool in your kitchen."},{"instruction":"Please answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Near the village, there is an old famous temple.

Sean John Combs was born on November 4, 1969 in Manhattan's Harlem neighborhood in New York City, and was raised in Mount Vernon, New York. His mother, Janice (Smalls), was a model and teacher's assistant, and his father, Melvin Earl Combs, served in the U.S. Air Force and was an associate of convicted New York drug dealer Frank Lucas. At age 33, Melvin was shot to death while sitting in his car on Central Park West, when Combs was 2 years old. Combs graduated from the Roman Catholic Mount Saint Michael Academy in 1987. In April 1999 Combs was charged with assault as a result of an incident with Steve Stoute of Interscope Records. Stoute was the manager for Nas, with whom Combs had filmed a video earlier that year for the song \\"Hate Me Now\\". Combs was concerned that the video, which featured a shot of Nas and Combs being crucified, was blasphemous. He asked for his scenes on the cross to be pulled, but after it aired unedited on MTV on April 15, Combs visited Stoute's offices and injured Stoute. Combs was charged with second-degree assault and criminal mischief, and was sentenced to attend a one-day anger management class.  Forever, Combs' debut solo studio album, was released by Bad Boy Records on August 24, 1999, in North America, and in the UK on the following day. It reached number two on the Billboard 200 and number one on the Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, where it remained for one week before being knocked off by Mary J. Blige's fourth album, Mary. The album received positive to mixed reviews from music critics and spawned three singles that have charted on the Billboard charts. It peaked at number four on the Canadian Albums Chart, Combs' highest-charting album in that country.  On December 27, 1999, Combs and his then-girlfriend Jennifer Lopez were at Club New York in Manhattan when gunfire broke out. After a police investigation, Combs and fellow rapper Shyne were arrested for weapons violations and other charges. Combs was charged with four weapons-related charges and bribing his driver, Wardel Fenderson, to claim ownership of his gun.  With a gag order in place, the highly publicized trial began. Combs' attorneys were Johnnie L. Cochran Jr. and Benjamin Brafman. Combs was found not guilty on all charges; Shyne was convicted on five of his eight charges and sentenced to ten years in prison. Combs and Lopez broke up shortly after. A lawsuit filed by Fenderson, who said he suffered emotional damage after the shooting, was settled in February 2004. Lawyers for both sides, having agreed to keep the settlement terms secret, said that the matter was \\"resolved to the satisfaction of all parties\\".

In the question, it's mentioned that Carla was in a car accident and lost a lot of blood. Losing blood would naturally lead to a drop in blood volume, which is one of the key factors in determining blood pressure.

Visibly in pain, he begins dictating a confession into a Dictaphone for his friend and colleague, Barton Keyes (Edward G. Robinson), a brilliant claims adjuster. The story, told primarily in flashback, ensues. Neff first meets the alluring Phyllis Dietrichson (Barbara Stanwyck) during a routine house call to remind her husband (Tom Powers) that his automobile insurance policy is up for renewal. They flirt, until Phyllis asks how she could take out an accident policy on her husband's life without his knowledge. Neff deduces she is contemplating murder, and makes it clear he wants no part of it. However, he cannot get her out of his mind, and when Phyllis shows up at his own home, he cannot resist her any longer. Neff knows all the tricks of his trade and devises a plan to make the murder of her husband appear to be an accidental fall from a train that will trigger the \\"double indemnity\\" clause and pay out twice the policy's face value. After Dietrichson breaks his leg, Phyllis drives him to the train station for his trip to Palo Alto for a college reunion. Neff is hiding in the backseat and kills Dietrichson when Phyllis turns onto a deserted side street. Then, Neff boards the train posing as Dietrichson and using his crutches. He makes his way to the last car, the observation car, and steps outside to the open platform to supposedly smoke a cigarette. A complication ensues when he meets a passenger named Jackson (Porter Hall) there, but he manages to get the man to leave. Neff then throws the crutches on the railway tracks, jumps off at a prearranged meeting spot with Phyllis, and drags Dietrichson's body onto the tracks by his crutches. Mr. Norton, the company's chief, believes the death was suicide, but Keyes scoffs at the idea, quoting statistics indicating the improbability of suicide by jumping off a slow-moving...

These sentences convey different information and have inconsistencies in the details they present. 1. The first sentence states that Anri is a character expressed in two languages: English, in which Anri is voiced by Katherine Burton, and Japanese, in which Anri is voiced by Yuko Mizutani. In this sentence, Anri is a fictional character with voice actors Yuko Mizutani and Katherine Burton providing the voiceovers for the two respective languages. 2. The second sentence claims that Yuko Mizutani is the person being voiced. It indicates that Katherine Burton provides the Japanese voiceover for Yuko Mizutani and Anri provides the English voiceover. In this scenario, Yuko Mizutani is no longer the voice actor for a character but instead becomes the subject being voiced by other voice actors in different languages. So, while the two sentences have some related elements, such as the connection among Anri, Yuko Mizutani, and Katherine Burton, they don't convey the same meaning, and therefore, they cannot be considered paraphrases.

Answer the following question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below.   Who is more likely to eat meals at the same time each day?  Jason is an average guy who goes to work each day, lives in an apartment, exercises sometimes, goes out and drinks some weekends and just generally enjoys life. Brad, however, has chosen to live in a dark cave that has no windows. He lives in a cave that has almost no light except for some candles he lights from time to time. If he needs food or supplies, he pays someone to go get them, and they slide them through a hole that can open in the steel door at the entrance of the cave.  Hint: Circadian rhythms are regular changes in biology or behavior that occur in a 24-hour cycle. In humans, for example, blood pressure and body temperature change in a regular way throughout each 24-hour day. Animals may eat and drink at certain times of day as well. Humans have daily cycles of behavior, too. Most people start to get sleepy after dark and have a hard time sleeping when it is light outside. In many species, including humans, circadian rhythms are controlled by a tiny structure called the biological clock . This structure is located in a gland at the base of the brain. The biological clock sends signals to the body. The signals cause regular changes in behavior and body processes. The amount of light entering the eyes helps control the biological clock. The clock causes changes that repeat every 24 hours. Answer:","output":"Jason is more likely to eat meals at the same time each day.  Justifying this, first, we need to look at the living conditions and lifestyle of both Jason and Brad. Jason lives in an environment where his circadian rhythm, meaning his biological clock that runs on a 24-hour cycle, is likely regulated by the natural pattern of day and night. This schedule would therefore encourage eating at regular times.  Conversely, Brad lives in a dark cave with almost no natural light. The lack of light can disrupt his circadian rhythm, possibly making his eating habits irregular as his biological clock may not align with the typical 24-hour cycle due to absence of light cues.  The paragraph also hints at the fact that circadian rhythms and the biological clock are influenced by light. Jason with his exposure to natural light is likely maintaining regular patterns including eating habits. Therefore, Jason is more likely to eat meals at the same time each day."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Before iodized salt was developed, some people experienced a number of developmental difficulties, including problems with thyroid gland function and mental retardation. In the 1920s, we learned that these conditions could usually be treated easily with the addition of iodide anion to the diet. One easy way to increase iodide intake was to add the anion to table salt. This simple step greatly enhanced health and development. Large amounts of iodide ion are also found in seaweed such as kelp (see picture above) and saltwater fish.  People from two villages ate lots of salt. People from Salt village used regular salt, while people from Sand village people used iodized salt in their diets, after talking to specialists.  Which village had fewer people experience developmental difficulties? Answer:","output":"The Sand village, which used iodized salt in their diets, would have fewer people experiencing developmental difficulties. This is because iodized salt provides the necessary iodide anion, which helps in preventing problems related to thyroid gland function and mental retardation. The addition of iodide to the diet effectively addresses iodine deficiencies and thus improves overall health and development."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Information:  - Sicyon (\\"gen\\".: ) was an ancient Greek city state situated in the northern Peloponnesus between Corinth and Achaea on the territory of the present-day regional unit of Corinthia. An ancient monarchy at the times of the Trojan War, the city was ruled by a number of tyrants during the Archaic and Classical period and became a democracy in the 3rd century BC. Sicyon was celebrated for its contributions to ancient Greek art, producing many famous painters and sculptors. In Hellenistic times it was also the home of Aratus of Sicyon, the leader of the Achaean League.  - James Loeb (August 6, 1867  May 27, 1933) was a German-born American banker, Hellenist and philanthropist.  - Greek mythology is the body of myths and teachings that belong to the ancient Greeks, concerning their gods and heroes, the nature of the world, and the origins and significance of their own cult and ritual practices. It was a part of the religion in ancient Greece. Modern scholars refer to and study the myths in an attempt to shed light on the religious and political institutions of Ancient Greece and its civilization, and to gain understanding of the nature of myth-making itself.  - Argos (Modern Greek:  ; Ancient Greek:  ) is a city in Argolis, Peloponnese, Greece and one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in the world. It is also a former bishopric and present Latin Catholic titular see. It is the biggest town in Argolis and a major center for the area. Since the 2011 local government reform it has been part of the municipality of Argos-Mykines, of which it is a municipal unit. The municipal unit has an area of 138.138 km. It is from Nafplion, which was its historic harbour. A settlement of great antiquity, Argos has been continuously inhabited as at least a substantial village for the past 7,000 years. The city is a member of the Most Ancient European Towns Network.  - Antipater of Thessalonica was the author of over a hundred epigrams in the \\"Greek Anthology\\". He is the most copious and perhaps the most interesting of the Augustan epigrammatists. He lived under the patronage of Lucius Calpurnius Piso (consul in BC 15 and then proconsul of Macedonia for several years), who appointed him governor of Thessalonica.   - Achaea or Achaia, sometimes transliterated from Greek as Akhaïa (\\"Achaïa\\"), is one of the regional units of Greece. It is part of the region of West Greece and is situated in the northwestern part of the Peloponnese peninsula. The capital is Patras. Since 2001, the population has exceeded 300,000.  - Zenobius was a Greek sophist, who taught rhetoric at Rome during the reign of Emperor Hadrian (AD 117-138).  - Aratus (271213 BC) was a statesman of the ancient Greek city-state of Sicyon and a leader of the Achaean League. He deposed the Sicyonian tyrant Nicocles in 251 BC. Aratus was an advocate of Greek unity and brought Sicyon into the Achaean League, which he led to its maximum extent. He was elected \\"strategos\\" many times and led the Achaeans against Macedonia, the Aetolians and the Spartans. After the Spartans defeated and nearly destroyed the cities of the Achaean League, he requested Antigonus Doson of Macedonia to help fight against the Aetolians and Spartans. After Antigonus died in 222 BC, Aratus did not get along with Philip V of Macedon, who wanted to make the Achaean League subject to Macedonia. Polybius and Plutarch record that Philip had Aratus poisoned.  - Sappho (Attic Greek , Aeolic Greek , \\"Psappho\\" ) (c. 630  c. 570 BC) was an archaic Greek poet from the island of Lesbos. Sappho's poetry was lyric poetry, and she is best known for her poems about love. Most of Sappho's poetry is now lost, and survives only in fragmentary form. As well as lyric poetry, three epigrams attributed to Sappho are preserved, but these are in fact Hellenistic imitations.   - Rome is a city and special \\"comune\\" (named \\"Roma Capitale\\") in Italy. Rome is the capital of Italy and of the Lazio region. With 2,870,336 residents in , it is also the country's largest and most populated \\"comune\\" and fourth-most populous city in the European Union by population within city limits. The Metropolitan City of Rome has a population of 4.3 million residents. The city is located in the central-western portion of the Italian Peninsula, within Lazio (Latium), along the shores of Tiber river. The Vatican City is an independent country geographically located within the city boundaries of Rome, the only existing example of a country within a city: for this reason Rome has been often defined as capital of two states.   - Praxilla of Sicyon ( Greek :  ) , was a Greek lyric poet of the 5th century BC. She was a contemporary of Telesilla . Antipater of Thessalonica lists her first among his canon of nine \`\` immortal - tongued '' women poets She was highly esteemed in her time . Evidence of this is shown in that Lysippus , a famous sculptor , made a bronze statue of her . In addition to this statue a vase was found with the first four words of a poem , she had written , on it . \`\` Further evidence for the reception of her work in the fifth century BC comes from the comic playwright Aristophanes , who parodied lines from her poetry both in the Wasps ( 1238 ) and the Thesmophoriazusae ( 528 ) . Not only did he know her work , but his parody implies that he expected his Athenian audience to recognize it too . '' Not much of her works survive , only eight fragments of her work . Her talents were varied , she wrote drinking songs ( scolia ) , hymns and dithyrambs ( choral odes performed at festivals of Dionysus ) . She composed a hymn to Adonis from which one fragment survives , in which Adonis , in response to a question from the shades in the underworld ( \`\` What was the most beautiful thing you left behind ? '' ) , answers : This fragment survives because Zenobius quoted it to explain the proverbial expression \`\` sillier than Praxilla 's Adonis '' ( because the inclusion of cucumbers alongside the sun and moon could seem incongruous ) .

The General Editor is Jeffrey Henderson, holder of the William Goodwin Aurelio Professorship of Greek Language and Literature at Boston University.  - Thesmophoriazusae (\\"Thesmophoriazousai\\"; meaning \\"Women Celebrating the Festival of the Thesmophoria\\", sometimes also called The Poet and the Women) is one of eleven surviving plays by Aristophanes. It was first produced in , probably at the City Dionysia. The play's focuses include the subversive role of women in a male-dominated society; the vanity of contemporary poets, such as the tragic playwrights Euripides and Agathon; and the shameless, enterprising vulgarity of an ordinary Athenian, as represented in this play by the protagonist, Mnesilochus. The work is also notable for Aristophanes' free adaptation of key structural elements of Old Comedy and for the absence of the anti-populist and anti-war comments that pepper his earlier work. It was produced in the same year as \\"Lysistrata\\", another play with sexual themes.  - In Greek mythology, the Trojan War was waged against the city of Troy by the Achaeans (Greeks) after Paris of Troy took Helen from her husband Menelaus, king of Sparta. The war is one of the most important events in Greek mythology and has been narrated through many works of Greek literature, most notably through Homer's \\"Iliad\\". The \\"Iliad\\" relates four days in the tenth year of the decade-long siege of Troy; the \\"Odyssey\\" describes the journey home of Odysseus, one of the war's heroes. Other parts of the war are described in a cycle of epic poems, which have survived through fragments. Episodes from the war provided material for Greek tragedy and other works of Greek literature, and for Roman poets including Virgil and Ovid.  - Adonis, in Greek mythology, is a central figure in various mystery religions. In 1966, Wahib Atallah wrote that the \\"cult of Adonis belonged to women\\", and further asserted \\"the cult of dying Adonis was fully developed in the circle of young girls around Sappho on Lesbos, about 600 BC, as a fragment of Sappho reveals.\\"  - The Greek Anthology is a collection of poems, mostly epigrams, that span the classical and Byzantine periods of Greek literature. Most of the material of the \\"Greek Anthology\\" comes from two manuscripts, the \\"Palatine Anthology\\" of the 10th century and the \\"Anthology of Planudes\\" (or \\"Planudean Anthology\\") of the 14th century.  - Lysistrata (or ; Attic Greek: , \\"Army Disbander\\") is a comedy by Aristophanes. Originally performed in classical Athens in 411 BC, it is a comic account of one woman's extraordinary mission to end the Peloponnesian War. Lysistrata persuades the women of Greece to withhold sexual privileges from their husbands and lovers as a means of forcing the men to negotiate peacea strategy, however, that inflames the battle between the sexes. The play is notable for being an early exposé of sexual relations in a male-dominated society. Additionally, its dramatic structure represents a shift from the conventions of Old Comedy, a trend typical of the author's career. It was produced in the same year as the \\"Thesmophoriazusae\\", another play with a focus on gender-based issues, just two years after Athens' catastrophic defeat in the Sicilian Expedition.  - The Achaean League (Greek: ), also known as the Aegean League, was a Hellenistic-era confederation of Greek city states on the northern and central Peloponnese. The first league was formed in the 5th century BC. The second Achaean League existed between 280 BC and 146 BC. The league was named after the region of Achaea.  - Telesilla (fl. 510 BC) was an ancient Greek poet, native of Argos. She was a distinguished woman who was especially renowned for her poetry and for her leadership of Argos through a political and military crisis and subsequent re-building.  - Old Comedy (\\"archaia\\") is the first period of the ancient Greek comedy, according to the canonical division by the Alexandrian grammarians. The most important Old Comic playwright is Aristophanes  whose works, with their daring political commentary and abundance of sexual innuendo, effectively define the genre today. Aristophanes satirized and lampooned the most prominent personalities and institutions of his time, as can be seen, for example, in his scurrilous portrayal of Socrates in \\"The Clouds\\", and in his racy anti-war farce \\"Lysistrata\\". Aristophanes was only one of a large number of comic poets, however, working in Athens in the late 5th century BC; his biggest rivals were Hermippus and Eupolis.  - Thesmophoria was a festival held in Greek cities, in honor of the goddesses Demeter and her daughter Persephone. The name derives from \\"thesmoi\\", or laws by which men must work the land. The Thesmophoria were the most widespread festivals and the main expression of the cult of Demeter, aside from the Eleusinian Mysteries. The Thesmophoria commemorated the third of the year when Demeter abstained from her role of goddess of the harvest and growth; spending the harsh summer months of Greece, when vegetation dies and lacks rain, in mourning for her daughter who was in the realm of the Underworld. Their distinctive feature was the sacrifice of pigs.  - Latin literature includes the essays, histories, poems, plays, and other writings written in the Latin language. Beginning around the 3rd century BC, it took two centuries to become a dominant literature of ancient Rome, with many educated Romans still reading and writing in Ancient Greek, as late as Marcus Aurelius (121180 AD). Latin literature was in many ways a continuation of Greek literature, using many of the same forms.

'Um, yeah,' Jody croaked, and started to laugh. 'Just dying of apple peel.' Dara began to laugh too. Looking at the little pile of fruit skin and foam brought on more laughter, and they were both suddenly breathless but unable to cease the spasms of laughter hiccupping up from their stomachs.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Lawsuit forces famed pickle dealer Guss' Pickles to change its name BY Jeff Wilkins and Carrie Melago DAILY NEWS WRITERS Friday, July 31st 2009, 8:34 AM Owner Pat Fairhurst seen at Guss' Pickles on Orchard St. Manhattan, which will move to Brooklyn. There's never a dill moment for pickle purveyors. A landmark lower East Side pickle store will have to change its name when it moves to Brooklyn, the end result of a briny legal battle. Guss' Pickles, immortalized in the 1988 film \\"Crossing Delancey,\\" will have to leave behind its famous moniker when owner Pat Fairhurst sets up shop in Borough Park. \\"It doesn't matter what our name is. People are going to know where I'm going,\\" said Fairhurst, who has owned the store since 2004. \\"I'll put whatever I want on the sign, and they'll still come because it's our pickles they want.\\" Fairhurst revealed this week that she will move the landmark shop thanks to high rent, lower sales and a parking meter planted in front of her trademark barrels. But keeping the store's name the same? That just wouldn't be kosher under a 2007 settlement between Fairhurst and Steve and Andrew Leibowitz, a father and son duo who also laid claim to the Guss' Pickles name. Both pickle peddlers insisted they had the true connection to Isidor Guss, the Polish immigrant who sold pickles from a pushcart in the lower East Side and later opened up the shop. Fairhurst took over the institution from Harold Baker, who had purchased it from Guss' family after the patriarch's death. But the Leibowitzes, who run United Pickle in the Bronx, also had a long relationship with the store and bought the rights to the name. Son Andrew Leibowitz's company, Crossing Delancey Pickle Enterprises, opened a Guss' Pickle shop in Cedarhurst in 2001. Fairhurst sued him in 2006, then Andrew Leibowitz countersued. A 2007 settlement allowed Fairhurst to use the name only at her Orchard St. location. That decision left a bad taste in Fairhurst's mouth, and she has nothing but sour words about it to this day. \\"We have a following, they don't,\\" she says simply. The Leibowitz's hope the move will bring an end to the sticky pickle predicament at long last. \\"I wish her all the luck in the world in her new location - as long as she doesn't use our name,\\" said Steve Leibowitz. Summary:","output":"A legal battle over the name \\"Guss' Pickles\\" has forced the landmark pickle store, featured in the 1988 film \\"Crossing Delancey,\\" to rebrand as it moves from Manhattan's East Side to Brooklyn.

Answer the following question: Mars Was Not Always Bitterly Cold Scientists at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) have reported evidence that Mars was warmer and wetter long ago than it is today.  The Caltech scientists say they have directly _ the temperature of Mars four billion years ago. At least, they established the surface temperature on part of the planet at that time. The researchers say it is the first such evidence to be discovered and presented. The Caltech scientists say carbonate  minerals formed on Mars at about eighteen degrees Celsius. They reached the finding after studying a meteorite  that had its beginnings near the Martian surface. Today, the average temperature on Mars is sixty-three degrees below zero Celsius. The finding was reported on the website of the National Academy of Sciences. Caltech Assistant Professor Woody Fischer helped to prepare the report. He says eighteen degrees Celsius is not especially cold or hot. He says this makes the finding extremely interesting. Knowing the temperature can give scientists an idea of the climate on Mars long ago. It can also help them decide whether the planet had liquid water. Spacecraft orbiting Mars have shown what appear to be rivers, lakebeds and mineral deposits. These pictures suggest that, at one time, water did flow there. Mars Rover vehicles and other spacecraft have confirmed the information. Caltech Geology Professor John Eiler was another writer of the report. He says knowing the temperature of Mars from long ago provides valuable information. It shows that early in the planet's history, at least part of Mars could support a climate like that of Earth. The meteorite the scientists examined is one of the oldest known rocks in the world. It is called the Allan Hills meteorite. Its name came from the place in Antarctica where it was found in 1984. The meteorite is believed to have blown loose from the Mars' surface when another space rock struck its \\"home.\\" Where can we most probably read this passage? A) In a biography of scientists.

Question: Generate a question that has the following answer:  17  for the following movie plot:  17-year-old Pete Riley works as the assistant manager at the local 26-screen grand megaplex, a job that he loves and spends the majority of his time at. Rumor has it that the megaplex is haunted by a \\"phantom\\", someone who was trapped inside the old movie theater that was demolished to build the current megaplex. Pete, senior manager Shawn MacGibbon, the other employees, and an elderly member of the family who once owned the original theater known as \\"Movie Mason\\" (played by Mickey Rooney) who loves movies and thinks he works at the megaplex, are working to prepare the theater for the star-studded premiere of the new Hollywood blockbuster \\"Midnight Mayhem\\". Wolfgang Nedermeyer, the owner of the megaplex, is to be among the guests. To Pete's disappointment, he is forced to bring along his younger siblings, 13-year-old Karen and 12-year-old Bryan, to the theater while their widowed mother goes out on a date with her boyfriend George. Pete dumps his siblings in a movie (which Karen ditches to see a horror movie with her friends) so he can focus on setting up for the premiere, but problems begin to pop up all through the megaplex. The other movies begin to suffer mishaps, which Karen and Bryan realize are all related to the titles of the films being shown (for example, a theater showing a movie called \\"Cyclone Summer\\" has a giant fan moved in front of the screen, which blows everyone out of their seats). Pete, Karen, and Bryan work together and discover that the rumored phantom is behind these acts of sabotage. Through online spoilers, Bryan and Karen are able to learn the movie's plot, and Pete is able to stop the phantom from sabotaging the premiere. The phantom is revealed to be Shawn, who Nedermeyer immediately fires; however, Shawn explodes with anger as he did all this so Nedermeyer would finally notice him (and get his name right, since he never did). Shawn is then offered partnership by the producer of \\"Midnight Mayhem\\" to make a movie based on his exploits - \\"Phantom of the Megaplex: The Shaun McGibbin...

Climate change: Durban must finish what Kyoto began There is, of course, already a legally binding deal in place: the Kyoto Protocol. In 1997, 37 major economies formally committed to cutting emissions. The EU has already surpassed its Kyoto target. But the first Kyoto Protocol commitment period ends next year and several countries have already said they will not enter a second. If the EU alone signs up, accounting for just 12pc of global emissions, then we won’t have achieved much. What we need is for all major emitters – from industrialised countries such as the EU, US and Japan, to emerging economies such as China, India and Brazil – to commit at Durban to a comprehensive global legal framework, and to complete negotiations as soon as possible and by 2015 at the latest. Together with the rest of the EU, I have made it clear that the UK is keen to secure a second commitment period of Kyoto. But this must be accompanied by the legal framework the world needs. Ultimately, Durban is about the movement others make. If we have learnt anything from the financial crisis, it is that clear rules implemented properly can prevent the toxic build-up of risk. A recent survey of large global firms found that 83pc of business leaders think a multilateral agreement is needed to tackle climate change. Businesses want certainty; only the politics lags behind. A commitment to a new agreement will provide that certainty – and Kyoto provides the basis of the rules we need to manage a destabilising climate. Durban must not be the end of Kyoto, but a chance to build on what it began. We recognise that it will take time to negotiate this. So we also want immediate action. Current voluntary pledges to reduce emissions are not yet enough; in Durban, we should agree that we must close the gap, building momentum towards a major review of ambition. We must build the system we use to measure and verify emissions cuts. We must do more on long-term financial support for developing countries, and agree how the new Green Fund will operate. And we must continue to reduce emissions from deforestation. Above all, we must show leadership. Next year I will continue to press for a more ambitious EU emissions target: a 30pc reduction by 2020. That will help us raise our sights globally. Milton Friedman once said: “Our basic function is to keep good ideas alive until the politically impossible becomes the politically inevitable.” That is a good description of the task that awaits in Durban.

Answer the following question given this paragraph:   Actually, almost all organisms obtain their energy from photosynthetic organisms. For example, if a bird eats a caterpillar, then the bird gets the energy that the caterpillar gets from the plants it eats. So the bird indirectly gets energy that began with the glucose formed through photosynthesis. Therefore, the process of photosynthesis is central to sustaining life on Earth. In eukaryotic organisms, photosynthesis occurs in chloroplasts . Only cells with chloroplasts—plant cells and algal (protist) cells—can perform photosynthesis. Animal cells and fungal cells do not have chloroplasts and, therefore, cannot photosynthesize. That is why these organisms, as well as the non-photosynthetic protists, rely on other organisms to obtain their energy. These organisms are heterotrophs.

He was a member of the orchestra engaged for a performance of Saint-Saëns's oratorio La lyre et la harpe, to be conducted by the composer. At the last minute Saint-Saëns judged the player engaged for the important and difficult organ part to be inadequate and, as a celebrated virtuoso organist, decided to play it himself. He asked the orchestra if any of them could take over as conductor; there was a chorus of \\"Oui – Monteux!\\". With great trepidation, Monteux conducted the orchestra and soloists including the composer, sight-reading the score, and was judged a success.Monteux's musical career was interrupted in 1896, when he was called up for military service. As a graduate of the Conservatoire, one of France's grandes écoles, he was required to serve only ten months rather than the three years generally required. He later described himself as \\"the most pitifully inadequate soldier that the 132nd Infantry had ever seen\\". He had inherited from his mother not only her musical talent but her short and portly build and was physically unsuited to soldiering.Returning to Paris after discharge, Monteux resumed his career as a violist. Hans Richter invited him to lead the violas in the Bayreuth Festival orchestra, but Monteux could not afford to leave his regular work in Paris. In December 1900 Monteux played the solo viola part in Berlioz's Harold in Italy, rarely heard in Paris at the time, with the Colonne Orchestra conducted by Felix Mottl. In 1902 he secured a junior conducting post at the Dieppe casino, a seasonal appointment for the summer months which brought him into contact with leading musicians from the Paris orchestras and well-known soloists on vacation. By 1907 he was the principal conductor at Dieppe, in charge of operas and orchestral concerts. As an orchestral conductor he modelled his technique on that of Arthur Nikisch, under whose baton he had played, and who was his ideal conductor.  Guess a valid title for it!

Process:  - Air is taken through the mouth - Enters the lungs - The oxygen fills the sacs in your lungs - Carbon dioxide is removed from the lungs and exhaled - The oxygen is pass throughout your body.  Perturbation hypothesis: suppose a person has just completed a spring happens, how will it affect less carbon dioxide is removed.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","output":"The process you described is the respiration process, which is essential for life. It consists of inhaling oxygen (O2) and exhaling carbon dioxide (CO2). Let's break down the process step by step, and then discuss the perturbation hypothesis considering a person who has just completed a sprint. 1. Air inhalation: When we breathe in, air enters through our mouth or nose and goes down the trachea into the bronchi and eventually reaches the lungs. 2. Oxygen in the lungs: Inside the lungs, there are tiny air sacs called alveoli. These alveoli are covered with a network of small blood vessels (capillaries), where gas exchange occurs. Oxygen from the air we breathe diffuses into the bloodstream and binds to hemoglobin in red blood cells. 3. Carbon dioxide removal: At the same time, carbon dioxide, which is a waste product of cellular respiration, diffuses from the bloodstream into the alveoli. 4. Exhaling CO2: We then breathe out, exhaling carbon dioxide from our lungs. 5. The circulatory system transports the oxygen-rich blood throughout the body to supply cells with oxygen for proper cell functioning and energy production. Now regarding the perturbation hypothesis, let's assume a person has just completed a sprint, which is an intense physical activity. During such activity, the body's demand for oxygen increases, and more carbon dioxide is produced due to increased cellular respiration to produce energy. This sets a few potential responses: 1. Breathing rate increases: To meet the increased demand for oxygen and to remove more carbon dioxide from the body, the person would breathe faster and deeper. This allows more air to flow in and out of the lungs, and more carbon dioxide can be removed effectively. 2. Heart rate increases: The heart pumps faster to distribute the oxygen-rich blood more quickly to the active muscles and to help remove carbon dioxide, which needs to be brought back to the lungs for exhalation. The perturbation leads to a direct effect on the respiration process. The person's body compensates for the increased carbon dioxide levels by increasing the breathing and heart rates, ensuring an adequate supply of oxygen to the cells and efficient removal of excess carbon dioxide."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. How do you do this: What happens after I place the lemon juice in the syrup when making mooncakes?","output":"When making mooncakes, incorporating lemon juice into the syrup plays a significant role in producing a soft and tender texture with a succulent, rich filling. Here's a detailed breakdown of what happens after you add lemon juice to the syrup and how it contributes to the final texture and taste of your mooncakes. 1. Preparing the syrup: Before the lemon juice comes into play, let's discuss the importance of the syrup itself. The sugar syrup, a crucial component in mooncake-making, is typically prepared by boiling sugar, water, and sometimes a slice of lemon until it reaches a desired, thick consistency. The syrup is then allowed to cool and further thicken, sometimes for as long as a month, which allows deeper flavors to develop and ultimately enhances the taste and texture of your mooncakes. 2. The addition of lemon juice: Once the syrup has reached its optimal consistency and depth of flavor, you'll need to mix in your lemon juice. The citrus fruit adds a brightness to the syrup's flavors. Additionally, it has more crucial roles:    a. Neutralizing the alkaline dough - In most mooncake recipes, an alkaline substance like lye water, potassium carbonate, or sodium bicarbonate is added to the dough to improve its texture. The acidity provided by the lemon juice in the syrup counterbalances the alkaline nature of the dough, maintaining a neutral pH balance and producing a tender crust once the mooncake is baked.        b. Inverting the sugar - The acidity of lemon juice aids in inverting some of the sucrose in the syrup into glucose and fructose, which have humectant properties that help maintain the mooncake's moistness. Inverted sugars also have a lower tendency to crystallize, which helps keep the filling intact while incorporating it into the dough during shaping.        c. Enhancing the golden-brown crust - The Maillard reaction, responsible for producing the appealing golden-brown color of the mooncake crust, is encouraged by the presence of amino acids and reducing sugars. As mentioned earlier, the lemon juice helps invert some sugar molecules, creating a favorable environment for the Maillard reaction to occur and producing an attractive crust with a complex flavor profile. 3. Incorporating the syrup into the dough: After the lemon juice is mixed with the syrup, it's time to combine the syrup with your other dough ingredients, such as flour and fat. This process should be done carefully and gradually, paying attention to the consistency of your dough to ensure it remains pliable and easy to handle. It's essential to avoid overmixing the dough, as that could lead to a tough, undesirably textured mooncake. 4. Assembly and shaping: Now that your dough and filling are prepared, it's time to assemble and shape the mooncakes. The syrup infused with the lemon juice aids in keeping its shape while also holding in the filling during the baking process. Achieving a consistent thickness around the filling ensures even cooking and the ideal balance of crust and filling in each bite. 5. Baking: When you bake the mooncakes, the heat prompts the Maillard reaction and caramelization processes, resulting in a gorgeously golden-brown crust. The lemon juice in the syrup also contributes to minimizing the risk of an overly tough crust. Perfectly baked mooncakes should be tender on the outside with a rich and moist filling on the inside. 6. Storing and resting: Once your mooncakes have cooled, it's essential to allow them to \\"rest\\" for one or two days before consuming them. During this resting period, the syrup flavored with lemon juice continues to be absorbed into the dough, keeping the mooncake moist and tender. The flavors meld together, and the crust becomes soft and smooth, achieving the ideal mooncake experience. In conclusion, adding lemon juice to the syrup when making mooncakes is essential for multiple reasons – it affects the pH level, promotes a moist texture, helps create that delightful golden-brown crust, and enhances overall flavor. By carefully following each step of the mooncake-making process, you can ensure delicious, perfectly textured mooncakes every time."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

But before we get into the details of the new version, let us explain the big picture problem we are addressing.      We recently conducted a survey of 300 professionals who are involved in the hiring process at their company to understand the use of social networks for screening job applicants. The results of this survey are shown in this infographic:      So what do these results really tell us? From our perspective, there are three key takeaways:      Whether you like it or not, hirers are using social networks to screen job applicants. This means it is important to carefully manage your image on these types of sites. Facebook and Twitter are being used a lot to screen job applicants. On Facebook and Twitter, we believe hirers are trying to get a more personal view of a candidate, rather than the resume-like view they will see on LinkedIn. Hirers are looking at the social networking profiles of candidates very early in the process. This means that job seekers need to have their online act in order before they begin looking for a job.      The bottom line is that it is important for users, whether they are looking for a job or building up their professional reputation, to manage their online image across the different social networks they use. And this is the big picture problem we are addressing with the new version of Reppler.      The features in the new version of Reppler include:      Support for Twitter and LinkedIn – Reppler now supports Twitter and LinkedIn, in addition to the support for Facebook it currently has.      Cross-Network Analysis – In addition to monitoring each of these services to provide you feedback on the tone of language used, inappropriate content found, and other potential issues and risks identified, Reppler provides cross-network analysis in a couple areas. It looks at all of your connections across the social networks you use to inform you on the makeup of your connections. For example, Reppler will show you how many of your professional connections on LinkedIn are also friends of yours on Facebook. Reppler also provides a comparison matrix of your profile information on each social network so you can see if there are any inconsistencies in how you are presenting yourself.      The Reppler Image Score – Reppler calculates what we call the Reppler Image Score, a measure that takes into account a variety of elements that can affect your online image – the completeness of information in your profiles, the consistency of your information across different social networks, the tone of your content, the appropriateness of your content, the number of people you are connected to, etc.      Weekly Updates – Reppler automatically sends you a weekly email that summarizes activity across your social networks that could affect your online image. This keeps you abreast of any issues and gives you the opportunity to take action before it is too late.      That’s a quick overview of the new version of Reppler. Now you can effectively manage your online image across the different social networks you use. Reppler is a free service and you can sign up by going to www.reppler.com.

He heard some barking on the next street, so he ran to see if it was his puppy. Sure enough, he saw Max playing with a poodle. The dogs were having so much fun. Joey brought Max home, happy that he had his puppy back. Max seemed to be happy to have his human by his side as well as a new doggy friend. All summer long, Joey took Max to the poodle's house so they could play without having to worry about losing his present.  Question: \\"How did Joey meet the poodle and what kind of relationship did he have with it?\\" Answer: \\"Max was playing with the poodle\\" Is this answer to the question correct?

Pick your answer from: +yes. +it is not possible to tell. +no.","output":"+it is not possible to tell. Based on the premise \\"Harvesting and Long Term Exposure Effects in the Relation between Air Pollution and Mortality,\\" we cannot conclusively determine whether the hypothesis \\"Connection between Air Pollution and food over time\\" is true. This is because the initial premise only establishes a link between air pollution and mortality, and does not specifically explore the impact of air pollution on food over time. In order to draw a reliable conclusion about the connection between air pollution and food over time, a separate study would be needed. This independent research should incorporate various factors like: 1. Examining how air pollution affects different types of crops and their growth patterns. 2. Assessing the nutritional quality of the crops in polluted environments and comparing it to crops grown in cleaner surroundings. 3. Determining if higher levels of air pollution cause food-borne diseases and alter the taste or texture of the food. 4. Evaluating how air pollution may impact food transport, storage, and availability to consumers, especially in dense urban settings with poor air quality. It is essential to gather scientific data on these factors to establish a meaningful connection between air pollution and food over time. Research outcomes should be based on rigorous methodologies, employing both short-term and long-term exposure to air pollutants. This would allow a better understanding of the causal relationship between air pollution and food and how it might influence human health and nutritional needs. In conclusion, while the given premise suggests a connection between air pollution and mortality, it does not provide enough information to confirm the hypothesis that there's a connection between air pollution and food over time. A more targeted study would be needed to establish a conclusive link between the two."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: Blood and Lace Movie plot: The film opens as an unseen assailant enters a dark house, removes a hammer from a kitchen drawer, and walks though the house to the bedroom of a sleeping man and woman. The killer uses the claw of the hammer to beat the woman to death, and the man is bludgeoned as well, his face mutilated. Then the murderer sets the room on fire. The man in the bed tries to crawl to safety, flames burning his face.Ellie Masters (Melody Patterson) wakes up screaming in bed, the opening incident being the subject of her nightmare. The murdered woman was her mother, Edna, who was a small town prostitute. The man in bed with her was her latest john, and his body has apparently not been recovered. A social worker named Mullins (Milton Selzer) has Ellie temporarily housed in a hospital, but Ellie wants to leave and go in search of her estranged father, whom she has never met. Mullins refuses, since Ellie is still a minor and technically a ward of the state, and Mullins says if she leaves, he will have to report it to the sheriff. Ellie does pack a suitcase and makes a run for it, but a mysterious man follows her in a car. He reveals himself to be Calvin Carruthers (Vic Tayback), a former theater performer and now a detective working for the county Sheriff's department. He tells Ellie he knows who she is, and that he will look out for her, and he takes her back to the hospital. Later, Calvin meets Mullins for a drink in a bar and asks about his intentions regarding Ellie. Mullins says he's placing Ellie in the Deere Youth Home, an isolated orphanage run by a recently widowed woman named Mrs. Deere (Gloria Grahame). Mullins accuses Calvin of having a prurient interest in Ellie, and Calvin admits that he'd like to make Ellie his wife because he considers her good \\"breeding stock\\". Mullins tells Calvin that Ellie could never be interested in him because he's too old for her, but Calvin cuts him off by revealing that he knows Mullins has an unorthodox \\"business arrangement\\" with Mrs. Deere where he sends certain orphans to her home.... The answer to this question is:","output":"In the movie Blood and Lace, it is not explicitly mentioned who Ellie is attracted to. However, there are a few characters in the movie that potentially play a role in her relationships. These characters include her social worker Mullins and Calvin Carruthers, the detective working for the county Sheriff's department. Both Mullins and Calvin express an interest in Ellie, but their intentions may not be genuine or in Ellie's best interest. It is important to note that Ellie's primary focus throughout the plot seems to be finding her estranged father and escaping her difficult circumstances rather than building a romantic relationship."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

When is it time to give up pursuing a guy you like? When is it time to give up pursuing a girl you really like?","output":"The two questions essentially have the same meaning, as they both address the theme of knowing when to stop pursuing someone you are romantically interested in. However, the first question is specifically about giving up on pursuing a guy, whereas the second question pertains to giving up on pursuing a girl.  Despite the slight difference in the subjects' gender, both questions are seeking guidance on the same issue: recognizing the right time to discontinue pursuing someone you have strong feelings for. Various factors can contribute to this decision, such as a lack of reciprocation, differences in values, and practical circumstances. The core idea in both instances is to evaluate the situation and determine whether continuing to pursue the person is worth the time, effort, and emotional investment. Here is a more detailed breakdown of factors that could be relevant to both questions: 1. Lack of reciprocation: If the person you like consistently shows no interest in you or repeatedly declines your invitations, it may be time to consider giving up. It's essential to respect their feelings and boundaries. It's also important to protect your self-esteem and emotional well-being, which can be negatively impacted in the face of constant rejection. 2. Emotional unavailability: If the person you're interested in is not emotionally available (e.g., still dealing with past trauma or a recent breakup), it may be better to give them space and time to heal. Pursuing someone who isn't ready for a relationship often leads to heartbreak and disappointment for both parties. 3. Incompatibility: It's crucial to evaluate whether your values, interests, and life goals align with the other person's. Continuously trying to cultivate a relationship with someone fundamentally incompatible with you may be both unfulfilling and exhausting in the long run. 4. External factors: Sometimes, external factors such as distance, career obligations, or family commitments can affect the pursuit of a romantic interest. It may be worth reassessing the situation and prioritizing what's most important in your life at that moment. 5. Impact on personal well-being: If pursuing the person you like is causing you emotional distress, anxiety, or unhealthy behaviors, it's crucial to prioritize your mental and emotional well-being. It's essential to recognize the toll the pursuit may be taking on your life and consider whether it's time to step back and focus on self-care. In conclusion, although the two questions specifically deal with pursuing a guy and a girl, the meaning behind both is nearly identical. The primary focus is on identifying the appropriate time to let go of a romantic pursuit and contemplating various factors contributing to that decision. Prioritizing one's well-being, respecting the other person's feelings, and recognizing when to move on are crucial steps in the process."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Let's learn about air conditioners today. Air conditioners are those cool machines that help make our rooms nice and cold when it's hot outside. To make sure our room feels just right, we need to find the perfect air conditioner for it. To do that, we need to know how big our room is and how much sunlight it gets every day. First, let's talk about measuring the area of the room that needs to be cooled. The area is just a fancy word for how big our room is. It's like a big hug around the whole room, from wall to wall. We can measure the area by using a really cool tool called a measuring tape. Measure how long and how wide your room is, and then multiply those two numbers together to find the area. This will help us know how powerful our air conditioner should be. Next, we need to talk about something called BTU. BTU stands for British Thermal Units, but don't worry about the big words. Just remember that BTU tells us how strong and cool the air conditioner is. The bigger the BTU number, the stronger and cooler the air conditioner will be in our room. But how do we know which BTU number is right for our room? To find the perfect air conditioner, look at a special chart called the Recommended BTU Chart. This chart helps us match the area of our room to the right BTU number. For example, if our room is 150 square feet, then we might need an air conditioner with 5,000 BTU to cool our room and make it feel just right. But wait! There's one more thing to think about. Do you remember how we talked about sunlight? If our room gets lots of sunlight, then it can become really hot and bright inside. In this case, we might need an air conditioner with a higher BTU rating than what the chart tells us. This means that our air conditioner needs to be even stronger and cooler to keep our room nice and chilly.  To sum it up, we need to measure the area of our room, use the Recommended BTU Chart to find the right air conditioner, and consider getting a stronger air conditioner if our room gets a lot of sunlight. That way, we can make sure our room stays nice and cool, even on the hottest days.

It superseded the \\"Kaiserliche Marine\\" (German Imperial Navy) of World War I and the inter-war \\"Reichsmarine\\". The \\"Kriegsmarine\\" was one of three official branchesalong with the \\"Heer (Army)\\" and the \\"Luftwaffe (Air Force)\\"of the Wehrmacht, the armed forces of Nazi Germany.  - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history.  - Trench warfare is a type of land warfare using occupied fighting lines consisting largely of trenches, in which troops are significantly protected from the enemy's small arms fire and are substantially sheltered from artillery. The most famous use of trench warfare is the Western Front in World War I. It has become a byword for stalemate, attrition, sieges and futility in conflict.  - Friedrich Christiansen ( 12 December 1879 -- 3 December 1972 ) was a World War I German seaplane ace who claimed shooting down twenty planes and an airship ; thirteen of those victories were confirmed . During World War II , he was the commander of the German Wehrmacht in the Netherlands ; he was convicted for war crimes after the war .  - Nazi Germany is the common English name for the period in German history from 1933 to 1945, when Germany was governed by a dictatorship under the control of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party (NSDAP). Under Hitler's rule, Germany was transformed into a fascist state in which the Nazi Party took totalitarian control over nearly all aspects of life. The official name of the state was \\"Deutsches Reich\\" from 1933 to 1943 and \\"Großdeutsches Reich\\" (\\"Greater German Reich\\") from 1943 to 1945. The period is also known under the names the Third Reich and the National Socialist Period (abbreviated as \\"NS-Zeit\\"). The Nazi regime came to an end after the Allied Powers defeated Germany in May 1945, ending World War II in Europe.  - The Wehrmacht (lit. \\"defence force\\") was the unified armed forces of Nazi Germany from 1935 to 1946. It consisted of the \\"Heer\\" (army), the \\"Kriegsmarine\\" (navy) and the \\"Luftwaffe\\" (air force). The designation \\"Wehrmacht\\" for Nazi Germany's military replaced the previously used term, \\"Reichswehr\\" (191935), and was the manifestation of Nazi Germany's efforts to rearm the nation to a greater extent than the Treaty of Versailles permitted.  - An aircraft is a machine that is able to fly by gaining support from the air. It counters the force of gravity by using either static lift or by using the dynamic lift of an airfoil, or in a few cases the downward thrust from jet engines.  - In general, a civilian is \\"a person who is not a member of the military or of a police or firefighting force\\", as defined by Merriam Webster's Dictionary. From the perspective of the U.S. Department of Defense, Chapter 18 of Title 10 United States Code refers to non-military law enforcement officers as civilians since they are employees rather than enlisted personnel, and also in order to distinguish itself from military police. In military and law enforcement slang, the term \\"Civies\\" or \\"Civvies\\" are often used to refer civilian population or civilian clothing.  - Strategic bombing is a military strategy used in a total war with the goal of defeating the enemy by destroying its morale or its economic ability to produce and transport materiel to the theatres of military operations, or both. It is a systematically organized and executed attack from the air which can utilize strategic bombers, long- or medium-range missiles, or nuclear-armed fighter-bomber aircraft to attack targets deemed vital to the enemy's war-making capability.  - The Reichswehr (English: Imperial Defence) formed the military organisation of Germany from 1919 until 1935, when it was united with the new \\"Wehrmacht\\" (Defence Force).  - Hiroshima is perhaps best known as the first city in history to be targeted by a nuclear weapon when the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) dropped an atomic bomb on the city (and later on Nagasaki) at 8:15 a.m. on August 6, 1945, near the end of World War II.  - Military personnel are members of the armed forces. Usually, personnel are divided into military branches roughly defined by certain circumstances of their deployment. Those who serve in a typical large land force are soldiers, making up an army. Those who serve in seagoing forces are seamen or sailors, and their branch is a navy or coast guard . Marines serve in a marine corps. In the 20th century, the development of powered flight aircraft prompted the development of air forces, serviced by airmen. Designated leaders of military personnel are officers. These include commissioned officers, warrant officers and non-commissioned officers (NCOs). For naval forces, non-commissioned officers are referred to as petty officers (POs). military personnel are instructed to wear dog tags  - The Luftwaffe was the aerial warfare branch of the combined German Wehrmacht military forces during World War II. Germany's military air arms during the First World War, the \\"Luftstreitkräfte\\" of the Army and the \\"Marine-Fliegerabteilung\\" of the Navy, had been disbanded in May 1920 as a result of the terms of the Treaty of Versailles which stated that Germany was forbidden to have any air force.  - World War I (WWI or WW1), also known as the First World War, or the Great War, was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918. More than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history. Over nine million combatants and seven million civilians died as a result of the war (including the victims of a number of genocides), a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents' technological and industrial sophistication, and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare. It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history, and paved the way for major political changes, including revolutions in many of the nations involved.  - An airship or dirigible balloon is a type of aerostat or lighter-than-air aircraft that can navigate through the air under its own power. Aerostats gain their lift from large gas bags filled with a lifting gas that is less dense than the surrounding air. In early dirigibles, the lifting gas used was hydrogen, due to its high lifting capacity and ready availability. Helium gas has almost the same lifting capacity and is not flammable, unlike hydrogen, but is rare and relatively expensive. Significant amounts were first discovered in the United States and for a while helium was only used for airships by the United States. Most airships built since the 1960s have used helium, though some have used hot air.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Where would you carry a small folding knife? Choose the most suitable option to answer the above question. Options：  A. kitchen drawer  B. fishing boat  C. pocket  D. garbage bag  E. table","output":"C. Pocket Carrying a small folding knife in your pocket is the most suitable option among the given choices. A folding knife is designed to be compact and easily accessible, and keeping it in your pocket ensures that it is readily available when needed for various tasks, such as cutting rope, opening packages, or peeling fruit, among other uses. Let's consider the other options and why they may not be as suitable: A. Kitchen drawer: Although keeping a small folding knife in a kitchen drawer might work if you exclusively use it for kitchen purposes, this option is not as practical if you need the knife for multiple scenarios or while you're on the go. In addition, a kitchen drawer may already have other dedicated knives that serve specific purposes in the kitchen (like a chef's knife or paring knife) – making the folding knife less essential in this context. B. Fishing boat: Using a small folding knife while fishing is certainly a viable option; however, storing the knife on a fishing boat means that it is not as easily accessible in various other situations where it may prove useful. The pocket is advantageous, as you would have the knife at your disposal whether you are on a fishing boat or not. D. Garbage bag: This option is unsafe and impractical. Storing a small folding knife in a garbage bag would not only make it difficult to find when needed, but it would also pose a safety hazard if someone reaches into the bag without realizing that there's a sharp object inside. Furthermore, assuming the bag will be thrown away; the knife would end up getting discarded as well. E. Table: While placing the folding knife on a table would make it visible and easily accessible, it would not be as practical when you need to have the knife with you while moving around. In addition, storing a knife on a table could pose a safety hazard, especially in a household with children or pets that could accidentally knock it off or come into contact with it. In conclusion, option C – carrying a small folding knife in your pocket – is the most suitable choice. The pocket provides easy access to the knife in various situations, remains within reach when moving around, and ensures that the knife is safely stored when not in use."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

You may wonder if there are other examples of static discharge. The answer is yes. Lightning is a form of static discharge. It is much more dramatic than what happens between you and the door knocker, but it is the same principle. You can see how it occurs in the following diagram and animation. You have no doubt seen lightning in a rainstorm. What does lighting have to do with static electricity? As it turns out, everything! During a rainstorm, clouds develop regions of different charges. This happens due to the movement of air molecules, water drops, and ice particles. The negative charges are concentrated at the base of the clouds. The positive charges are concentrated at the top. The negative charges repel electrons on the ground below. The ground then becomes positively charged. Over time the differences increase. Eventually the electrons are discharged. This is what we see as lightning. You can watch an awesome slow-motion lightning strike below.  After reading the above, is \\"Agree\\" the correct answer to the question \\"Is lightning a form of static discharge?\\"? Possible answers:  +no.  +yes.","output":"Based on the information provided in the text, the correct answer is: +yes.

Short movie review: easy to like  Did the critic thinking positively or negatively of the movie?","output":"Based on the short movie review, \\"easy to like,\\" it appears that the critic is thinking positively about the movie. Although the response is quite brief and doesn't provide a comprehensive analysis of the film, the phrase \\"easy to like\\" suggests that the movie has some qualities that make it enjoyable and appealing to audiences. This can be interpreted as a positive remark, as it indicates that the viewer found the film engaging and appreciable.  The critic's positive vibes can be attributed to various factors, such as compelling storytelling, strong performances by the actors, impeccable visuals and cinematography, enjoyable soundtracks, or a thought-provoking theme that resonates with the audience. Some other aspects, like relatable characters, well-executed humor, or impactful emotional elements, could also be responsible for making the movie likable and leaving the viewer with a favorable impression. However, since the review is quite brief, it's essential not to jump to conclusions and assume that the critic loved the movie entirely. A more in-depth review would provide a better understanding of the aspects that the critic particularly enjoyed or appreciated. For instance, they might have found the movie easy to like due to notable performances by the cast but considered the storyline or plot predictable or generic. Alternatively, the cinematography might have been stunning, but the theme or message of the film was lackluster. In conclusion, the critic's statement, \\"easy to like,\\" signifies an overall positive outlook on the movie. This could mean that the critic found some valuable and enjoyable qualities in the film. However, the brevity of the review prevents us from deciphering the specific elements they appreciated or any criticisms they might have. To form a fuller understanding of the critic's perspective, more information would be required about their opinions on different aspects of the movie."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Two students studied the atmosphere of Earth and other planets from our solar system. Zack learned about Earth's atmosphere, while Ken learned about the atmospheric conditions on planet Venus.  Hint: Clouds on Earth are made of water vapor. Venus's clouds are a lot less pleasant. They are made of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide and large amounts of corrosive sulfuric acid! The atmosphere of Venus is so thick that the pressure on the surface of Venus is very high. In fact, it is 90 times greater than the pressure at Earth’s surface! The thick atmosphere causes a strong greenhouse effect. As a result, Venus is the hottest planet. Even though it is farther from the Sun, Venus is much hotter even than Mercury. Temperatures at the surface reach 465°C (860°F). That’s hot enough to melt lead!

Step 2: Locate relevant information The paragraph describes that Zack learned about Earth's atmosphere and Ken learned about the atmospheric conditions on planet Venus. Step 3: Analyze the information The paragraph mentions that clouds on Earth are made of water vapor. Therefore, Zack's study on Earth's atmosphere didn't necessarily involve sulfur dioxide clouds. The paragraph also describes Venus's clouds as being composed of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and large amounts of corrosive sulfuric acid.

Q:Given the below context:  The Pyramid of Neferirkare (in ancient Egyptian the Ba of Neferirkare) was built for the Fifth Dynasty pharaoh Neferirkare Kakai – referred to as Neferirkare – in the 25th century BC. It was the tallest structure located on the highest site at the necropolis of Abusir – found between Giza and Saqqara – and still towers over the necropolis today. The pyramid is also significant because its evacuation led to the discovery of the Abusir papyri. The Fifth Dynasty marked the end of the great pyramid constructions during the Old Kingdom. Pyramids of the era were smaller and becoming more standardized, though intricate relief decoration also proliferated. Neferirkare's pyramid deviated from convention as it was originally built as a step pyramid: a design that had been antiquated after the Third Dynasty (26th or 27th century BC). This was then encased in a second step pyramid with alterations intended to convert it into a true pyramid; however, the pharaoh's  death left the work to be completed by his successors. The remaining works were completed in haste, using cheaper building material. Because of the circumstances, Neferirkare's monument lacked several basic elements of a pyramid complex: a valley temple, a causeway, and a cult pyramid. Instead, these were replaced by a small settlement of mudbrick houses south of the monument from where cult priests could conduct their daily activities, rather than the usual pyramid town near the valley temple. The discovery of the Abusir papyri in the 1890s is owed to this. Normally, the papyrus archives would have been contained in the pyramid town where their destruction would have been assured. The pyramid became part of a greater family cemetery. The monuments to Neferirkare's consort, Khentkaus II; and his sons, Neferefre and Nyuserre Ini, are found in the surrounds. Though their construction began under different rulers, all four of these monuments were completed during the reign of Nyuserre.  Guess a valid title for it!

Answer a question about this article: During the 1920s and 1930s, British civil servants and politicians, looking back at the performance of the state during World War I, concluded that there was a need for greater co-ordination between the three Services that made up the armed forces of the United Kingdom—the British Army, the Royal Navy, and the Royal Air Force. The formation of a united ministry of defence was rejected by David Lloyd George's coalition government in 1921; but the Chiefs of Staff Committee was formed in 1923, for the purposes of inter-Service co-ordination. As rearmament became a concern during the 1930s, Stanley Baldwin created the position of Minister for Coordination of Defence. Lord Chatfield held the post until the fall of Neville Chamberlain's government in 1940; his success was limited by his lack of control over the existing Service departments and his limited political influence.

They made nearly 10.7 billion trips in 2013 – the highest total since 1956, according to passenger data reported by transit systems nationally and released on Monday by the American Public Transportation Association. Transit ridership has now fully recovered from a dip caused by the recession in the wake of the financial crisis. With services restored following economy-driven cutbacks, ridership numbers appear set to continue what had been a steady increase. “People are making a fundamental shift to having options” aside from a car in how they get around, said Michael Melaniphy, president and chief executive of the public transportation association. “This is a long-term trend.” Expanding bus and train networks help push the growth. Houston, which has been more notable for its sprawl than its public transportation offerings, had a large passenger gain. So did Seattle, Miami, Denver and San Diego. The New York area’s huge transit network saw the greatest gain, accounting for one in three trips nationally. Transit advocates argue that the public increasingly values the ability to get around without a car. They offer as evidence the nation’s urban shift and the movement to concentrate new development around transit hubs. “People want to work and live along transit lines,” Melaniphy said. “Businesses, universities and housing are all moving along those corridors.” Title:","output":"\\"More People Riding Buses, Trains, and Subways in America Than in 50 Years!\\""},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I had stepped on a rusty nail and it became infected. Time for a Tetanus shot! This was a typical occurrence for us during the summer. There was only one doctor within a one hundred square mile area and his name was Doctor Brandenbury. He was a very unpleasant, elderly man that my brothers and I did not care for since he was just a mean, old bastard. So I am shuffled off to his office and of course after hearing what had a occurred and examining my foot agreed I needed the Tetanus shot. I make a very innocent request as he is about to give me the shot. Since I knew the shot would stiffen my arm and essentially cause pain I would take it in my left arm so my throwing arm would not be affected. I tried to request this from the doctor but he did not wish to hear anything from me. He said \\"I don't give a fuck what arm you get it in.\\" He grabbed me roughly by the right arm and used the needle like a dart and just slammed it into my arm. I had never had a problem with shots before but that REALLY hurt. I started crying.

I've tried EVERYTHING! Reward charts,waiting for her to be ready, songs, you name it, we've given it a shot. Except, of course, for trying to use the toilet instead of the potty, like your daughter did. Olivia: Well, it might be worth trying that. Charlotte didn't like sitting on the potty and wasn't making any progress with potty training. One day, she just showed interest in using the toilet like a 'big girl'. Maybe Emily would respond to that as well? Jen: Really? Hmm, I haven't considered it yet. Did you use any training seat or ladder? Olivia: Yes! We bought a child-sized seat that could be placed on top of the regular toilet seat, along with a stepstool to help her reach it. Surprisingly, she adjusted quickly and felt much more comfortable using the toilet. I think it's worth a shot for Emily. Jen: Thanks, Olivia. That's a great tip. Would you recommend any specific brand or model for the training seat? Olivia: I used the “Babyloo Soft Cushion Toilet Seat” model. It provided enough cushioning to make her feel comfortable but was still easy to clean and store. As for the stepstool, we bought “Gimars Non-Slip Folding Step Stool” – it's lightweight and has a non-slip surface, so I felt confident letting Charlotte use it. Jen: That's really helpful. I think I'll give it a try. Maybe I could also invite her to watch me use the toilet more often, so that she understands what it's for and emulates it? Olivia: Absolutely! That's what we did with Charlotte. We also tried to make the process fun and engaging. For example, I gave her a book about going to the toilet or let her play with a toy while sitting on the toilet to make her feel at ease. Jen: What a great idea! I'll have to grab a few children's books about using the toilet from the library. Did you ever face any setbacks or accidents when Charlotte was transitioning from the potty to the toilet? Olivia: Of course! Setbacks and accidents are part of the potty-training process. Whenever that happened, we just stayed calm, and I kept reminding her that it's okay to make mistakes and that she'll get better with time. It's important not to get frustrated; consistency and patience are key. Jen: Thank you so much, Olivia. I feel a lot more optimistic now about potty training Emily. Sometimes, all you need is a different perspective and a fresh approach. I can't wait to give this a try and help Emily become a confident toilet user.

During the escape, Corporal 'Deacon' Greer (Corbin Allred) manages to disarm a German soldier but does not shoot him - even at the insistence of medic Gould (Alexander Niver). Gould and Deacon are joined by two other survivors, Kendrick (Larry Bagby) and Sergeant Gunderson (Peter Asle Holden). Gunderson explains it would be better to hide out until the Allies retake the area and the four hide out in an abandoned building. When a German patrol comes along, the soldiers hide under the floor. While there Deacon loosely translates a German message about a downed plane in the area. Leaving after the Germans, the Americans find British pilot Flight Sergeant Oberon Winley (Kirby Heyborne). Winley explains he has important intelligence photographs he has to get back to the Allies and the group decide to try and reach the Allied lines some 20 miles away. While on point, Deacon has a hallucination and breaks down. Gunderson explains that Deacon had inadvertently, when clearing a building during street fighting, killed two women and six children recently. Gould begins to criticize Deacon for not shooting the German and for being religious. Deacon offers him his Bible, which Gould refuses. Deacon says that Gould is asking too many questions for someone who is not interested in faith. Shortly afterwards, Kendrick falls through the roof of an old building that had been covered by the snow.

Although  Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM initially contemplated using established al Qaeda members to execute the planes operation, the late 1999 arrival in Kandahar of four aspiring jihadists from Germany suddenly presented a more attractive alternative. The Hamburg group shared the anti-U.S. fervor of the other candidates for the operation, but added the enormous advantages of fluency in English and familiarity with life in the West, based on years that each member of the group had spent living in Germany. Not surprisingly, Mohamed Atta, Ramzi Binalshibh, Marwan al Shehhi, and Ziad Jarrah would all become key players in the 9/11 conspiracy. Mohamed Atta was born on September 1, 1968, in Kafr el Sheikh, Egypt, to a middle-class family headed by his father, an attorney. After graduating from Cairo University with a degree in architectural engineering in 1990, Atta worked as an urban planner in Cairo for a couple of years. In the fall of 1991, he asked a German family he had met in Cairo to help him continue his education in Germany. They suggested he come to Hamburg and invited him to live with them there, at least initially. After completing a course in German, Atta traveled to Germany for the first time in July 1992. He resided briefly in Stuttgart and then, in the fall of 1992, moved to Hamburg to live with his host family. After enrolling at the University of Hamburg, he promptly transferred into the city engineering and planning course at the Technical University of Hamburg-Harburg, where he would remain registered as a student until the fall of 1999. He appears to have applied himself fairly seriously to his studies (at least in comparison to his jihadist friends) and actually received his degree shortly before traveling to Afghanistan. In school, Atta came across as very intelligent and reasonably pleasant, with an excellent command of the German language. When Atta arrived in Germany, he appeared religious, but not fanatically so. This would change, especially as his tendency to assert leadership became increasingly pronounced. According to Binalshibh, as early as 1995 Atta sought to organize a Muslim student association in Hamburg. In the fall of 1997, he joined a working group at the Quds mosque in Hamburg, a group designed to bridge the gap between Muslims and Christians. Atta proved a poor bridge, however, because of his abrasive and increasingly dogmatic personality. But among those who shared his beliefs, Atta stood out as a decisionmaker.

Write a title for this article: A city police officer shot and killed Rice on November 22. A citizen had called the 911 center to report a \\"guy with a pistol\\" outside a city recreation center, but the responding officers weren't told the caller said the gun might be \\"fake\\" and the guy might be a juvenile. Rice actually had a pellet gun. Will the officer and his partner be charged? On Thursday a judge said he thought there was probable cause, but his opinion is not binding. A grand jury will study this investigation report and decide whether to indict. Here are some of the report's major takeaways: The police department has said Officer Timothy Loehmann \\"shouted verbal commands\\" from inside his patrol car before firing at Rice, but the report says witness interviews don't back up that statement. Loehmann and his partner, Frank Garmback, didn't talk to the sheriff's office investigators. The patrol car didn't have a dashboard camera and security video cameras at the recreation center don't have audio. One woman who lives nearby said she heard two popping sounds, then shouting, then a third popping sound. Loehmann only fired two shots, however. An FBI agent happened to be in the area following up a bank robbery, heard about the incident and arrived about three minutes after the shooting. He found Rice lying on the ground. The two officers appeared upset and shell-shocked, he said, wanting to help Rice but not knowing what to do. The agent, a national registered paramedic who'd served in the military, tried to stop the bleeding and got assistance from an officer when he asked for it. Janell Rutherford, supervisor for patrols in that area, said patrol cars were not equipped with first-aid kits and officers had no first-aid training beyond basic CPR. The initial call to 911 described a male with a gun at the recreation center, who might have been a juvenile. Officers at the scene said they thought Rice was 16-20 and the FBI agent said he first thought Rice was \\"eighteen-ish,\\" based on his size. Rice was 5 feet 7 and weighed 195 pounds, according to the autopsy. The agent said he heard Rice's sister screaming that he was only 12 years old. The agent said, \\"I remember thinking to myself, I'm like, 'There's no way.' And I looked at his face, I'm like, 'Yeah.' He's got a young-looking face. ...\\" Rice traded a cell phone to a friend for the pistol. The friend told investigators he'd taken the air pistol apart and couldn't refasten the orange tip that distinguishes air pistols from real ones. The gun is listed as a \\"replica firearm,\\" a Colt 1911 target pistol that's 11.25 inches long. One officer said it looked \\"a thousand percent real.\\" \\"I asked him his name which he replied to me -- told me, and then he said that he was shot and he made a reference to his, uh, regarding like a gun or a question like, 'Where's my gun?' ... I can't remember exactly what it was. I just remembered that he made reference to a firearm.\\" Though he didn't talk to Cuyahoga County investigators, Loehmann talked briefly to the FBI agent while he sat in a patrol car nursing an ankle injured during the shooting at the rec center. Loehmann said, \\"He [Rice] had a gun and he reached for it,\\" according to the agent. Loehmann fired from a distance of 4.5 to 7 feet from Rice. The patrol car rolled onto the grass at the Cudell Recreation Center and Loehmann exited the vehicle and fired twice within two seconds. Cleveland police were investigating the shooting, but amid calls for an independent investigation, the Cuyahoga County Sheriff's Department was brought in. Many of the interviews with witnesses were conducted in March, more than three months after Rice was killed.

The nearly eight-minute long recording was released by ProPublica, an independent, investigative news site. ProPublica says an unidentified whistleblower passed on the recording to a civil rights attorney, who gave it to the website. Among the disturbing sounds heard on the recording was a child identified by ProPublica as a six-year-old girl from El Salvador begging authorities in Spanish to call her aunt to pick her up from the detention center. At one point in the audio, a man identified as a Border Patrol agent said in Spanish over the cries of scores of children: \\"Well, we have an orchestra here.

The Konbaung-Hanthawaddy war was the last of the many wars fought between the Burmese-speaking north and the Mon-speaking south that began with King Anawrahta's conquest of the south in 1057. Many more wars had been fought over the centuries. Aside from the Forty Years' War in the 14th and 15th centuries, the south usually had been on the losing side. But this war proved to be the proverbial final nail. For the Mon, the defeat marked the end of their dream of independence. For a long time, they would remember the utter devastation that accompanied the final collapse of their short-lived kingdom. Thousands fled across the border into Siam. One Mon monk wrote of the time: \\"Sons could not find their mothers, nor mothers their sons, and there was weeping throughout the land\\". Soon, entire communities of ethnic Burmans from the north began to settle in the delta. Mon rebellions still flared up in 1762, 1774, 1783, 1792, and 1824-1826. Each revolt typically was followed by fresh deportations, Mon flight to Siam, and punitive cultural proscriptions. The last king of Hanthawaddy was publicly humiliated and executed in 1774. In the aftermath of revolts, Burmese language was encouraged at the expense of Mon. Chronicles by late 18th century and early 19th Mon monks portrayed the south's recent history as a tale of unrelenting northern encroachment. By the early 19th century, assimilation and inter-marriage had reduced the Mon population to a small minority. Centuries of Mon supremacy along the coast came to an end. Answer this question: How many years total did Mon rebellions still flare up starting in 1762?","output":"To calculate the total number of years with Mon rebellions, we can add the individual years of each revolt mentioned in the text: 1. 1762 2. 1774 3. 1783 4. 1792 5. 1824-1826 Since the last rebellion spans multiple years, we need to account for the entire duration. The duration of the last rebellion is 1826 - 1824 + 1 = 3 years, including both 1824 and 1826. Now, adding all years: 1 (for 1762) + 1 (for 1774) + 1 (for 1783) + 1 (for 1792) + 3 (for 1824-1826) = 7 total years."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Food Crisis Is Depicted As 'Silent Tsunami' LONDON, April 22 -- More than 100 million people are being driven deeper into poverty by a \\"silent tsunami\\" of sharply rising food prices, which have sparked riots around the world and threaten U.N.-backed feeding programs for 20 million children, the top U.N. food official said Tuesday. \\"This is the new face of hunger -- the millions of people who were not in the urgent hunger category six months ago but now are,\\" Josette Sheeran, executive director of the World Food Program (WFP), said at a London news conference. \\"The world's misery index is rising.\\" Prime Minister Gordon Brown, hosting Sheeran and other private and government experts at his 10 Downing Street offices, said the growing food crisis has pushed prices to their highest levels since 1945 and rivals the current global financial turmoil as a threat to world stability. \\"Hunger is a moral challenge to each one of us as global citizens, but it is also a threat to the political and economic stability of poor nations around the world,\\" Brown said, adding that 25,000 people a day are dying of conditions linked to hunger. \\"With one child dying every five seconds from hunger-related causes, the time to act is now,\\" Brown said, pledging 60 million in emergency aid to help the WFP feed the poor in Africa and Asia, where in some nations the prices of many food staples have doubled in the past six months. Brown said the \\"vast\\" food crisis was threatening to reverse years of progress to create stronger middle classes around the world and lift millions of people out of poverty. Prices for basic food supplies such as rice, wheat and corn have skyrocketed in recent months, driven by a complex set of factors including sharply rising fuel prices, droughts in key food-producing countries, ballooning demand in emerging nations such as China and India, and the diversion of some crops to produce biofuels. Sheeran noted that the United States, which she said provides half of the world's food assistance, has pledged 200 million in emergency food aid and that Congress was considering an additional appropriation. Holding up the kind of plastic cup that the WFP uses to feed millions of children, Sheeran told reporters that the price of a metric ton of rice in parts of Asia had risen from 460 to 1,000 in less than two months. \\"People are simply being priced out of food markets,\\" she said. The WFP has budgeted 2.9 billion this year -- all from donor nations -- to conduct its feeding programs around the world, including large efforts in Sudan, Somalia, Ethiopia and other nations that could not otherwise feed themselves. Sheeran said soaring prices mean that the WFP needs an additional 755 million to meet its needs. That \\"food gap\\" jumped from 500 million just two months ago as prices keep rising, she said. What is a short summary of the above article?","output":"The article highlights a \\"silent tsunami\\" of rapidly increasing food prices, which is pushing over 100 million people into deeper poverty. The surging costs have led to riots worldwide, and the crisis threatens the feeding programs for 20 million children supported by the United Nations. Josette Sheeran, the executive director of the World Food Program (WFP), said that the new face of hunger consists of those who have fallen into this category within the last six months. The food crisis is being compared to the global financial turmoil in terms of posing a threat to world stability. The sharp rise in food prices is attributed to multiple factors, including rising fuel costs, droughts in key food-producing countries, increasing demand in countries like China and India, and the use of certain crops for biofuel production.

The Oscar-nominated documentary filmmaker wrote a lengthy Facebook post today clarifying his statements, saying they were not intended as a criticism of the movie American Sniper, based on Kyle's bestselling memoir. Anger: Michael Moore took to Twitter with his views on snipers the day after","output":"American Sniper was released, and later posted a lengthy explanation on Facebook. Controversial documentary filmmaker Michael Moore sparked a heated debate on social media this weekend after posting comments on Twitter that labeled snipers as 'cowards'. His statements were met with immediate backlash, with many assuming he was attacking the memory of the late Chris Kyle, a highly decorated U.S. Navy SEAL sniper and the subject of the recently released movie, American Sniper. American Sniper, directed by Clint Eastwood and starring Bradley Cooper, is based on the bestselling memoir of the same name. The film focuses on the life, accomplishments, and struggles of Chris Kyle, who served four tours in Iraq and is credited with 160 confirmed kills – the most in U.S. military history. On January 18th, the day following the release of American Sniper, Moore tweeted: “My uncle was killed by a sniper in WW2. We were taught that snipers were cowards because they would kill you without giving you the chance to defend yourself.” Many saw this statement as a direct jab at both Chris Kyle and the film, which led to widespread condemnation of Moore's views and a spirited defense of Kyle's memory and the role of snipers in military history. Facing mounting criticism, Moore attempted to clarify his statements in a lengthy Facebook post the following day. In it, he emphasized that his comments were not meant to target Chris Kyle specifically, nor were they intended as a critique of American Sniper as a film. Instead, he claimed his remarks were meant to reflect a broader opposition to war and a belief that snipers, in general, were not honorable due to their method of killing from a distance. Moore wrote in his Facebook post: \\"When you view a film about a true American hero (like Chris Kyle), you can never fully understand what they went through unless you have experienced it yourself. That sniper's bullet could just as easily be coming at a soldier or a civilian, depending on the circumstances.\\" Further, Moore attempted to distance himself from associating Kyle's actions with cowardice by stating that \\"the issue is not with the soldiers themselves, but with the politicians and leaders who send them into battle knowing full well the horrors they will face.\\" Despite his efforts to clarify his position and separate his views on snipers from the specific subject matter of American Sniper and Chris Kyle, Michael Moore's comments continue to fuel an ongoing debate about the role of snipers in the context of war and the military. Supporters of Moore argue that his comments reflect a broader anti-war sentiment and a desire to open up a conversation about the ethics and morality of using snipers in warfare. Critics, on the other hand, view his remarks as disrespectful and inflammatory, particularly given the timing of his comments so close to the release of a film honoring a decorated war hero. This situation highlights the power of social media in amplifying and distorting public discourse. Moore's initial tweets provoked intense reactions, leading to a broader debate that has partially overshadowed the movie's release and reigniting discussions on military tactics, heroism, and the ethics of war. As with many such controversies, only time will tell whether Michael Moore's comments will have a lasting impact on the public's perception of snipers and the military, or whether his remarks will eventually be overshadowed by the continued success of American Sniper and the ongoing debate around the issues it raises."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer: A:","output":"The tone of this product review is both slightly negative and positive. The reviewer recognizes and acknowledges the positive aspects of the book, such as its general overview of the .NET Windows curriculum and the brilliance of the author's mind. However, the overall tone leans more towards the negative side due to the reviewer's disappointment with the book's failure to provide comprehensive details and effectively teach developers about intricate procedures in creating custom controls. The reviewer also offers constructive criticism by suggesting that subsequent editions of the book would benefit from being reviewed and edited by more experienced teachers. This indicates a desire for improvement and the potential for a positive outcome in future editions.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the full name of the person who is noticed and taken to an old Jew who trains children to be pickpockets?, using the article: A young woman in labour makes her way to a parish workhouse and dies after giving birth to a boy, who is systematically named Oliver Twist by the workhouse authorities. As the years go by, Oliver and the rest of the child inmates suffer from the callous indifference of the officials in charge: beadle Mr. Bumble and matron Mrs. Corney. At the age of nine, the hungry children draw straws; Oliver loses and has to ask for a second helping of gruel (\\"Please sir, I want some more\\"). For his impudence, he is promptly apprenticed to the undertaker Mr. Sowerberry, from whom he receives somewhat better treatment. However, when another worker, Noah, maligns his dead mother, Oliver flies into a rage and attacks him, earning the orphan a whipping. Oliver runs away to London. The Artful Dodger, a skilled young pickpocket, notices him and takes him to Fagin, an old Jew who trains children to be pickpockets. Fagin sends Oliver to watch and learn as the Dodger and another boy try to rob Mr. Brownlow, a rich, elderly gentleman. Their attempt is detected, but it is Oliver who is chased through the streets by a mob and arrested. A witness clears him. Mr. Brownlow takes a liking to the boy, and gives him a home. Oliver experiences the kind of happy life he has never had before, under the care of Mr. Brownlow and the loving housekeeper, Mrs. Bedwin. Meanwhile, Fagin is visited by the mysterious Monks, who has a strong interest in Oliver. He sends Monks to Bumble and Mrs. Corney (now Bumble's domineering wife); Monks buys from them the only thing that can identify Oliver's parentage, a locket containing his mother's portrait., what would be the answer ?","output":"The full name of the person who is noticed and taken to an old Jew who trains children to be pickpockets is Oliver Twist.

Write a text based on this summary: bush calls mccain about anti-kerry political ads Text:","output":"In a remarkable turn of events, former President George W. Bush called Senator John McCain to discuss the recent onslaught of anti-John Kerry political advertisements. These ads have been making headlines and causing a stir among the public, as they target Kerry's character and record. The conversation between Bush and McCain showcases the increasing concern among prominent political figures about the nature and potential impact of negative campaign ads. While Bush did not give specific details regarding his conversation with McCain, it is believed that they discussed potential ways to address the issue and mitigate its harmful effects on political discourse. These anti-Kerry ads, criticized for their inflammatory and misleading content, have been widely circulated on social media platforms, causing a great deal of concern among both politicians and citizens alike. The fact that former President Bush, a Republican, has taken the initiative to reach out to Senator McCain, also a Republican, to address this issue is a testament to the widespread unease that negative campaign ads create. McCain has been an outspoken critic of negative political ads, specifically in his 2000 presidential campaign, when he experienced the damaging effects of such ads firsthand. He has since advocated for greater transparency and honesty in political campaigns, pushing for stricter regulations around political advertising. While it remains to be seen what concrete steps will be taken as a result of this conversation between Bush and McCain, their discussion highlights the growing consensus among politicians that negative campaign ads pose a threat to the integrity of the political process. By calling attention to this critical issue, Bush and McCain hope to spark a broader dialogue about the role of truth and civility in modern politics, ultimately leading to a more honest and constructive political environment. Despite the alarming nature of these anti-Kerry political ads, the conversation between two prominent Republicans signals a positive shift in the landscape of modern politics. As more political figures join the call for honest and transparent campaigning, perhaps the days of inflammatory and misleading political ads will soon be a thing of the past."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: One of the best ways to keep your liver healthy is to eat a balanced diet that is low in trans fats and fructose (as in \\"high fructose corn syrup\\").  These substances are found in many processed foods, including chips, soda, fried foods, etc., and have both been shown to contribute negatively to liver function.  Processed foods also include a host of other chemicals to maintain freshness and appearance, which your liver has to work to filter out. Your best bet for maintaining liver (and overall!) health is to minimize your consumption of prepackaged and processed foods, and prepare food from scratch using fresh ingredients whenever possible. Organic food is produced using minimal pesticides in the case of produce, and minimal or no added hormones or antibiotics, in the case of animal products.  This translates to less chemicals and additives that your liver has to filter out. It is important to note that organic foods still may contain some residual pesticides, and the jury is still out on how much of a health benefit they provide.  However, if you can afford to go organic, it certainly won't harm your liver, and you will be helping the environment, as well. A recent study published in Hepatology found that coffee drinkers, including those who drank decaf, were up to 25 percent less likely to have abnormal liver enzyme levels.  Researchers do not yet know why this is the case, but drinking coffee may be helping your liver out. Regular exercise not only helps you maintain a healthy body weight, it does good things for your liver, as well.  Studies have shown that just 150 minutes of activity per week (that’s just 1/2 an hour, five days per week) is enough to improve liver enzyme levels, and overall liver function. It can also reduce your chances of developing fatty liver disease. As if you didn't have enough reasons to quit already: numerous studies have shown that smoking drastically increases the risks of contracting both cirrhosis (scarring) of the liver, and liver cancer. Hepatitis is an inflammation of the liver that is usually caused by a virus.  There are three main types of hepatitis: A, B, and C, and all are contagious, however hepatitis C is usually only spread by sharing intravenous needles.  Vaccines are available for hepatitis A and B.  Practice good hygiene: remember to wash your hands after using the restroom or changing a baby's diaper. Hepatitis B is commonly spread through unprotected sex, so always wear a condom. Do not share drug needles with another person, or come in contact with another person's blood. Get vaccinated for hepatitis A and B.

Q:Read the article and select the best answer. Article: In many businesses, computers have largely replaced paperwork, because they are fast, and do not make mistakes. And they are honest. Many banks say that their business is \\"untouched by human hands\\" and therefore safe. But they have no thought that the growing number of computer crimes   show they can be used to steal. Computer criminals   don't use guns. And even if they are caught, it is hard to punish them because there is often no proof. A computer cannot remember who used it. It simply does what it is told. The head teller  at a New York City bank used a computer to steal more than one and a half billion dollars in just four years. No one noticed this because he moved the money from one account   to another. Each time a customer whose money he had stolen questioned the balance in his account, the teller said it was a computer mistake, then replaced the missing money from someone else's account. This man was caught at last. Some workers use the computer's power to punish their bosses they consider unfair. Recently, a large company fired its computer record assistant for reasons that were connected with her personal life rather than her job. She was given thirty days notice. In those thirty days, she stole all the company's computerized records. Most computer criminals have been common workers. Now police wonder if this is \\"the tip of iceberg\\". As one official says, \\"I have the feeling that there is more crime out there than we are catching. What we are seeing now is all so poorly done.

However, if we were to assess the given options based on the provided information, option 1 seems to be the most plausible cause in case they did get sunburned. Here is a detailed analysis of the options: 1. They sweat so much that the sunscreen came off. Considering the intensity of the biking and excitement level of the individual, it is likely that they may have sweated profusely, causing the sunscreen to come off or become less effective in protecting their skin from the sun's rays. The passage mentions that they were \\"fried just six miles in\\" and \\"could n't hold back,\\" indicating rigorous exertion and potentially excessive sweating. 2. They didn't use a high enough SPF. This option is less likely because the individual applied SPF 50 sunscreen before going out. SPF 50 is generally considered to be a high SPF, offering adequate sun protection for most people. While this option cannot be entirely ruled out, as different skin types require different levels of sun protection, it is not as plausible given the information provided in the passage. 3. They didn't apply enough. The passage does not provide any information regarding the amount of sunscreen applied or whether it was insufficient, so we cannot infer this as the reason why they might have gotten sunburned. Hence, this cannot be considered as the most likely reason. 4. None of the above choices. Since there is no direct evidence in the passage that supports or contradicts the other options, this choice does not provide useful insight.

If we are feeling great, we may give our body signals . If we look at someone else's body, we can often tell how they are feeling by their body signals. So reading body language signals is a great tool in daily communication. In case  you don't think that learning how to read and use body language is important, here are some numbers for you. 7% of the information we receive is from what people actually say, and 38% of the information we receive is from the tone  and the speed of their voice; while 55% of the information we receive is from their body language. These non-verbal  signals will help you a lot, but you still need to focus on what people are saying. If you focus too much on their body language signals, you and the person may feel uncomfortable. It is useful to be able to read people's body language, but it is useful to learn how to send the right signals and avoid the wrong signals too. Body language may be given several interpretations. Many signals have different meanings, depending on the person and the situation. Be sure of it when you are trying to read a body language signal.

Help as much as you can. Dietary supplements are big business, with around half of the Australian population using at least one type per year; most commonly a multivitamin and mineral pill. Many people take supplements as a form of dietary insurance in case they are not meeting their nutrient needs from foods alone. Others take them as a form of health insurance – to protect against certain diseases. Some just take them out of habit. Supplements do have a role to play in some situations. People with a diagnosed deficiency, those with malabsorption conditions, women planning pregnancy, and people with very poor diets all can benefit from specific nutrient supplementation. But what about the benefit of supplements across the broad population? The mantra of most health professionals, which is even etched on the label of many supplements, is that supplements may only be of assistance if dietary sources are lacking. To see if this is supported by solid evidence, a systematic review of 63 clinical trials involving some form of supplementation in non-pregnant adults was carried out by a team of medical researchers. The clinical trials were broad in their nature with many nutrients studied including vitamins A, B6, B12, C, D and E; folic acid; calcium; selenium, omega-3 fatty acids; ginkgo biloba; glucosamine; saw palmetto; and milk thistle. All of the studies were randomised controlled trials and evaluated a range of health outcomes including risk of heart disease, cancer, diabetes, bone fractures, cognitive function and all-cause mortality. From the 63 studies, no benefit was seen in 45 studies with 10 of these showing a trend towards harm and just two showing a trend towards a benefit. Of the remaining studies, four showed harm with a greater risk of cancer with beta-carotene and a higher risk of fractures with a once-yearly dose of vitamin D. One study showed a lower risk of cancer with selenium supplementation, but this was not validated in much larger trials. Twelve studies showed a benefit and these mostly involved vitamin D... Question: When are supplements mainly of assistance to people? === The answer to the above question is  a. When there is a risk of cancer; b. not enough information; c. after the diagnosis of heart disease; d. when dietary sources are inadequate; Answer:","output":"d. when dietary sources are inadequate;"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

First, I lived in a cottage that was in an old motel. It had a cottage in front where the landlady lived and there were ten little cottages in a half-moon configuration around it. Ours was a party place and we didn't have a phone. This was in the early 1970's. The landlady was in her 50's I'd guess. The only phone was a pay-phone outside her cottage and it was o party line with her phone. When we used it, she would try to listen, especially if we were talking to a girl. We could tell and sometimes we'd ask he to hang up, but other times we'd talk about sexy stuff and let her listen. We could hear her breathing heavy when we did. When we'd be parting, she'd come to the door wearing sexy clothes that were completely inappropriate and want to be invited in. Though we were a bunch of horny sailors, no one wanted any part of that. We never let her come in. I got married and moved into an apartment that was three rooms in a huge old house. They closed that Navy base and all of the sailors were transferred elsewhere. There were bumper-stickers that said, \\"Will the last sailor to leave, please turn out the lights.\\" In those days, Newport was a small town that leached off of sailors.

Macreedy is looking for a man named Komoko, but the few residents are inexplicably hostile. The young hotel desk clerk, Pete Wirth (John Ericson), claims he has no vacant rooms. Macreedy is threatened by Hector David (Lee Marvin). Later, Reno Smith (Robert Ryan) informs Macreedy that Komoko, a Japanese-American, was interned during World War II. Certain that something is wrong, Macreedy sees the local sheriff, Tim Horn (Dean Jagger), but the alcoholic lawman is clearly afraid of Smith and is impotent to help. The veterinarian and undertaker, Doc Velie (Walter Brennan), advises Macreedy to leave town immediately, but also lets slip that Komoko is dead. Pete's sister, Liz (Anne Francis), rents Macreedy a Jeep. He drives to nearby Adobe Flat, where he finds a homestead burned to the ground and wildflowers. On the way back, Coley Trimble (Ernest Borgnine) tries to run him off the road. When Smith asks, Macreedy reveals he lost his left arm fighting in Italy. Macreedy says the wildflowers at the Komoko place lead him to suspect that a body is buried there. Smith reveals that he is virulently anti-Japanese; he tried to enlist in the Marines the day after the attack on Pearl Harbor, but failed the physical.

Premise: A girl playing in a puddle while wearing a pink coat Hypothesis: The girls pink coat is a raincoat. .Can we conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true?","output":"Based on the premise alone, which states that a girl is playing in a puddle while wearing a pink coat, we cannot definitively conclude that the hypothesis is true. To determine the validity of the hypothesis, which suggests that the girl's pink coat is a raincoat, additional information or evidence is needed.  It is plausible to assume, given the context of the girl playing in a puddle, that she might be wearing a raincoat since raincoats are designed to keep people dry during wet conditions. However, this assumption neglects other possibilities, such as the coat being made of a different material or being worn for reasons unrelated to its water-resistant properties. Additionally, the color of the coat, pink in this case, does not provide any information about the type or function of the coat. To draw a valid conclusion, we can consider the following factors and pieces of information: 1. Material and Characteristics of the Coat: Establish whether the coat's material is water-resistant or designed specifically for rain, such as GORE-TEX or coated nylon. If such information is available, it could help determine if the coat is indeed a raincoat. 2. Context and Situation: Analyze the situation in which the girl is playing in the puddle. Is it raining or has it recently rained? If it is clear that wet conditions have prompted the girl to wear her pink coat, it would support the hypothesis that it is a raincoat. 3. Style and Design: Examine the coat's design features, such as a hood, sealed seams, or storm flaps, that suggest it is built for rainy weather protection. These features might indicate that the coat is specifically designed to provide protection from rain. 4. Testimony or Statements: If there are statements from the girl or her caregivers concerning the purpose of the coat that directly suggest it is intended for rainy or wet conditions, it would serve as direct evidence to support the hypothesis. 5. Observations and Comparisons: Observe other people in the vicinity or compare the girl’s coat to other raincoats to identify similarities or differences in design and purpose. If the pink coat displays characteristics common among raincoats, it may strengthen the argument that it is, in fact, a raincoat. In conclusion, although the hypothesis that the girl's pink coat is a raincoat appears plausible in the context of the premise, we cannot definitively conclude its validity without additional information or evidence. Further investigation into the coat's material, characteristics, context, design, and any accompanying statements or testimonies would be necessary to support or refute the hypothesis."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Rio stayed the capital of the pluricontinental Lusitanian monarchy until 1822, when the War of Brazilian Independence began. This is one of the few instances in history that the capital of a colonising country officially shifted to a city in one of its colonies.

What motivates people like David Irving to become Holocaust deniers? Do those questions have the same meaning? Available options:  *no.  *yes.","output":"To complete the task, I will first research the number of Holocaust deniers and their reasons, followed by investigating the motivations of people like David Irving, and lastly, I will compare the questions to determine whether they have the same meaning or not. Step 1: Research the number of Holocaust deniers and their reasons. It is difficult to pinpoint an exact number of people who deny the Holocaust as the figures and percentages can vary among different countries and populations. However, according to a study conducted by the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) in 2014, surveyed respondents around the world showed that 35% of those who had heard about the Holocaust thought it was either a myth, an exaggeration, or that they were unsure of its existence. As for the reasons behind their denial, some common motivations include anti-Semitism, a desire to rehabilitate the image of Axis Powers (primarily Germany and its allies), or conspiracy theories. Step 2: Investigate the motivations of people like David Irving. David Irving is a notable figure in the Holocaust denial movement. His motivations for becoming a Holocaust denier can be attributed to political beliefs and personal ideologies. Irving has been criticized for distorting historical records and manipulating facts in order to promote his revisionist agenda.

Step 3: Compare the questions to determine whether they have the same meaning. The first question asks about the number of Holocaust deniers and their motivations, whereas the second question specifically inquires about the motivations of people like David Irving, who are notable Holocaust deniers.

Question: Who administered the \\"Pencil Test\\"? Answer: Minor officials administered tests to enforce the classifications.  Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion?","output":"The \\"Pencil Test\\" was predominantly administered by minor officials who were responsible for enforcing racial classifications during the apartheid era in South Africa. However, to fully comprehend and appreciate the context and implications of this practice, it's essential to dive deeper into the history and development of the apartheid system in the country. Apartheid, which is an Afrikaans word meaning \\"separateness,\\" was a policy of systematic racial segregation and discrimination implemented by the National Party government in South Africa from 1948 to 1994. Under this policy, the country's population was divided into four main racial categories: White, Black, Coloured (mixed-race), and Indian/Asian. The classification of individuals into these categories had far-reaching consequences on their social, economic, and political lives. The \\"Pencil Test\\" (or \\"Crayon Test\\") was one of the ways used to separate and classify individuals who were not easily distinguishable as either black or white. This test was mainly practiced during the initial stages of apartheid to determine the racial categorization of individuals, particularly those who belonged to the coloured and black communities. The test involved sliding a pencil or crayon through the person's hair. The underlying assumption was that those with \\"kinkier\\" or more tightly coiled hair were considered black, while those with looser, less coiled hair were categorized as coloured. If the pencil did not fall out after being inserted into the hair, the individual would likely be deemed black; conversely, if the pencil fell out or could not be inserted at all, the person would likely be classified as coloured. The officials conducting the test were often low-ranking bureaucrats or civil servants, such as police officers or personnel from the now-defunct Department of Home Affairs. These minor officials were charged with implementing and enforcing the apartheid government's stringent and unfair racial divisions. The \\"Pencil Test\\" and other similar methods used to determine race were highly controversial and have since been widely condemned. They were dehumanizing, subjective, and rooted in racist assumptions about the difference between \\"white\\" and \\"non-white\\" features. Furthermore, the test caused anguish to many people who were separated from their families or communities based on this arbitrary measure. In 1994, with the end of apartheid and the establishment of a democratic government in South Africa, the process of dismantling racial classifications and policies began, and the importance of racial categorization as a means of governance and control started to diminish. Today, the \\"Pencil Test\\" serves as a stark reminder of the historical injustice perpetrated by the apartheid regime and highlights the importance of actively working to eradicate racial discrimination and prejudice in society."},{"instruction":"The office smelled like money.

However, given the content of the existing conversation, we can make some educated assumptions about what might have been discussed.  It's likely that the man and woman were discussing their daily routine or activities, which has lead them to the topic of internet usage. It's possible that they were talking about their jobs, productivity, and different tools and methods they use for their work.  The man might have been explaining how busy his work schedule is, possibly due to increased workloads, multiple projects or tasks that he is managing, or tight deadlines. This intensity of work could lead to a discussion on how he utilizes technology-enabled tools, like the internet, to better manage his time and increase his efficiency.  Similarly, the woman might have shared her own experiences or asked the man about how often he uses technological tools at work or for personal leisure. They might have been discussing differences in their use of technology or the internet and this prompted her to ask him about his internet surfing habits. This then prompted the man to explain how he manages to incorporate internet usage into his busy schedule. In conclusion, although the specific content before this interaction isn't provided, it's probable that the conversation before this involved the man and woman discussing their work, their workload, and their use of technology or the internet to perform their tasks efficiently.

Riggs is a former U.S. Army Special Forces soldier who lost his wife in a car accident two years prior and has turned suicidal, and has been taking his anger out on suspects, leading to his superiors requesting his transfer. Murtaugh and Riggs quickly find themselves at odds with each other. Murtaugh is contacted by Michael Hunsaker (Tom Atkins), an old Vietnam War buddy turned banker, but before they can meet, Murtaugh learns that Hunsaker's daughter, Amanda, apparently committed suicide by jumping to her death from her apartment balcony. Autopsy reports show Amanda to have been poisoned with drain cleaner, making the case a possible homicide. Hunsaker tells Murtaugh that he was worried about his daughter's involvement in drugs, prostitution, and hardcore pornography and was trying to get Murtaugh to help her escape that lifestyle. Murtaugh and Riggs go to see Amanda's pimp, but find a drug lab on the premises, leading to a shootout. Riggs kills the pimp and saves Murtaugh's life, who starts to gain respect for his new partner. Though the case seems closed, Riggs is worried that the only witness to Amanda's apparent suicide was Dixie, another prostitute who was working well outside her normal streets. They go to see her at her home but it explodes as they approach it. Riggs finds parts of a mercury switch from bomb debris, indicating a professional had set the bomb; children that had been nearby witnessed a man approach the house with a Special Forces tattoo similar to Riggs', and Murtaugh suspects Hunsaker knows more than he has let on.

Andre Roussimoff was born in Moliens, the son of Boris and Mariann Roussimoff. His parents were of Bulgarian and Polish descent. His nickname growing up was \\"Dede\\". As a child, he displayed symptoms of his gigantism very early, reaching a height of 191 cm (6 ft 3 in) and a weight of 94 kg (208 lb) by the age of 12. Andre returned in the winter of 1990, but it was not to the World Wrestling Federation. Instead, Andre made an interview appearance for Herb Abrams' fledgling Universal Wrestling Federation on October 11th in Reseda, California. (the segment aired in 1991). He appeared in an interview segment with Captain Lou Albano and put over the UWF. The following month, on November 30th at a house show in Miami, Florida the World Wrestling Federation announced Andre's return as a participant in the 1991 Royal Rumble (to be held in Miami, FL two months later). Andre was also mentioned as a participant on television but would ultimately back out due to a leg injury.  His on-air return finally came at WrestleMania VII, when he came to the aid of The Big Boss Man in his match against Mr. Perfect. Andre finally returned to action on April 26, 1991, in a six-man tag-team matchup when he teamed with the Rockers in a winning effort against Mr. Fuji and the Orient Express at a house show in Belfast, Northern Ireland. On May 10th he participated in a 17-man battle-royal at a house show in Detroit. (won by Kerry Von Erich). His last major WWF storyline following WrestleMania VII had the major heel managers (Bobby Heenan, Sensational Sherri, Slick, and Mr. Fuji) trying to recruit Andre one-by-one, only to be turned down in various humiliating ways (e.g. Heenan had his hand crushed, Sherri received a spanking, Slick got locked in the trunk of the car he was offering to Andre and Mr. Fuji got a pie in his face). Finally, Jimmy Hart appeared live on WWF Superstars to announce that he had successfully signed Andre to tag-team with Earthquake. However, when asked to confirm this by Gene Okerlund, Andre denied the claims. This led to Earthquake's attacking Andre from behind (injuring his knee). Jimmy Hart would later get revenge for the humiliation by secretly signing Tugboat and forming the Natural Disasters. This led to Andre's final major WWF appearance at SummerSlam '91, where he seconded the Bushwhackers in their match against the Disasters. Andre was on crutches at ringside, and after the Disasters won the match, they set out to attack Andre, but the Legion of Doom made their way to ringside and got in between them and the Giant, who was preparing to defend himself with one of his crutches. The Disasters left the ringside area as they were outnumbered by the Legion of Doom, the Bushwhackers and Andre, who struck both Earthquake and Typhoon (the former Tugboat) with the crutch as they left. His final WWF appearance came at a house show in Paris, France, on October 9. He was in Davey Boy Smith's corner as the Bulldog faced Earthquake. Davey Boy hit Earthquake with Andre's crutch, allowing Smith to win.

It's a good idea to shop at the same websites, because you're more likely to already know what size works best for you.

Write an article using the following points: Steve Israel says his grandparents fled persecution in Russia to seek promise of U.S. He says post-election hopes that the parties could unite over immigration reform have dimmed. He says Rep. King has insulted Latinos; Boehner-led GOP using procedural tactics to deny vote. Israel: Boehner's use of Hastert Rule is barrier to bipartisanship, thwarts will of the people.","output":"Title: The Fading Hopes for Bipartisan Immigration Reform: The Role of John Boehner and the Hastert Rule Introduction In the United States, the story of immigration is deeply woven into the nation's fabric. For many Americans, like Steve Israel, their ancestors' history is filled with tales of escaping persecution and seeking the promises and opportunities offered by the United States. Today, immigration reform remains a pressing issue where bipartisan cooperation is desperately needed. However, post-election optimism for unity on this matter has begun to slip away. This article explores the reasons behind this decline, focusing on the role played by the Republican Party, particularly Rep. John Boehner. Dimmed Hopes for Immigration Reform Following the elections, there was hope that both major political parties would set aside their differences and focus on much-needed immigration reform. Sadly, these hopes have been tarnished by events unfolding in the political sphere. One key figure in this disintegration is Rep. Peter King, who has made a name for himself by openly insulting Latinos. His comments and attitudes have alienated many potential supporters of bipartisan immigration reform.  Additionally, the GOP, led by John Boehner, has been accused of using procedural tactics to deny a vote on crucial legislation. This approach has only served to further poison the already strained relationship between the parties on this matter. Boehner's Use of the Hastert Rule Central to this issue is Boehner's employment of the Hastert Rule. This unwritten governing principle essentially states that the Speaker of the House will not bring a bill to the floor for a vote unless it is supported by a majority of the Speaker's party members. In essence, this rule allows a small group of politicians to have near-veto power over legislation that could benefit the majority of Americans. The Hastert Rule as a Barrier to Bipartisanship The use of the Hastert Rule by Boehner has created a significant roadblock to bipartisan cooperation on immigration reform. By adhering to this rule, he is effectively stifering the will of the people and ignoring the calls for change from both his constituents and citizens across the country. As the United States continues to grapple with the complex issue of immigration, it is essential that our elected leaders be willing and able to come together and develop policy that will benefit all Americans. Unfortunately, the current situation, notably Boehner's reliance on the Hastert Rule, is acting as a barrier to the kind of bipartisanship required in this critical moment in our nation's history. Conclusion The fading hopes for bipartisan immigration reform are a troubling indicator of the state of our political climate. While Steve Israel's grandparents found promise in the United States, many others still long for the opportunities they were once afforded. This journey to a better life has hit an all-too-familiar political roadblock, and it remains to be seen if our leaders will be able to navigate around it. For now, the question remains: Can the United States rediscover the unity needed to address this vital issue, or will it continue to be blocked by those who refuse to compromise? Only time will tell if our elected officials can rise to the occasion, embrace bipartisanship, and make the changes necessary to ensure that the American Dream remains alive and well for generations to come."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Unemployed mum-of-five demands bigger home from the council… so her children don’t have to SHARE a bedroom Unemployed Rachael Dower, 28, claims her family has outgrown their current property A BENEFITS mum-of-five is demanding a bigger home – so her children don’t have to SHARE a bedroom. Unemployed Rachael Dower, 28, says her housing provider must upgrade her – as she keeps having kids and has outgrown her current property. She has continued to grow her family despite having not worked in over ten years and always claiming benefits. And now she wants a larger house so her children all have their own space. The handout-reliant mum lives with her partner Keith Birchmore, 29, and kids in a two bedroom home in Camborne, Cornwall, and says she has spent six months trying to move. She says she feels justified in making the demands as it is “unfair” that her daughter, Antonia, 11, has to share what she describes as a tiny “box room” with four brothers -Blake, two, Keedan, nine, Rhys, eight, and Oakley, six. She said: “I know people say it’s my fault for having so many kids but it’s what I wanted. We are just asking for an extra bedroom. “We just want to move into a nice family home. It’s not family-like here. At the moment they are all in one box room and it’s not a good way for the children to live. “I don’t mind the boys sharing but my daughter is approaching the age when she will be experiencing lady problems so it’s so important for her to get her own space. “It’s not fair on my daughter and it’s driving me nuts. She has not got her own privacy. It’s not fair at all.” Miss Dower has been asking Coastline Housing for a bigger home for half a year. She says that she gets around £240 a week in total benefits and they currently have all of their rent paid for through housing benefit. Miss Dower had previously been in £,1500 rent arrears but claims that she was promised by the provider that they would find her a more suitable property once her payments were up-to-date. I know people say it’s my fault for having so many kids but it’s what I wanted. We are just asking for an extra bedroom But having cleared her debts at a rate of £85 a week she says she is still waiting for news of a bigger property becoming available. She also registered with Cornwall Council’s Homechoice scheme in an effort to get a new home, but despite being accepted onto it after eight weeks of waiting, has yet to hear of a suitable property. She added: “We moved here nine years ago and although we got into arrears two years ago, we paid it off and I presumed that this would allow for us to move into a new house. “I’ve been told that Coastline doesn’t have a suitable property available. “Even a three bed property would be an improvement as it’s not fair on my daughter having to share with her four brothers.” “I don’t want to be here for another year, we wanted to be out by Christmas but that didn’t happen.” Miss Dower added that she will look for work in the future. “I did work – I worked in a riding school before my daughter was born 11 years ago. I do want to work,” she said. The housing provider said that there were currently no homes available. In a statement, Coastline Housing said: “We understand as this family has grown their home is now too small for their needs. “Our lettings team is working with the family and Cornwall HomeChoice. We hope to be able to offer them a move to a suitable larger home in the not too distant future, when one becomes available.” Keith works as a mechanic but doesn’t earn enough to mean they have to pay rent themselves.

Marojejy National Park is located in the northeast of Madagascar between the towns of Andapa and Sambava and extends approximately 32 km (20 mi) from east to west and 22 km (14 mi) from north to south.  It is centered on the chain of mountains known as Marojejy Massif.  Despite a scientific survey of some of the other mountains in the region by the 1929 Mission Zoologique Franco-Anglo-Américaine, Marojejy was not surveyed until 1937 when L.-J. Arragon of the Service Géographique de Madagascar ascended Marojejy Est. Arragon did not conduct any field research during his visit.  The massif was not geologically described until after the French botanist Jean-Henri Humbert from the National Museum of Natural History in Paris explored the mountains in 1948.  Humbert had previously explored numerous mountain ranges in continental Africa before going to Marojejy. Between November 1948 and November 1950, he spent five months collecting 4,039 dried plant (herbarium) specimens for study.  After several expeditions, he published the book \\"A Marvel of Nature\\" in 1955, in which he claimed the massif was the most impressive range in all of Madagascar because of its size, floral diversity, and pristine natural state.Marojejy was set aside as one of Madagascar's strict nature reserves in 1952 largely due to Humbert's enthusiasm and support.  Under this protection, only research scientists were permitted to visit the site.  In 1998, Marojejy was converted into a national park and thus became open to visitors.Originally seen as a transition zone between the eastern rainforests and the central highlands, Marojejy is now recognized as having its own unique features, with some of the richest biodiversity on the island.  Several studies from the early 1970s through the 1990s surveyed the mountain ecosystems and inventoried the flora and fauna.  In 2007, Marojejy was listed as a World Heritage Site as part of the Rainforests of the Atsinanana. Due to illegal logging and trafficking of valuable hardwoods, and especially after the 2009 political crisis in Madagascar, the Rainforests of the Atsinanana was added to the list of World Heritage in Danger in 2010.

He was a friend of Isaac Newton, Edmond Halley, and James Stirling. Even though he faced religious persecution he remained a \\"steadfast Christian\\" throughout his life. Among his fellow Huguenot exiles in England, he was a colleague of the editor and translator Pierre des Maizeaux.  - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight.  - Huguenots (or ) is a designation for an ethnoreligious group of French Protestants that follow the Reformed tradition.  - A definition is a statement of the meaning of a term (a word, phrase, or other set of symbols). Definitions can be classified into two large categories, intensional definitions (which try to give the essence of a term) and extensional definitions (which proceed by listing the objects that a term describes). Another important category of definitions is the class of ostensive definitions, which convey the meaning of a term by pointing out examples. A term may have many different senses and multiple meanings, and thus require multiple definitions.  - Probability theory is the branch of mathematics concerned with probability, the analysis of random phenomena. The central objects of probability theory are random variables, stochastic processes, and events: mathematical abstractions of non-deterministic events or measured quantities that may either be single occurrences or evolve over time in an apparently random fashion.  - In mathematics , Stirling 's approximation ( or Stirling 's formula ) is an approximation for factorials . It is a very powerful approximation , leading to accurate results even for small values of n. It is named after James Stirling , though it was first stated by Abraham de Moivre . The formula as typically used in applications is  ln ( n ! ) = n  ln ( n ) - n + O (  ln ( n ) ) ( in big O notation ) . The next term in the O ( ln ( n ) ) is 1/2ln ( 2n ) ; a more precise variant of the formula is therefore n !  sim  sqrt ( 2  pi n )  left (  frac ( n ) ( e )  right ) ^ n. It is also possible to give a version of Stirling 's formula with bounds valid for all positive integers n , rather than asymptotics : one has  sqrt ( 2  pi )  n ^ ( n +  frac12 ) e ^ ( - n )  le n !  le e  n ^ ( n +  frac12 ) e ^ ( - n ) for all positive integers n. Thus the ratio  frac ( n ! ) ( n ^ ( n +  frac12 ) e ^ ( - n ) ) is always between  2 = 2.5066 ... and e = 2.71828 ... . As an asymptotic formula , Stirling 's approximation has the property that the ratio  frac ( n ! ) (  sqrt ( 2  pi n )  left (  frac ( n ) ( e )  right ) ^ n ) approaches 1 as n grows to infinity .  - Trigonometry (from Greek \\"trignon\\", \\"triangle\\" and \\"metron\\", \\"measure\\") is a branch of mathematics that studies relationships involving lengths and angles of triangles. The field emerged in the Hellenistic world during the 3rd century BC from applications of geometry to astronomical studies.  - Pierre des Maizeaux, also spelled Desmaizeaux (c. 1666 or 1673June 1745), was a French Huguenot writer exiled in London, best known as the translator and biographer of Pierre Bayle.  - In mathematics, de Moivre's formula (also known as de Moivre's theorem and de Moivre's identity), named after Abraham de Moivre, states that for any complex number (and, in particular, for any real number) and integer it holds that  - A mathematician is someone who uses an extensive knowledge of mathematics in his/her work, typically to solve mathematical problems.  - Space is the boundless three-dimensional extent in which objects and events have relative position and direction. Physical space is often conceived in three linear dimensions, although modern physicists usually consider it, with time, to be part of a boundless four-dimensional continuum known as spacetime. The concept of space is considered to be of fundamental importance to an understanding of the physical universe. However, disagreement continues between philosophers over whether it is itself an entity, a relationship between entities, or part of a conceptual framework.  - Sir Isaac Newton (25 December 1642  20 March 1726/27) was an English mathematician, astronomer, and physicist (described in his own day as a \\"natural philosopher\\") who is widely recognised as one of the most influential scientists of all time and a key figure in the scientific revolution. His book \\"Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica\\" (\\"Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy\\"), first published in 1687, laid the foundations of classical mechanics. Newton also made seminal contributions to optics, and he shares credit with Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz for developing the infinitesimal calculus.  - A complex number is a number that can be expressed in the form , where and are real numbers and is the imaginary unit, satisfying the equation . In this expression, is the ' and is the ' of the complex number. If formula_1, then formula_2  - Quantity is a property that can exist as a magnitude or multitude. Quantities can be compared in terms of \\"more\\", \\"less\\", or \\"equal\\", or by assigning a numerical value in terms of a unit of measurement. Quantity is among the basic classes of things along with quality, substance, change, and relation. Some quantities are such by their inner nature (as number), while others are functioning as states (properties, dimensions, attributes) of things such as heavy and light, long and short, broad and narrow, small and great, or much and little. A small quantity is sometimes referred to as a quantulum.  - Mathematics (from Greek  \\"máthma\\", knowledge, study, learning) is the study of topics such as quantity (numbers), structure, space, and change.

The Black Sea has an area of (not including the Sea of Azov), a maximum depth of , and a volume of . It is constrained by the Pontic Mountains to the south and by the Caucasus Mountains to the east, and features a wide shelf to the northwest. The longest east-west extent is about .  - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries.  - Sivas (Latin: \\"Sebastia\\", \\"Sebastea\\", \\"Sebasteia\\", \\"Sebaste\\") is a city in central Turkey and the seat of Sivas Province. According to a 2011 estimate, its urban population is 425,297.  - The Bosphorus (or ) or Bosporus (\\"Bósporos\\" ) is a narrow, natural strait and an internationally significant waterway located in northwestern Turkey. It forms part of the continental boundary between Europe and Asia, and separates Asian Turkey from European Turkey. The world's narrowest strait used for international navigation, the Bosphorus connects the Black Sea with the Sea of Marmara, and, by extension via the Dardanelles, the Aegean and Mediterranean Seas.  - Eurasia is the combined continental landmass of Europe and Asia. The term is a portmanteau of its constituent continents. Located primarily in the Northern and Eastern Hemispheres, it is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the west, the Pacific Ocean to the east, the Arctic Ocean to the north, and by Africa, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Indian Ocean to the south. The division between Europe and Asia as two different continents is a historical and cultural construct, with no clear physical separation between them; thus, in some parts of the world, Eurasia is recognized as the largest of five or six continents. In geology, Eurasia is often considered as a single rigid megablock. However, the rigidity of Eurasia is debated based on the paleomagnet data.  - The Dardanelles, also known in Classical Antiquity as the Hellespont (\\"Hellespontos\\", literally \\"Sea of Helle\\"), is a narrow, natural strait and internationally-significant waterway in northwestern Turkey that forms part of the continental boundary between Europe and Asia, and separates Asian Turkey from European Turkey.

The Latin alphabet is derived from the Etruscan and Greek alphabets.  - The Sea of Marmara, also known as the Sea of Marmora or the Marmara Sea, and in the context of classical antiquity as the Propontis, is the inland sea, entirely within the borders of Turkey, that connects the Black Sea to the Aegean Sea, thus separating Turkey's Asian and European parts. The Bosphorus strait connects it to the Black Sea and the Dardanelles strait to the Aegean Sea. The former also separates Istanbul into its Asian and European sides. The sea has an area of 11,350 km² (280 km x 80 km) with the greatest depth reaching .  - Thrace (Modern , \\"Thráke\\" \\"Trakiya\\") is a historical and geographic area in southeast Europe, centered on the modern borders of Bulgaria, Greece, and Turkey. In antiquity, it was also referred to as Europe, prior to the extension of the term to describe the whole continent. As a geographical concept, Thrace designates a region bounded by the Balkan Mountains on the north, Rhodope Mountains and the Aegean Sea on the south, and by the Black Sea and the Sea of Marmara on the east. The areas it comprises are southeastern Bulgaria (Northern Thrace), northeastern Greece (Western Thrace), and the European part of Turkey (Eastern Thrace). The biggest part of Thrace is part of present-day Bulgaria. In Turkey, it is also called Rumeli. The name comes from the Thracians, an ancient Indo-European people inhabiting Southeastern Europe.  - A parliamentary republic is a republic that operates under a parliamentary system of government where the executive branch (the government) derives its legitimacy from and is accountable to the legislature (the parliament). There are a number of variations of parliamentary republics. Most have a clear differentiation between the head of government and the head of state, with the head of government holding real power, much like constitutional monarchies. Some have combined the roles of head of state and head of government, much like presidential systems, but with a dependency upon parliamentary power.  - Anatolia (from Greek , '  \\"east\\" or \\"(sun)rise\\"; in modern ), in geography known as Asia Minor (from '  \\"small Asia\\"; in modern ), Asian Turkey, Anatolian peninsula, or Anatolian plateau, is the westernmost protrusion of Asia, which makes up the majority of modern-day Turkey. The region is bounded by the Black Sea to the north, the Mediterranean Sea to the south, and the Aegean Sea to the west. The Sea of Marmara forms a connection between the Black and Aegean Seas through the Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits and separates Anatolia from Thrace on the European mainland.  - A wireless router is a device that performs the functions of a router and also includes the functions of a wireless access point. It is used to provide access to the Internet or a private computer network. It can function in a wired LAN (local area network), in a wireless-only LAN (WLAN), or in a mixed wired/wireless network, depending on the manufacturer and model.  - Western Asia, West Asia, Southwestern Asia or Southwest Asia is the westernmost subregion of Asia. The concept is in limited use, as it significantly overlaps with the Middle East (or Near East), the main difference being the exclusion of Egypt (which would be counted as part of North Africa).

Rebecca Hains says she was going through security at the airport in Las Vegas when a TSA agent pulled her aside and said the cupcake frosting was “gel-like” enough to constitute a security risk.      She said she was able to pass through Logan International Airport security with two cupcakes, but she was stopped on the way back when she tried to return with one of them.      \\"In general, cakes and pies are allowed in carry-on luggage,\\" said TSA spokesperson James Fotenos, adding they were looking into why this cupcake was confiscated.      Hains said she had received the cupcakes as a gift and after eating one on the trip out west, decided to save the other for the flight back.      Hains contacted the cupcake company, Wicked Good Cupcakes of Cohasset, which said it will ship her a new batch free of charge.      “Apparently we're a tasty, terrorist threat. I guess we were also amazed at what can pass through security in one airport, but not in another,” said Brian Vilagie of Wicked Good Cupcakes. ||||| A woman who just flew back home from Las Vegas says an airport security officer confiscated her frosted cupcake because he thought the icing on it could be a security risk.      Rebecca Hains said the Transportation Security Administration agent at McCarran International Airport took her cupcake Wednesday, telling her its frosting was enough like a gel to violate TSA restrictions on allowing liquids and gels onto flights to prevent them from being used as explosives.      \\"I just thought this was terrible logic,\\" Hains said Friday.      Hains, who lives in Peabody, just north of Boston, said the agent didn't seem concerned that the cupcake could actually be explosive, just that it fit some bureaucratic definition about what was prohibited. She said he even offered to let her eat it away from the airport security area.      Hains, a 35-year-old communications professor at Salem State University, said she told the agent she had passed through security at Boston's Logan International Airport earlier in the week with two cupcakes packaged in jars, gifts from a student. But she said the agent told her that just meant TSA in Boston didn't do its job.      The TSA, which is entrusted with protecting the nation's transportation system, was reviewing the incident, agency spokesman Nico Melendez said. Passengers are allowed to take cakes and cupcakes through checkpoints, he said.      Hains ultimately surrendered the cupcake. But she said the encounter highlighted a lack of common sense by the agent and the ludicrousness of TSA policies.      \\"It's not really about the cupcake; I can get another cupcake,\\" she said. \\"It's about an encroachment on civil liberties. We're just building up a resistance and tolerance to all these things they're doing in the name of security, when it's really theater.

Article: For parkour, you need to wear thin-soled shoes that have a one-piece sole. Thin soles let you feel the wall better, improving your technique, while one-piece soles won't rip off in pieces as easily. The shoe should have a well-defined arch to help you dig in your heels. It should also have a soft rubber for the best grip. If you want to learn parkour in a more controlled, safe environment, look for a parkour gym in your area. They'll have coaches on hand to help you learn the techniques. Basically, you are using your momentum to get up the wall. Therefore, you have to take the wall while jogging. Parkour is not for the faint of heart. You can fall or injure your ankles while trying to do parkour. As you reach the wall, push off the ground with your non-dominant leg. You should be close enough to the wall that you can easily hit it with the other leg. In other words, you need to be within a foot or two. Basically, you are trying to push yourself as far up the wall as you can. Immediately as you get to the wall, push your arms up. You need to be ready when you approach the top of the wall to grasp it. Using the ball of your foot, plant your foot on the wall. Use that foot to change your horizontal motion to vertical motion, pushing yourself up the wall. As you do, be sure to lean in towards the wall, as it will keep you moving upwards rather than away from the wall. Using your non-dominant leg, run another step up the wall. Basically, you're still trying to get as far up the wall as you can. All of these steps must be done in quick succession. You can take a third step, but more than three steps is probably pushing it. Grab the top of the wall with both hands. Pull yourself upwards. As you reach the top, push yourself like you're climbing out of the pool. You can then simply push until you can put your foot on the wall and stand up. Alternatively, you can swing a leg up to the side, pushing it over and drop down the other side of the wall.

Pub: It was the pub that first introduced the concept of the bar counter being used to serve the beer. Until that time beer establishments used to bring the beer out to the table or benches, as remains the practice in (for example) beer gardens and other drinking establishments in Germany. A bar might be provided for the manager to do paperwork while keeping an eye on his or her customers, but the casks of ale were kept in a separate taproom. When the first pubs were built, the main room was the public room with a large serving bar copied from the gin houses, the idea being to serve the maximum number of people in the shortest possible time. It became known as the public bar[citation needed]. The other, more private, rooms had no serving bar—they had the beer brought to them from the public bar. There are a number of pubs in the Midlands or the North which still retain this set up but these days the beer is fetched by the customer from the taproom or public bar. One of these is The Vine, known locally as The Bull and Bladder, in Brierley Hill near Birmingham, another the Cock at Broom, Bedfordshire a series of small rooms served drinks and food by waiting staff. In the Manchester district the public bar was known as the \\"vault\\", other rooms being the lounge and snug as usual elsewhere.

Paragraph: The accumulation of [3H]noradrenaline ([3H]NA) and its oxidation products was studied in primary cultures of cerebral astrocytes. Astroglial accumulation of radiolabeled catecholamine ([3H] NA and oxidation products) was enhanced by manganese or iron, but it was inhibited by unlabeled NA, dopamine or ascorbate. Tissue:medium ratios of radioactivity increased as extracellular [3H]NA was oxidized. When extracellular oxidation was prevented by ascorbate, as confirmed by high performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection, either ouabain pretreatment or nominally Na*-free incubation medium inhibited approximately one-half of specific [3H]NA accumulation by rat (but not mouse) astrocytes. These observations suggest that neurological responses to trace metals and ascorbate may arise from the effects of these agents on the clearance of extracellular catecholamines. Astrocytes can accumulate oxidation products of NA more rapidly than they take up NA itself, but ascorbate at physiological concentrations prevents the oxidation process in extracellular fluid. Furthermore, in the presence of ascorbate, Na+-dependent transport mediates a significant component of NA accumulation in rat astrocytes.

Monteux believed that the trouble began when the two factions   began attacking each other, but their mutual anger was soon diverted towards the orchestra: \\"Everything available was tossed in our direction, but we continued to play on\\". Around forty of the worst offenders were ejected—possibly with the intervention of the police, although this is uncorroborated. Through all the disturbances the performance continued without interruption. The unrest receded significantly during Part II, and by some accounts Maria Piltz's rendering of the final \\"Sacrificial Dance\\" was watched in reasonable silence. At the end there were several curtain calls for the dancers, for Monteux and the orchestra, and for Stravinsky and Nijinsky before the evening's programme continued.Among the more hostile press reviews was that of Le Figaro's critic, Henri Quittard, who called the work \\"a laborious and puerile barbarity\\" and added \\"We are sorry to see an artist such as M. Stravinsky involve himself in this disconcerting adventure\\". On the other hand, Gustav Linor, writing in the leading theatrical magazine Comoedia, thought the performance was superb, especially that of Maria Piltz; the disturbances, while deplorable, were merely \\"a rowdy debate\\" between two ill-mannered factions.

Neilston is represented by several tiers of elected government. Neilston Community Council forms the lowest tier of governance whose statutory role is to communicate local opinion to local and central government. It is one of ten community councils of the East Renfrewshire council area. East Renfrewshire Council, the unitary local authority for Neilston, is based at Giffnock, close to the border with the City of Glasgow, and is the executive, deliberative and legislative body responsible for local governance. The Scottish Parliament is responsible for devolved matters such as education, health and justice, while reserved matters are dealt with by the Parliament of the United Kingdom. The territory of what became Neilston anciently formed part of the Kingdom of Strathclyde. It has lain within the county boundaries of Renfrewshire from a very early time. Neilston emerged as a parish and administrative unit in 1170, and was for many years under the lordship of the Mures of Caldwell whose tombs are at the parish church. The parish was 8 miles (13 km) in length and by from 2 miles (3 km) to 4 miles (6 km) in breadth, encompassing six sevenths of what is now the town of Barrhead. Neilston Parish Council, a local body with limited power, was established in 1895, following the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1894, and abolished in 1930 following the Local Government (Scotland) Act 1929. In 1890, Neilston fell under the authority of Renfrewshire County Council, where it remained until 1975 when the county was superseded by the regional council area of Strathclyde. In 1903, Neilston was within the Paisley Small Debt Court District and Poor Combination. From 1975 to 1996, Neilston was in the Renfrew District of Strathclyde until the two-tier regions and districts of Scotland were abolished.

Options: - pizza - squashed - refrigerator - market - on pizza  Explain why a human would choose \\"market\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","output":"A human would choose \\"market\\" as the answer to the question above because: Step 1: Analyze the options and eliminate irrelevant choices. - Pizza and on pizza: These options relate to a food item that uses tomatoes as an ingredient, but they don't provide information about the freshness of the tomatoes. - Squashed: This option refers to the physical state of a tomato, which is not relevant to the freshness. Step 2: Compare the remaining relevant options and choose the best fit. - Refrigerator: While storing tomatoes in a refrigerator might help maintain their freshness, the options do not specify how long the tomatoes have been inside. They may not be the freshest available. - Market: This option refers to a place where fresh produce, including tomatoes, is commonly sold. At a market, tomatoes can be sourced from local farms, ensuring that they are freshly picked. Additionally, markets typically stock produce that is currently in season, further increasing the likelihood of finding the freshest tomatoes. In conclusion, a human would choose \\"market\\" because it is the place where they are most likely to find the freshest tomatoes, based on the possible sources of produce and the assurance of them being freshly picked and in season."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What would be an example of an 1. review?","output":"An example of a negative review would be if a customer experiences an overall unsatisfactory experience with a product or service, which may include aspects such as poor customer service, low-quality product, or unmet expectations. Here is a detailed, negative review of a hypothetical restaurant called \\"The Gourmet Bistro.\\" Title: Disappointing Experience at The Gourmet Bistro I had high expectations for The Gourmet Bistro, considering the rave reviews I had heard from friends and the promising reputation that preceded it. Unfortunately, my recent visit to the restaurant was a major disappointment and left me regretting my choice to dine there. From the moment we walked in, it was apparent that the staff was overwhelmed and poorly organized. Despite having made a reservation in advance, we had to wait for approximately 30 minutes to be seated at our table. Once seated, it took another 20 minutes for our waiter to bring the menus and take our drink orders. In retrospect, the long wait times were an early red flag, signaling the beginning of our frustrating experience. When it came to food selection, I was unimpressed by the limited range of options on the menu. The restaurant prides itself on serving \\"gourmet\\" cuisine, yet a majority of the dishes seemed generic, lacking any creativity or innovation to truly make them stand out. I ordered the grilled salmon with seasonal vegetables, anticipating a flavorful and well-crafted dish. Regrettably, the salmon was overcooked and dry, while the vegetables were swimming in an unnecessarily copious amount of butter. The accompanying sauce did little to salvage the dish, as it tasted store-bought rather than house-made. Furthermore, the wait times between courses were excessive and resulted in a prolonged and tedious dining experience. Considering the restaurant was not fully packed that evening, it was difficult to understand why the kitchen struggled to deliver dishes in a timely manner. When our dessert finally arrived, my chocolate soufflé was not baked thoroughly and visibly collapsed upon contact with my spoon. Needless to say, it was a disappointing conclusion to an already underwhelming meal. To make matters worse, the overall atmosphere in The Gourmet Bistro was far from enjoyable. The excessive noise from the nearby bar area and crowded seating made it challenging to hold a conversation with my dining partner. Additionally, the dim lighting was not conducive to comfortably reading the menu or observing the presentation of the food. Considering the high prices of the dishes and the restaurant's reputable status, I expected a more pleasant and upscale environment. In conclusion, my experience at The Gourmet Bistro was far from the exceptional dining adventure I had anticipated. The combination of poor customer service, subpar food quality, lengthy wait times, and an uncomfortable atmosphere left me feeling profoundly dissatisfied. Based on this visit, I cannot in good conscience recommend The Gourmet Bistro to anyone seeking an enjoyable and refined dining experience. It is my hope that the restaurant's management will address these issues to bring its performance up to par with the expectations set by its self-proclaimed \\"gourmet\\" image."},{"instruction":"You are presented with the question \\"How does heat make an object hot?\\" and the following answer choices:  - temperature  - high  - transfer  - It expands  - frozen  - Evaporation  - electricity  - sunlight  Now knowing that if heat is conducted to an object then that object will become hot and conductive heat transfer is excellent, choose the best answer.

The equation is given as:  228*d + 2814 = -214*d - 27*d. First, let's combine the terms with 'd' on the right side of the equation: -214*d - 27*d = (-214 - 27) * d = -241*d Now, the equation looks like this: 228*d + 2814 = -241*d. We can now move all 'd' terms to the left side of the equation by adding 241*d on both sides: 228*d + 241*d + 2814 = 0 (228 + 241) * d + 2814 = 0 469 * d + 2814 = 0 Now, we have only one term with 'd' on the left side of the equation. To isolate 'd' and find its value, let's move 2814 to the right side of the equation by subtracting it from both sides: 469*d = -2814 Now, we can find the value of 'd' by dividing both sides of the equation by 469: d = -2814 / 469 Now, evaluating the fraction, we get: d ≈ -6 Hence, the solution to the given math problem is d ≈ -6."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

He researched the yoga clothing market, studied analyst reports and consulted with his sister. \\"It was the right mesh of two worlds for us,\\" she said. Their goal was to elevate yogawear to a product that would honor the culture of yoga and serve as a \\"gym-to-life\\" product that a consumer could wear to yoga practice and beyond. \\"I think we really had the foresight four years ago to say hey, this is where the activewear market is going,\\" Tapasya said. \\"The more we talked about it, the more convinced we became that this was an idea that really had legs.\\" In 2010, Rishi left finance to pursue the venture full time, while Tapasya remained in her role at Creduit Suisse as they fine-tuned their business plan.

Here is a news article: Bar Marco has been rocking the boat since it launched—with a restaurant that has been recognized nationally not only for its inventive food but also for its focus on community programming. And as it turns three this year, it shows no signs of stopping. On January 2, the restaurant tweeted some pretty groundbreaking news.      With this move, Bar Marco leads with a handful of restaurants in the country—including Thomas Keller’s and Daniel Patterson’s restaurant groups—opting to eschew tipping in favor of offering their staff not only a living wage but the stability that is hard to come by when your take home pay depends on tips.      The minimum wage for tipped workers in Pennsylvania is 2.83. According to a recent Mother Jones article, up to 40 percent of restaurant workers live in near-poverty and less than 15 percent of restaurant workers have employer-sponsored health insurance compared to 42 percent for other industries.      “We’ve been watching the data all year. I put together what we have to do to pay the front and back equally and pay them well and give them a share of the upsides,” says Bar Marco co-owner, Bobby Fry.      Bar Marco will not be adding a service charge to diners’ checks nor will the prices suddenly increase significantly.      “Every restaurant does it a little bit differently. Some restaurants charge a 20 percent service fee—I don’t think that will work well for us,” says Fry. “Our plan hinges on hitting revenues—mainly the expansion of the wine room where gratuity and tax have been included since it launched.”      Instead of the current two ticketed seatings, the restaurant will now take reservations. “Six courses for 65, plus wine pairings for an additional 40,” says Fry. “We have also put together a great team in the kitchen. Our menu will change subtly—with dishes that offer more depth.”      All employees at Bar Marco will work 40-44 hours a week maximum—with two days off, plus one night, since the restaurant is closed on Sundays. On top of that, employees get 10 vacation days. Each employee will be paid 35,000 a year base salary, plus health care from date of hire and 500 shares in the business that will vest after three months of employment. Every share is worth 1 after three months and it increases in value as it matures.      “All of our current employees have seen and approved the contract,” says Fry. “They will have a lot of responsibilities, too—like being present at bi-monthly finance meetings. We want complete transparency. We want people who want to be part of what we are doing and who want to grow with us.”      What is the public’s reaction to this news? The tweet in the image featured here had over 300 retweets and favorites.      Still want to leave a gesture of appreciation for the good service you receive? Please do. When the new structure launches, tips at Bar Marco will go toward the Food Revolution Pittsburgh Cooking Club. ||||| Is the the future of the restaurant industry tip-free? One Pittsburgh restaurant certainly thinks so. The owners of three-year-old Bar Marco are not only abolishing tips, but are giving their employees a salary with benefits. According to Next Pittsburgh, full-time employees will be paid a base salary of 35,000 a year and will be given health care and 500 shares in the company. Employees will be asked to work a maximum of 40 to 44 hours per week, will have two days and one night off a week, and will receive 10 paid vacation days per year. Co-owner Robert Fry tells Eater, \\"America needs to realize that working in the restaurant industry is an occupation.\\" Fry worked with long-term employees to create the plan.      Fry notes that by April of this year, 20 of the restaurant's employees — both front and back of house — will be switched over to salary and that the restaurant will no longer accept tips. There will still be a handful of part-time employees, \\"mainly college students,\\" says Fry, that will work as servers' assistants and will be paid 10 to 12 dollars per hour. Unlike other restaurants that have eliminated tipping, Bar Marco will not be adding in a service fee or raising their prices. Instead, the co-owners are hoping to grow revenue by expanding their menu, increasing the number of covers they do in their wine room, and upping the number of events they host.      Fry tells Eater that all employees are on board and have signed contracts. He told Next Pittsburgh that with the salary comes other expectations: They will have a lot of responsibilities, too like being present at bi-monthly finance meetings. We want complete transparency. We want people who want to be part of what we are doing and who want to grow with us.\\"      Back in June, another Pennsylvania restaurant announced that it would ban tipping. The co-owners of Bistro Girard decided that they would pay their waitstaff a \\"living wage\\" of 11 per hour and offer them full benefits as well as profit sharing. To offset the costs, the restaurant would raise prices by 10 to 20 percent. ||||| The seed for this crawl was a list of every host in the Wayback Machine      This crawl was run at a level 1 (URLs including their embeds, plus the URLs of all outbound links including their embeds)      The WARC files associated with this crawl are not currently available to the general public. ||||| A summary of this is?","output":"Bar Marco, a restaurant in Pittsburgh, is making some big changes.

Summarize this article: Marble is very soft and prone to damage so it is important to apply a coat of high quality marble sealing agent before proceeding with the grout. This seal is also important because marble is very porous and grout can cause stains in the tiles.  Apply the sealing agent over the tops of the marble. Even if you prefer the color and look of unsealed marble you can use a “grout release”-type sealer to prevent grout from sticking to the marble tiles. Grout, or mortar, will be used ot fill in the spaces between the tiles. Be sure to wear a dust mask, safety goggles, and heavy-duty work gloves. Wear a long-sleeve shirt to avoid any possible damage to your skin from contact with the grout. Mix only enough as will be used in 15-20 minutes of work or else the extra can dry out and harden. This prepares the spaces for the grout or mortar. Spread the concrete evenly over the spaces between the tiles using a squeegee. Be careful to avoid getting cement on the tops of the tiles. Some will inevitably get on top of the tiles but you want to minimize the amount.  Try to push it into the spaces as much as possible to create a tight fight. Wipe up any grout on top of the tiles as you go. Use a squeegee to spread out the grout and leave a smooth surface in the cracks. You can also use a gloved finger to run down the grooves and smooth the top of the grout. Use a damp sponge to wipe down the tops of the tiles to remove any excess grout. Try not to get extra moisture into the grout or else it can make it too wet. Allow the grout to dry for the length of time required by the manufacturer. Some will require long curing times to ensure maximum strength. Use a disposable sponge applicator to paint the grout with a grout sealer. This will help prevent stains and dirt from permanently discoloring the grout. It will also make cleaning easier later on. Clean your tools with water or acetone to remove the excess grout or mortar and prepare them for use once again.

An argument is being made that Goldman Sach's famous marketing device  , the BRICs, should really be the BICs. \\"Is Russia really worth the name BRICs?\\" asks Anders Aslund, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, in an article for Foreign Policy. Aslund, who is also co-author with Andrew Kuchins of \\"The Russian Balance Sheet\\", thinks the Russia of Putin and Medvedev is just not worthy of inclusion alongside Brazil, India and China in the list of future economic powerhouses. He writes: \\"The country's economic performance has fallen to such a weak level that one must ask whether it has any say at all on the global economy, compared with the other members of its group. I have just returned from Moscow, which is always dull around this season. For the last seven years, Russia has taken very few measures to improve its economy. Instead, the state has been living on oil and gas.\\" Economically, Aslund has the numbers on his side. The International Monetary Fund figures that the Russian economy will fall by 6.7 percent in 2009, while China will grow 8.5 percent and India 5.4 percent. There is less of a case for Brazil, with a fall of 0.7 percent, but it is still doing far better than Russia. But the BRICs are not just about economy. As is mentioned above, it is a marketing device to encourage investors   to focus on the big promising players. From an investment standpoint, it could be argued that Russia is leading the BRICs.

The novel begins in England during the Age of Enlightenment but long before the days of Darwin and the Slavery Abolition Act 1833. The novel is broken into two books, beginning in 1752 and 1753 and ending in 1765, with a decade or so separating the two. Matthew Paris is a central character in the novel, a physician several years older than his cousin Erasmus. Prior to the beginning of the story Paris had been imprisoned for writings on the age of the earth that clashed with a literal interpretation of the Bible, his wife Ruth dying while he was incarcerated. Wishing to escape his past, he accepts a position as surgeon on the Liverpool Merchant, a slave ship built and owned by his uncle William Kemp. The elder Kemp's son, Erasmus Kemp, a young man in his early twenties, has a long-standing hatred for his cousin dating back to his younger years. He participates in a play initially, and is enamored with seventeen-year-old Sarah Wolpert, the daughter of a friend of his father. The ship's crew is made up of men available at the time around the Liverpool docks, and many are recruited by blackmail and deception. As the ship sets off toward the African continent to collect its cargo, it becomes clear that Paris and the ship's captain, Saul Thurso, have very different world views.

Break down the first question: \\"Is life really what I make of it?\\"    - This question is asking whether or not an individual's life is determined by the choices, actions, and perspectives that they hold. It is seeking confirmation about the level of personal control someone has over their own life. 2. Break down the second question: \\"Life is what you make it?\\"    - This question is phrased as a statement, but with the addition of a question mark, it indicates that the speaker is seeking confirmation or agreement from the respondent. It is essentially asking if life is determined by the choices, actions, and perspectives that someone holds. 3. Compare both questions:    - They both revolve around the same concept: the influence of personal choice, action, and perspective on determining the course of one's life.    - They are presented differently, with the first one being a more personal inquiry, and the second one being a more general one.

Q:Information:  - The Luna programme (from the Russian word  \\"Luna\\" meaning \\"Moon\\"), occasionally called \\"Lunik\\" or \\"Lunnik\\" by western media, was a series of robotic spacecraft missions sent to the Moon by the Soviet Union between 1959 and 1976. Fifteen were successful, each designed as either an orbiter or lander, and accomplished many firsts in space exploration. They also performed many experiments, studying the Moon's chemical composition, gravity, temperature, and radiation.  - A spacecraft is a vehicle, or machine designed to fly in outer space. Spacecraft are used for a variety of purposes, including communications, earth observation, meteorology, navigation, space colonization, planetary exploration, and transportation of humans and cargo.  - The Solar System is the gravitationally bound system comprising the Sun and the objects that orbit it, either directly or indirectly. Of those objects that orbit the Sun directly, the largest eight are the planets, with the remainder being significantly smaller objects, such as dwarf planets and small Solar System bodies. Of the objects that orbit the Sun indirectly, the moons, two are larger than the smallest planet, Mercury.  - In physics, an orbit is the gravitationally curved path of an object around a point in space, for example the orbit of a planet about a star or a natural satellite around a planet. Normally, orbit refers to a regularly repeating path around a body, although it may occasionally be used for a non recurring trajectory or a path around a point in space. To a close approximation, planets and satellites follow elliptical orbits, with the central mass being orbited at a focal point of the ellipse, as described by Kepler's laws of planetary motion.  - Luna 3, or E-2A No.1 was a Soviet spacecraft launched in 1959 as part of the Luna programme. It was the first-ever mission to photograph the far side of the Moon. It was also the third space probe to be sent to the neighborhood of the Moon. Though it returned rather poor pictures by later standards, the historic, never-before-seen views of the far side of the Moon caused excitement and interest when they were published around the world, and a tentative \\"Atlas of the Far Side of the Moon\\" was created after image processing improved the pictures.  - A circumlunar trajectory, trans-lunar trajectory or lunar free return is a type of free return trajectory which takes a spacecraft from Earth, around the far side of the Moon, and back to Earth using only gravity once the initial trajectory is set.  - The Moon is an astronomical body that orbits planet Earth, being Earth's only permanent natural satellite. It is the fifth-largest natural satellite in the Solar System, and the largest among planetary satellites relative to the size of the planet that it orbits (its primary). Following Jupiter's satellite Io, the Moon is second-densest satellite among those whose densities are known.   - Luna E- 3 No.1 , sometimes identified by NASA as Luna 1960A , was a Soviet spacecraft which was lost in a launch failure in 1960 . It was a 279 - kilogram ( 615 lb ) Luna E- 3 spacecraft , the first of two to be launched , both of which were lost in launch failures . It was intended to fly around the Moon on a circumlunar trajectory in order to image the surface of the Moon , including the far side . The E- 3 spacecraft were similar in design to the E- 2A which had been used for the earlier Luna 3 mission . However , they carried higher resolution cameras , and were intended to make closer flybys .  - The far side of the Moon is the hemisphere of the Moon that always faces away from Earth. The far side's terrain is rugged, with a multitude of impact craters and relatively few flat lunar maria. It has one of the largest craters in the Solar System, the South PoleAitken basin. Although both sides of the moon experience two weeks of sunlight followed by two weeks of night, the far side is also referred to as the dark side of the Moon, originally in the sense of \\"unknown\\" rather than lack of light.  - A planet is an astronomical body orbiting a star or stellar remnant that The term \\"planet\\" is ancient, with ties to history, astrology, science, mythology, and religion. Several planets in the Solar System can be seen with the naked eye. These were regarded by many early cultures as divine, or as emissaries of deities. As scientific knowledge advanced, human perception of the planets changed, incorporating a number of disparate objects. In 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) officially adopted a resolution defining planets within the Solar System. This definition is controversial because it excludes many objects of planetary mass based on where or what they orbit. Although eight of the planetary bodies discovered before 1950 remain \\"planets\\" under the modern definition, some celestial bodies, such as Ceres, Pallas, Juno and Vesta (each an object in the solar asteroid belt), and Pluto (the first trans-Neptunian object discovered), that were once considered planets by the scientific community, are no longer viewed as such.  - A free-return trajectory is a trajectory of a spacecraft traveling away from a primary body (for example, the Earth) where gravity due to a secondary body (for example, the Moon) causes the spacecraft to return to the primary body without propulsion (hence the term \\"free\\").  - Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the Solar System. It is a giant planet with a mass one-thousandth that of the Sun, but two and a half times that of all the other planets in the Solar System combined. Jupiter is a gas giant, along with Saturn, with the other two giant planets, Uranus and Neptune, being ice giants. Jupiter was known to astronomers of ancient times. The Romans named it after their god Jupiter. When viewed from Earth, Jupiter can reach an apparent magnitude of 2.94, bright enough for its reflected light to cast shadows, and making it on average the third-brightest object in the night sky after the Moon and Venus.

A new 200mph British supercar has broken cover with a scintillating £800,000 price-tag to match. The new flagship two-seater McLaren P1 will accelerate from rest to 62mph in under three seconds and is set to be one of the stars of next week’s Paris Motor Show. The super-lightweight but powerful supercar is being built at McLaren’s state of the art factory in Woking, Surrey and has the ambition of being the best road and track car in the world for drivers. It is about the same size as a Porsche 911 but is being seen as the spiritual successor of the legendary three-seater Mclaren F1 supercar of the 1990s – one of which ‘Mr Bean’ star Rowan Atkinson famously pranged. State-of-the-art: The super-lightweight but powerful supercar (pictured) is being built at McLaren's factory in Woking, Surrey. 'One simple goal': Manufacturers have described the vehicle as the best  driver's car on the road. A McLaren spokesman said: ‘McLaren Automotive will use its first ever international motor show appearance to preview its next generation ultimate supercar – the McLaren P1 – which takes much of its technological and spiritual inspiration from the company’s Racing division. ‘The McLaren P1 has one simple goal: to be the best driver’s car in the world on road and track.’ A prototype of the P1 car is to go on show in Paris next Thursday  with a production version to follow and go on sale in September next year. Weight is kept down thanks to its super-strong but very light carbon-fibre structure. McLaren Automotive executive chairman Ron Dennis said:‘The McLaren P1 will be the result of 50 years of racing and road car heritage. ‘Twenty years ago we raised the supercar performance bar with the McLaren F1 and our goal with the McLaren P1 is to redefine it once again.’ Hot wheels: The P1 is seen as the spiritual successor of the legendary three-seater Mclaren F1 supercar of the 1990s (pictured) Counting the cost: This was what was left of Rowan Atkinson's £640,000 McLaren F1 sports car after a prang in 2011. McLaren automotive managing director Antony Sheriff said; ‘Our aim is not necessarily to be the fastest in absolute top speed but to be the quickest and most rewarding series production road car on a circuit.’ He added:’It is the true test of a supercar’s all round ability and a much more important technical statement. Our goal is to make the McLaren P1 the most exciting, most capable, most technologically advanced and most dynamically accomplished supercar ever made.’ When the flagship McLaren P1 goes into production later next year, it will sit above the existing 12C and 12C Spider, in terms of both price and performance with a price of around £800,000. Rowan Atkinson during the British Grand Prix at Silverstone Circuit. The comedian crashed his supercar last year. Johnny English star Rowan Atkinson spoke in September last year about the £1million crash that wrecked his own original McLaren F1 supercar noting: ’I can’t blame the car’, he confessed ruefully. ‘It was wet.‘. And so high was the expected repair bill he added: ’I haven’t had the estimate. But I have had the estimate for the estimate.’ His Woking-built supercar is capable of 230mph, and accelerates from 0-60mph in 3.2 seconds. He was hurt when he crashed the three-seater McLaren F1 supercar into a tree in Cambridgeshire in early August 2011. The Blackadder and Mr Bean star suffered a shoulder injury and wounded pride in the accident, near Peterborough. He walked from the car, which caught fire, after the crash on the A605 at Haddon and waited for an ambulance. Atkinson, 56, was admitted to Peterborough City Hospital but later discharged with ‘a minor shoulder injury’ following the crash. Only a few weeks earlier,  he had staunchly defended the McLaren to Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson: ’You've got to live with it. I have lived with it for 14 years, I've done a lot of miles in it, I've done 37,000 miles – which for a McLaren is a lot.’. He even  loaned the car to the programme on a previous occasion, when it was driven by another Top Gear presenter Richard Hammond without incident. In 1999, Atkinson damaged the bonnet of the car in a low speed shut. In 1995 former BMW boss  Dr Bernd Pischetsrieder, himself wrote-off a McLaren F1 in 1995 when he was head of the German car giant. That he and his passengers survived was put down to the strength of the car’s carbon-fibre space-frame.

He believes that a loophole in Santander's security system was exploited by fraudsters. But Santander said that victims failed to keep a passcode private. One of these victims was Alex Luke, from London, who had £180,000 stolen from her account. \\"I had a call from someone I thought was BT,\\" she told the BBC. \\"They had all my personal details and they said that they needed to put security on to my computer to prevent me losing everything. \\"So they got me to log on to my Santander account and get a security code.\\" She later discovered that nearly all of her money had gone from her account. Her bank managed to recover £40,000 but Santander refuses to compensate her for the rest of the missing money. Mr Emery, who runs 4keys International, argued that there was a loophole that allowed fraudsters, posing as BT, to gain access to the money - and others had suffered the same fate. \\"If Santander customers create a new account payee, they have to authorise it with a One-Time Passcode system or OTP. But there was a huge loophole - you could amend an existing payee, changing their account and sort code numbers,\\" he said. \\"All other banks prevent a change to existing payees' account details. They should now compensate all customers affected. Whilst the customer holds the first key to the door, Santander holds the second key and in these cases they left the door open and the crooks exploited it.\\" But Santander does not agree. \\"We refute Mr Emery's position that there is a loophole,\\" a spokesman said. \\"The security for amending a payee and a new payee was the same. If the customers had not given access to their account and shared their individual one-time passcode with a third party, then they would not have lost their money.\\" However, within three weeks of Mr Emery's objections, which were broadcast on BBC Radio 4's Money Box, Santander had upgraded its security. Mr Emery said he was planning to take a group case to the Financial Ombudsman or, if that failed, file a collective civil action against Santander. Fraudsters are continually changing the way they target bank customers, according to Action Fraud - the UK's national reporting centre for fraud and cyber-crime. Thieves have been stealing large sums of money from victims' bank accounts by intercepting calls, or tricking people into revealing details of texts sent by banks, as in the case of Alex Luke. Meanwhile, many companies are having their coffers emptied by scam emails, such as community football club Laurel Park FC, in Lower Earley, near Reading in Berkshire, which supports 400 young players in 27 youth teams. It was conned out of nearly £30,000 when the club's treasurer received what seemed to be a genuine email from the chairman along with invoices from a supplier, which he paid. But the account details were those of a fraudster and despite pleading with their bank, Barclays, the club has taken a big financial hit and faced closure Ian Jobson, the club's development officer, said: \\"Because we requested the payments to be made, Barclays believed we were liable for the loss. The fraudsters got away with it.\\" Barclays said they had already warned businesses and community projects of rising \\"CEO fraud\\". \\"This scam is a tragic case of criminal theft by a fraudster impersonating the chairman in an email to an employee within his business. We acted swiftly to recover any funds that remained in Barclays accounts at the time this was reported. We hope that the police urgently investigate this matter and bring the criminal to justice,\\" the bank said.

Context: The popularity of lip pencils and crayons is soaring, I suspect it’s because they’re just so easy to use. I’ve been trying out two new ones to see which I prefer. In the red corner we have MAC Patent Polish Lip Pencil and in the blue corner we have NARS Velvet Matte Lip Pencil. So let’s get ready to rumble while I put them through their paces…. Although the packaging of these two is quite similar the formulation and finish of the lip colours are very different – MAC Patent Polish is a light gloss and NARS Velvet Matte has a stark matte finish. So whether you prefer your lips sheer and glossy or pigmented and matte there should be something for everyone here. MAC Patent Polish Lip Pencil – this is the first lip pencil that I’ve tried from MAC (apart from lip liner) and I’m really impressed with it. As the name suggests the finish is a very shiny gloss that gives an almost patent shine, it has the feel of a lip gloss but it’s not sticky. The colour is called Spontaneous, MAC describe it as a ‘soft plum with pearl’. It’s definitely a plummy shade, although I can’t really detect any pearl in there. It looks quite dark as a crayon but as it’s very sheer it appears much more natural once it’s on the lips. It’s a great way to introduce darker lip colours to your make-up bag if you’re not used to them. MAC Patent Polish Lip Pencil is a bit like a fabulous giant tinted lip balm! The crayon itself is chunky and easy to hold, the nib is quite chunky and not great for precision application, but you could use a lip brush to apply it. I love to apply MAC Patent Polish straight from the crayon, it’s quick and easy, and as it’s very light and sheer it’s easy to wipe away any mistakes and re-apply. Question: What does the narrator most likely think that MAC Patent Polish Lip Pencil should do with the plum color she bought? Options:  A. Make it more pigmented and less shiny  B. Reformulate it to have more pearl in the color like it's advertised to have  C. Create a strictly plum color and a strictly pearl color  D. not enough information Answer:","output":"B.

True story: Some time ago, a Dutch TV station made an announcement that they were going to air a new reality show. A contest rather. The main participant in this show would be a woman who was dying of something terrible and she would be donating her kidneys to one lucky person with progressive kidney failure. For real. The country and the international media were all over this story like flies on a turd, saying it was appalling, immoral, what-is-this-world-coming-to, and the like. In a way, I had to agree. As the months passed, the tension built up to a degree that the government was mostly occupied by the issue of whether they should let this show go ahead or not, instead of running the country. The show did air and right up to the last moment they were pushing ahead. And up to the last moment the country was up in arms, the Prime Minister making speeches, every newspaper writing about it, everyone in the country holding their breaths. And the network pushed on. Towards a new frontier in television. And they definitely succeeded in doing just that. They pushed the envelope. The show aired and we all watched a terminally ill woman selecting the right candidate to receive her kidneys so he or she would live, whilst she would die shortly after. And then, in the last moments of the show it was revealed that it was a partial hoax. The woman was not ill, but all the candidates were. There was no kidney auction. The whole show, that, with the publicity and the commercials and all the discussions, built up for months to a fantastic climax, was a publicity stunt to focus attention on the problem of major shortages in organ donors. The man who founded this particular network himself died of kidney disease. Now THIS is television. Leaving everybody far behind in amazement. Don't give me a poorly acted, poorly directed flick about some woman trying to get a Russian Roulette show on American TV. As if. *Spoiler* As if I'm going to believe they would get this through the FCC. As if I'm going to believe this would get through the US Supreme Court on the basis of free expression. As if I'm gonna believe the ridiculous ending where this woman pulled it off and has conscience issues because some guy shot himself on air. It's all been done before. Watch Running Man with Arnold instead. At least it had a semi good ending. *Spoiler* This is an appallingly bad piece of film, together with a ridiculous ending. So she gets shot in the end, is that supposed to make us movie going public feel better after we leave the theater because there was some kind of justice?

Lieutenant Wadakura dismisses the allegation and suspects that the murder is the work of a Yakuza syndicate. Paul is approached by Ijuro Takeda, an expert on the cult and Kinjo. Paul discovers that Takeda is the last in a samurai line and has a score to settle with Kinjo. The ninjas attempts to murder Paul at the hospital, killing several hospital staff and police officers, including Wadakura, but Paul escapes. Takeda and his wife Mieko subsequently take Paul to their family's stronghold, located on an island several hundred miles away.

Paddy saw Lightfoot almost as soon as he stepped out on the bank. He kept right on swimming with the branch of a poplar-tree until he reached his food pile, which, you know, is in the water. There he forced the branch down until it was held by other branches already sunken in the pond. This done, he swam over to where Lightfoot was watching. \\"Hello, Lightfoot!\\" he exclaimed. \\"You are looking handsomer than ever. How are you feeling these fine autumn days?\\"  \\"Anxious,\\" replied Lightfoot. \\"I am feeling terribly anxious. Do you know what day this is?\\"  \\"No,\\" replied Paddy, \\"I don't know what day it is, and I don't particularly care.

Context: Larisa Grollemond is conducting a comparative study of illuminations in the Mirror of History (Speculum historiale, Miroir historial) as a graduate intern in the Manuscripts Department of the Getty Museum. The massive text, compiled in the 1200s by friar Vincent of Beauvais and translated into French in the 14th century by Jean de Vignay, attempts to compile all of world history from creation to the present into a single source. “If our twenty-first-century way of understanding everything is to put it on the Internet,” she says, “the medieval way of understanding was to create big encyclopedic texts that try to encompass all of human history and biblical history in an organized way.” Larisa, who recently completed her PhD at the University of Pennsylvania with a focus on 15th-century French manuscript culture, is focusing on the Getty volumes’ unique program of illuminations. The French translation of the Miroir historial exists in some 40 known copies, and while the text remains mostly unchanged from copy to copy, the illuminations vary dramatically, both in how scenes are depicted and in which episodes artists choose to depict. Larisa has decided to focus on the evolution of depictions of India and its inhabitants across these various copies, because the Getty copy, which dates to 1475, contains images that are different from earlier illuminated versions. While other copies don’t dedicate more than one or two illustrations to India, the Getty copy has several that draw upon the medieval tradition of the “monstrous peoples” as well as knowledge of geography, materials, and customs newly gained through trade. This work ties into broader scholarly efforts to shed light on globalization in the Middle Ages. “Scholars of medieval art have generally thought of Western Europe as the center and non-European places as the periphery. There has now been a revision of that view,” says Larisa. “These manuscripts provide an interesting glimpse into how late-medieval Europeans made sense of their world, including...

Context: Most patients are admitted to the hospital through the emergency department (ED), and ED waiting times partly reflect the availability of inpatient beds. We test whether the balance between daily hospital admissions and discharges affects next-day ED length of stay.', 'We conducted a cross-sectional study of hospitals in metropolitan Toronto, served by a single emergency medical services provider in a publicly funded system. During a 3-year period, we evaluated the daily ratio of admissions to discharges at each hospital and the next-day median ED length of stay in the same hospital by using linear regression.', 'Across hospitals, the daily mean (SD) 50th percentile ED length of stay averaged 218 (51) minutes. As the inpatient admission-discharge ratio increased or decreased, next-day ED length of stay changed accordingly. Compared with ratios of 1.0, those less than 0.6 were associated with an 11-minute (95% confidence interval [CI] 5 to 16 minutes) shorter next-day median ED length of stay; at admission-discharge ratios of 1.3 to 1.4, ED length of stay was significantly prolonged by 5 minutes (95% CI 3 to 6 minutes). Admission-discharge ratios on weekends and among medical inpatients had a stronger influence on next-day ED length of stay; effects were also greater among higher-acuity and admitted ED patients. Answer: Disequilibrium between the number of admitted and discharged inpatients significantly affects next-day ED length of stay. Better matching of daily hospital discharges and admissions could reduce ED waiting times and may be more amenable to intervention than reducing admissions alone. The admission-discharge ratio may also provide a simple way of tracking and enhancing hospital system performance.

As a disclaimer, my husband and I enjoy a good prime rib.  We used to live in the Bay Area and frequented HOPR in SF.  Our options are limited in SD and thus we arrived at Lawry's Vegas looking forward to a nice piece of meat!  The service was just eh for the price you're paying.  Our waitress at one point came over and excused herself to \\"need to attend to something\\" before taking our order.  She then immediately went to the table across from us and chatted up the couple and their child, who sat down 10 minutes after us, for a good 15-20 minutes!!   She obviously knew them and was in no hurry to tend to us.  The one star she gets was the fact they noted it was my husbands birthday and thus brought out a comp dessert.    The food was rather mediocre as well.  The salad was rather bland and non-descript.  As per usual Lawry's style, the prime rib is served straight from the carving cart at your table.  The meat was actually a little cold - I guess that's what happens when the restaurant is more than half empty.  The flavor of the prime rib was also quite lacking.    My cut was especially tough (despite being \\"medium rare\\") - you know when you chew a piece of bad meat and just have to chew and chew and chew until your jaw is sore and then finally you can swallow?

While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Eating food, aside from Monster Meats, is always a good way to recover hunger, health, and sanity. Earlier on in the game, your main source of food will be from rabbits caught in traps, berries picked from berry bushes, and carrots lying around, all of which you can cook over a campfire and eat to restore your Hunger. However, for food that restores sanity, you'll need more thorough methods.  Carrots can be found poking out of the ground and Berry bushes are scattered around the world. You can pick them up by left-clicking or pressing X. To catch rabbits, make a trap with 6 Cut Grass and 2 Twigs. You can craft it in the Survival tab, represented by a looped rope icon. Once created, place it near or on top of a rabbit hole, which is a small hole in the ground found in grasslands and savannahs, then wait until a rabbit is caught. Once caught, the trap will rattle and jump around. If you pick it up, you’ll get both the trap and the rabbit. You can then re-use the trap for 7 more times before it disappears. You’ll need to “murder” the rabbit before you can make use of the meat, though. Right-clicking (PC) it or pressing the right direction button (PS4) when a rabbit is selected will do the trick. With a Science Machine, you can also craft a Bird Trap for 3 Twigs and 4 Silk through the Survival tab. This functions similarly to a trap, but only catches birds. To make a farm plot, you need at least a Science Machine. You can make it through the Food tab, represented by a buried carrot icon, for 8 Grass, 4 Manure, and 4 Logs. You can get Manure from Beefalo, which excrete them regularly at random intervals and are found in savannahs. You can also get Manure by feeding a pig, found individually in random spots in the map or collectively in huge villages normally found at the end of roads, with some non-meat food (berries, carrots, produce from farm plots, cave bananas, etc.). Once you’ve placed the farm plot, you can put a seed on it by selecting the seed and interacting with the farm. You can either wait for it to grow slowly throughout the day or pile manure on it until it grows. Once grown, simply interact with the crop to gather it, and congratulations! You now have some food! Jerky and Small Jerky are long-lasting food items that restore quite a bit of all three gauges. To make Jerky, you'll need to make a Drying Rack first, which is made with a Science Machine and requires 3 Rope, 3 Twigs, and 2 Charcoal.  Charcoal can be obtained by burning down Trees. You can do this by making a Torch, equipping it, then right-clicking on the Trees. Each burned Tree can be chopped down with an Axe to get 1 Charcoal. Upon creating a Drying Rack, you can then place a piece of Meat of any kind, including Frog Legs, Batilisk Wings, and Monster Meat, by approaching the rack and using the left mouse button or X to place the meat. After a few days you'll have your Jerky ready for consumption! The Crock Pot is another way of cooking your food, and you can make one with a Science Machine and costs 6 Charcoal, 6 Twigs and 3 Cut Stone. The Crock Pot's cooking mechanic requires you to put in 4 items of food in the four slots to cook and takes about a minute for the dish to cook. Most meals can restore a great amount of sanity, as long as you figure out the recipe.  You can use Twigs as fillers for recipe, which would usually save you from using up more important “edible” ingredients. Be careful when adding Monster Meats and Durians, though. Use too much without a twig, and you’ll end up with a Monster Lasagna, an incredibly damaging food that gives a hefty penalty to Health and Sanity.

From your choices, let's consider every one of them and their overall fit in the context. Choice 1: 'adds seasonings from a can and a tortilla to the pasta;' While adding seasonings from a can would certainly further enrich the flavor of the dish, the addition of a 'tortilla' seems out of place considering that the person is preparing a spaghetti dish, not a tex-mex or Mexican dish where tortillas are prevalent food items. Choice 2: 'slices lettuce while cooking them in a separate pot;' This choice again seems somewhat disjointed from the rest of the dish. While it's possible to incorporate lettuce into the sauce or salad, cooking it in a separate pot might not seem to blend well with the rest of the dish. Raw lettuce is often used in salads or as toppings, not typically cooked alongside pasta. Choice 3: 'then starts making a salad with the pomodorate stuff and dressing along with laying out a jar of dressing;' This choice fits in the context seemingly well. The pomodoro sauce (which the 'pomodorate stuff' likely refers to) is a traditional Italian tomato-based sauce, often used in pasta recipes, which matches perfectly with the prepared spaghetti. Moreover, the presence of a salad with dressing would balance out the meal, providing it with some fresh raw elements. Choice 4: 'then adds a cup of grape tomatoes;' Enriching the sauce or dish with grape tomatoes seems like a good idea, considering their tangy flavor that could complement the rest of the meal. However, the placement or use of these tomatoes is not specified. Are they added to the sauce, used in a salad, or just served as is? Considering all the options, the most logical next event in the cooking process mentioned above would be, \\"then starts making a salad with the pomodorate stuff and dressing along with laid out a jar of dressing.\\" This choice maintains the Italian theme of the meal – spaghetti with pomodoro sauce, and introduces another element to the meal - a salad. It is logical to assume that while the spaghetti is being cooked, the person preparing the meal can simultaneously whip up a salad using the dressing. The \\"jar of dressing\\" could either refer to the same Italian dressing used earlier or another type of dressing, offering variety to the person eating the meal."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

POST : During a long road trip I stopped off with my 4yo daughter for dinner at a family run rest stop type café/restaurant we’ve been to many times before. My daughter is almost 5 and a very gregarious child who talks to everyone she meets.  She also is very tall for her age so could easily be mistaken for 6 or 7 and as a result adults often expect quite a lot from her conversationally and behaviourally.   She’d been chatting away to a man on his own who was waiting for his takeaway and he while being very nice to her and polite was clearly a bit uncomfortable and kept addressing me instead of her and almost looking to me for reassurance that it was ok to talk to her.  I think he handled it really well and I was more than happy for them to be talking. A bit later we were sitting at our table and I noticed one of the waiters kept looking over and smiling at her, to begin with I was proud as she’d clearly made a bit of an impression on a few of the staff as it was quiet and she’d been pretty funny. When he brought the food over though he didn’t acknowledge me at all and said directly to her “do you know you are really beautiful?” She was looking at a game she was playing on my phone at the time and didn’t look up or respond and so he said it again.  I got her attention and said “the man is talking to you” he said it again and she just stared at him so I made her say thank you.  I was uncomfortable for a few reasons:  I didn’t like his tone or the look on his face, I’ve seen it before in my 35 years on this planet as a woman It’s one thing to compliment a child on their behaviour or something but I found his word choice “beautiful” inappropriate I made her acknowledge him and thank him for a compliment that made me uncomfortable  &amp;#x200B; Later on he came back and  brought her a slice of cake I hadn’t ordered for free and (again not acknowledging me at all) told her it’s their secret and not to tell mum.

News article: Frank, in Fight, Can't Help Fellow Democrats as Much Taunton, Mass., Mayor Charles Crowley, left, joins Bill Clinton and Barney Frank at a September campaign rally. It's the kind of political year in which even Rep. Barney Frank is being forced to break a sweat. The Massachusetts Democrat, one of Congress's most well-known members, usually wins re-election by steamrolling his opponents. This year, he's campaigning aggressively to beat back Sean Bielat, an upstart Republican challenger who was five years old when Mr. Frank first won a House seat in 1980. It remains highly unlikely Mr. Frank will lose. He remains popular in his Boston-area district. From his perch as chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, he has surpassed his own fund-raising record. Internal polls show him with a 24-point lead with less than a month left; his opponent says the gap is closer to 10. Last time, Mr. Frank won by 43 points. See which House, Senate and governors' races are considered closest. But the national mood is hostile, and conservative groups would consider his defeat a trophy for their wall. Mr. Frank is now spending more time on his re-election instead of pumping money into the campaigns of vulnerable Democratic lawmakers, the traditional role of a party grandee. As a result, Mr. Frank's focus on his own district will have reverberations in races across the country. So far this election, Mr. Frank has dipped into his personal re-election account to donate just 35,000 to 12 Democratic candidates, according to campaign-finance figures compiled by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, a fraction of his largesse two years ago, when he gave 248,000 to 86 candidates. This year, he has given 250,000 to the campaign arm of House Democrats, compared with 650,000 in 2008. Jerry Seib and Aaron Zitner look at the Senate races in Washington, California and Connecticut in which Democrats are starting to gain momentum. Mr. Frank's opponent is a 35-year-old U.S. Marine Reserve officer and a business consultant from the Boston suburb of Brookline. His campaign has been focused on jump-starting the economy, taking on the political establishment in Washington and removing regulations he says hurt growth. \\"People here are tired of Barney Frank,\\" said Mr. Bielat. \\"He's been here for 30 years. He's gained a reputation for being arrogant to constituents, to the press, to whomever.\\" Mr. Bielat shocked many by raising 400,000 in September, a large number for a neophyte, and he said money has poured in this month as well. Last month, Mr. Frank, 70, drafted former President Bill Clinton to appear at a campaign event in Taunton, a sign of how seriously Mr. Frank takes the race. As one of the chief authors of the new Wall Street regulatory law, Mr. Frank has became a target of business and conservative groups who dislike the legislation. Mr. Frank said many of the attacks on his record, particularly related to housing policy and the growth of mortgage-finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, were inaccurate. \\"It's not my opponent that is the issue, it's the right-wing attacks,\\" Mr. Frank said. \\"No matter how implausible things are, if people are saying them over and over again, you've got to respond to them or people will believe them.\\" New England is hostile territory for House Republicans, and the 2008 election wiped the party off the map. Massachusetts seemed particularly impenetrable until January, when Republican Scott Brown won the Senate seat previously held by Sen. Edward Kennedy. Mr. Brown won Mr. Frank's district easily, suggesting to some that Mr. Frank's seat could be in play. Some Republicans believe they have a shot to win three House seats in Massachusetts alone, including Mr. Frank's. Mr. Frank's district includes a large section of blue-collar neighborhoods that make up southeastern Massachusetts. It winds north through the state and includes parts of Boston suburbs Newton and Brookline. Mr. Frank has more than 1 million on hand to finish the race, and the support of many local business groups. With just four weeks until election day, it's now looking like the Republicans have a chance of regaining control of the U.S. Senate. Senator John Cornyn, National Republican Senatorial Committee Chairman joins Jerry Seib to discuss GOP prospects. \\"It's much more of a race than it has been in prior years, but from our perspective, it would be a real loss to Massachusetts if Barney's not re-elected,\\" said Daniel Forte, president of the Massachusetts Bankers Association, a trade group. Messrs. Frank and Bielat are scheduled to debate each other twice. \\"When turnout is low, a 10% differential in a poll can evaporate quickly,\\" said Roger Porter, a professor at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government. \\"While Frank clearly has the lead now, and he's very well funded and financed, he will undoubtedly put on a huge get-out-the vote effort, but so will his challenger.\\" Write to Damian Paletta at damian.paletta@wsj.com and Brody Mullins at brody.mullins@wsj.com What are the most important parts of this news article?","output":"The most important parts of this news article are: 1. Rep. Barney Frank, a prominent Massachusetts Democrat, is facing an unexpectedly competitive re-election campaign against Republican challenger Sean Bielat. 2. Frank's focus on his own re-election is limiting his ability to support other vulnerable Democratic candidates in close races across the country. 3. Bielat, a U.S. Marine Reserve officer and business consultant, has gained traction with his focus on jump-starting the economy and challenging the political establishment in Washington. 4. Frank has had to bring in political heavyweights, like former President Bill Clinton, to bolster his campaign. 5. Republican Scott Brown's Senate victory in Massachusetts earlier in the year has given hope to Republicans that Frank's seat could be up for grabs. 6.

While it is important to use good quality equipment, it doesn't necessarily need to be new. As long as the equipment is in proper working condition and calibrated accurately, it should suffice. 3. Results of the investigation must be recorded accurately. This seems crucial. Accurate recording of results ensures transparency and reproducibility of the experiment. Other scientists can rely on the findings if they know the results are reported with precision. 4. The investigation needs to be performed by well-known scientists. The identity of the scientists is not important, as long as proper scientific methods and protocols are followed.

News article: China Launches a Robocop Security Robot Called the AnBot China has unveiled a robotic crime fighter known as the AnBot. Developed by the National Defense University, this 1.49-m, 78-kg droid patrols at a leisurely 1 km/h (albeit with a touted top speed of 18 km/h) and “will play an important role in enhancing the country’s anti-terrorism and anti-riot measures,” the state mouthpiece People’s Daily reported Tuesday.

There are different types of fades, such as low, mid, or high fades, depending on the starting point of the shorter hair. - Undercut: An undercut consists of long hair on top while the sides and back are shaved or cut very short. The contrast between the top and sides is more apparent than in a fade, as there is a more noticeable disconnection between the lengths.

Context: I’ve learnt a great amount throughout this studio, first and foremost I was taught: how the art world functions, how specific galleries such as Gertrude St Contemporary run and how artists earn a living. The studio also provided me with basic filmmaking skills such as how to: create a shooting schedule, write a shooting script, set up three-point lighting, conduct an interview, utilise visual storytelling and edit a short film. Throughout the shooting process with my artist I also developed my abilities regarding how to use a: Sony Zoom H2N (and other such handy recorders), a lapel mic, my own Canon EOS 60D and Adobe Premiere Pro editing software. Overall I think the studio functioned quite successfully, it was great to be in a studio with nineteen people who all were interested in the same topics as you. I felt that overall, the studios had a very happy and supportive environment, and you walked away knowing a great deal about the art world and how to make short documentaries. The project itself taught me a great deal about how to work with talent, as well as my group members. Having to work independently forced me to be completely all over every aspect of the shoot, whether that be choosing which questions to ask, deciding what to focus on, where I wanted the shoot to happen, deciding what gear to use, getting to the shoot, carrying all the gear, what I wanted to shoot, managing the audio, managing the lighting, managing the camera set-ups, managing the talent, editing the film, and finding a great soundtrack for it. I’m a pretty self-conscious person and I often doubt the decisions I make or ask someone else for their opinion (should I shoot this angle, or what do you think of this question etc.). Working independently pushed me to go with my gut instincts, to make decisions and to not seek others approval. It forced me to develop my aesthetic as a filmmaker and to own the work that I ended up producing, so ultimately I was really glad with how everything panned out.

Which friend read more about the mycelia of the fungi increasing the surface area of the plant’s root system?  Hint: A mycorrhiza (Greek for \\"fungus roots\\") is a symbiotic association between a fungus and the roots of a plant. In a mycorrhizal association, the fungus may colonize the roots of a host plant by either growing directly into the root cells, or by growing around the root cells. This association provides the fungus with relatively constant and direct access to glucose, which the plant produces by photosynthesis. The mycelia of the fungi increase the surface area of the plant’s root system.

Rob is studying medicine in a prestigious university. Today, his professor is teaching about blood glucose levels. He gave example of two patients, patient A and patient B. Patient A had high blood glucose level, but patient B had low blood glucose level. Rob was amazed to find how body keeps its balance.  Hint: Another example of negative feedback has to do with blood glucose levels. When glucose (sugar) levels in the blood are too high, the pancreas secretes insulin to stimulate the absorption of glucose and the conversion of glucose into glycogen, which is stored in the liver. As blood glucose levels decrease, less insulin is produced. When glucose levels are too low, another hormone called glucagon is produced, which causes the liver to convert glycogen back to glucose. A:","output":"Patient B is more likely to produce the hormone glucagon. Step 1: Identify the role of glucagon In the paragraph, it is mentioned that when glucose levels are too low, a hormone called glucagon is produced. Glucagon causes the liver to convert glycogen back to glucose. Step 2: Compare the glucose levels of patient A and patient B Patient A has high blood glucose levels, while patient B has low blood glucose levels.

Article: Why can some people sleep through noises like a honking car or flushing toilet, while others are awakened by the lightest sound? To find the answer, sleep researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital conducted an unusual study of 12 self-described deep sleepers. After tests confirmed that the healthy volunteers were solid sleepers, they took part in a three-night study in the university's sleep laboratory. The participants spent the night in a big and comfortable room. But the room also included four speakers positioned near the top of the bed. During the night, the deep sleepers were subjected to 14 different recorded sounds, like street traffic, toilets flushing, an ice machine dispensing and an airplane flying overhead. Next door, the researchers monitored their sleep patterns and brain waves. As expected, all of the participants slept  ly well, but there were differences in how they responded to the noisy interruptions. Some of the sleepers didn't wake up even when a sound was blasted at 70 decibels  ; others were awakened by sounds at 40 or 50 decibels. The researchers discovered that the difference in a sleeper's reaction to noise could be predicted by the level of brain activity called \\"sleep spindles''. A sleep spindle is a burst of high-frequency brain activity coming from deep inside the brain during sleep. The source of the spindles is the thalamus, a part of the brain that sends sensory information to the rest of the cortex  . Before the study, the Massachusetts researchers theorized   that the spindles are the brain's way of preventing sensory information from passing through the thalamus and waking the rest of the brain during sleep. They found that the sleepers who experienced the most sleep spindles during the night were also the soundest sleepers and were least likely to be awakened by noise. Scientists already know that most people become lighter sleepers with age, most likely because older people experience less \\"slow wave sleep'', which is the deepest stage of sleep. People also produce...

Lucas Black as Caleb Temple and Gary Cole as Sheriff Lucas Buck are great together, even though they are somewhat rivals. Almost representing good (Caleb) and evil (Sherriff Lucas Buck). I never really understood exactly what Lucas was supposed to be, but let it suffice to say, he has some special powers that I don't believe were granted by anything Holy. He can make phones ring, writing appear, or even cause a person's emotions to change. None the less, there are a few episodes where he actually becomes the good guy in spite of it all. All in all, this is an excellent series that like so many others I can think of, (I.E.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What does Beyoncé introduce by name as the song opens?  \\"Déjà Vu\\" is a contemporary R&B song, performed in a moderate hip hop groove. It is also influenced by late-1970s funk music, and it contains elements of soul music as well as dance-pop music. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by EMI Music Publishing, the song is composed in the key of G minor with a time signature in common time, and a moderate groove of 106 beats per minute. Beyoncé's vocals range from the note of D♯4 to F5. The music is largely based on live instrumentation, including a bass guitar, conga, hi-hat, and horns. A non-live instrument, the Roland TR-808 drum machine, provides the song's heavy and energetic disco beat. Spence D. of IGN Music commented that Beyoncé's vocals on the song are \\"silky smooth\\" and that her vocal range leans toward the high end, hence contrasting to the song's low-end construction. Mike Joseph of PopMatters noted that \\"Déjà Vu\\" is reminiscent of Michael Jackson's \\"Off the Wall\\" (1980). The title refers to the déjà vu phenomenon. The lyrics to \\"Déjà Vu\\" follow the verse–pre-chorus–chorus pattern, and feature two rap verses. It is hook-laden, similar in this respect to \\"Crazy in Love\\". The lyrics detail a woman being constantly reminded of a past lover, shown in the lines, \\"Is it because I'm missing you that I'm having déjà vu?\\" As the song opens, Beyoncé introduces the bass, hi-hat and Roland TR-808 by name. The sounds of the instruments blend as they are being mentioned one after the other; the horns are only audible in the pre-chorus and hook sections, and a short section in the second rap. The bass guitar, which is the first instrument to enter, slides into the main two-bar ostinato. Following the repeated bass slides, the hi-hat and the Roland TR-808 begin playing.After that Beyoncé mentions Jay-Z, the bass glides up for a vibrato-rich fill, giving way to the first rap. Backgrounded with a repeating groove, Beyoncé starts the first verse. The pre-chorus follows, for which the bass changes to a more melodic tone \\"to play something more singing\\",...

Article: \\"Congratulations, Mr. Jones, it's a girl.\\" Fatherhood is going to have a different meaning and bring forth a different answer from every man who hears these words. Some feel proud when they receive the news, while others worry, wondering whether they will be good fathers. Although there are some men who like children and may have had considerable experience with them, others do not particularly care for children and spend little time with them. Many fathers and mothers have been planning and looking forward to children for some time. For other couples, pregnancy  was an accident that both husband and wife have accepted willingly or unwillingly. Whatever the reaction to the birth of a child, it is obvious that the change from the role of husband to that of father is a difficult task. Yet, unfortunately, few attempts have been made to educate fathers in this re-socialization process. Although many good books have been written about American mothers, only recently have some books discussed the role of a father. It is argued by some writers that the transition to the father's role, although difficult, is not nearly as great as the transition the wife must make to the mother's role. The mother's role seems to require a complete transformation of daily routine and adaptation to a new life, on the other hand, the father's role is less demanding and immediate. However, even though we have mentioned the fact that growing numbers of women are working outside the home, the father is still thought by many as the breadwinner in the household.

Mauricio Pochettino praises Federico Fazio and Benji Stambouli who made their first starts for the club.","output":"Title: Tottenham Held to Stalemate in Partizan Clash; Injuries and New Starters Mark the Game The eminent Premier League club, Tottenham Hotspur, faced a major blow when their key player, Andros Townsend, was forced to exit the field due to an upper leg injury during their hard-won encounter against Partizan Belgrade. For the Spurs, their night in Belgrade ended in a goalless deadlock, as they were unable to land even a single shot on target in the eventful 0-0 draw. Andros Townsend, the influential winger and sometimes striker for Tottenham, saw a premature end to his evening on the pitch as an upper leg injury compelled his substitution. This was undoubtedly a setback for the Spurs who already had an uphill battle ahead of them. Townsend's injury risked not only the team's offensive force but also presented a significant dilemma for the management considering the crucial fixtures that lie ahead. Tottenham's prowess was drastically curtailed as they failed to register a shot on target in the crucial fixture. Despite being known for their attacking style and ability to reroute their opponent's defense, the Spurs seemed perplexed and mildly disorganized. Their attempts at asserting dominance through their trademark aggressive play didn't materialize, leading to the goalless draw. Despite the injuries and the inability to penetrate Partizan's solid defense, there was still something that Tottenham's Head Coach, Mauricio Pochettino, found to be commendable. He reserved a word of praise for Federico Fazio and Benji Stambouli, who donned the club's colours for the first time in a starting role.  Both Fazio and Stambouli displayed commendable poise and determination in their debut. Fazio, an imposing force in the centre-back role, and Stambouli, operating from deep midfield, provided a sense of solidity and showcased their potential to be consistent contributors in the upcoming games. This might have been a tough expedition for Tottenham, but it's clear that Pochettino sees glimmers of hope. With new players finding their way and the spark that comes from a fresh start, the club has much to look forward to this season. Despite this stumbling block, the club remains resolute and is ready to strive harder for the next encounter. In the wake of the draw and the forced substitution due to an injury, the club must now refocus its resources and strategy. Pochettino's post-match remarks seem promising, indicating that Tottenham will capitalize on this learning experience in future games."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

For a while, as the AP reported, her whereabouts were unknown; she ended up checking into a different California facility late yesterday, TMZ reports. Apparently Lohan spent just a few minutes at Morningside Recovery in Newport Beach, which was already a last-minute switcheroo from the New York facility she originally chose. Morningside had not been approved by prosecutors and it's not licensed for residential in-patient rehab—a problem since Lohan was supposed to be at a lockdown facility. Lohan \\"was not happy with the place,\\" dad Michael says of Morningside, according to CNN. \\"Lindsay had no idea that Morningside wasn't approved.\\" So she ended up at Betty Ford, hours before prosecutors were set to seek an arrest warrant. (The Rancho Mirage facility is the same one where Lohan was accused of brawling with a staffer in 2010.) She also re-hired her old attorney, Shawn Holley, who negotiated the Betty Ford deal for her with the Santa Monica city attorney; now the judge just needs to sign off on it, which he is expected to do. Bizarrely, the New York Daily News spotted her wandering around an electronics store yesterday; that paper says she wanted to fly back to New York, and according to the quotes it got from Michael Lohan, Lindsay really has no grasp of the way the legal system works: \\"She said, 'Daddy, how can they arrest me?'\\" says Michael, who convinced her to stay in LA.","output":"**Title: Lindsay Lohan's Rehab Drama: A Tale of Switched Facilities and Uncertainty** Lindsay Lohan's attorney informed a judge yesterday that the actress was safely \\"ensconced in the bosom\\" of a California rehab facility, but it turned out that she never actually checked in. As reported by the Associated Press, for some time, her whereabouts remained unknown. However, TMZ confirms that Lohan finally checked into a different California facility late yesterday. This latest development comes after Lohan spent merely a few minutes at Morningside Recovery in Newport Beach, which was already an eleventh-hour change from her original choice of a New York facility. Unfortunately for Lohan, Morningside had not been approved by prosecutors and was not licensed for residential in-patient rehab. This posed a significant issue, as Lohan was required to be at a lockdown facility. Lindsay's father, Michael Lohan, told CNN that she \\"was not happy with the place\\" and had no idea that Morningside wasn't approved. As a result, Lindsay decided to check into the Betty Ford Center, just hours before prosecutors planned to seek an arrest warrant. It is worth noting that the Rancho Mirage facility was the same one where Lohan was accused of getting into a brawl with a staff member back in 2010. Adding another twist to the story, Lindsay re-hired her previous attorney, Shawn Holley, who promptly negotiated the Betty Ford deal on her behalf with the Santa Monica city attorney. Now, all that remains is for the judge to sign off on the arrangement, which is expected to happen shortly. In a bizarre turn of events, the New York Daily News spotted the troubled actress wandering through an electronics store yesterday, and reported that she wished to fly back to her home state of New York. According to statements given by Michael Lohan to the newspaper, Lindsay seemed to have little understanding of the legal system, quoting her as saying, \\"Daddy, how can they arrest me?\\" Michael ultimately persuaded her to remain in Los Angeles to deal with the matter at hand. This ordeal has certainly brought a lot of attention to Lohan's ongoing struggles, but the hope is that the decision to enter the Betty Ford Center will provide her with the necessary support and guidance during this tumultuous time."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

The Cromwellian conquest completed the British colonisation of Ireland, which was merged into the Commonwealth of England, Scotland and Ireland in 1653-59. It destroyed the native Irish Catholic land-owning classes and replaced them with colonists with a British identity. The bitterness caused by the Cromwellian settlement was a powerful source of Irish nationalism from the 17th century onwards. After the Stuart Restoration in 1660, Charles II of England restored about a third of the confiscated land to the former landlords in the Act of Settlement 1662, but not all, as he needed political support from former parliamentarians in England. A generation later, during the Glorious Revolution, many of the Irish Catholic landed class tried to reverse the remaining Cromwellian settlement in the Williamite War in Ireland , where they fought en masse for the Jacobites. They were defeated once again, and many lost land that had been regranted after 1662. As a result, Irish and English Catholics did not become full political citizens of the British state again until 1829 and were legally barred from buying valuable interests in land until the Papists Act 1778.

Given the question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Scientists Alan M.Goldberg and Thomas Hartung describe recent advances in replacing the use of animals in toxicology testing.Improvements in cell and tissue culture technologies,for example,allow a growing number of tests to be performed on human cells alone.Computer models are becoming increasingly complex and many could one day become more accurate than trials in living animals. Since the late 1990s,Huntingdon Life Sciences--a company that conducts testing of substances on animals conducted by the Environmental Protection Agency and the Food and Drug Administration--has become a proving ground for aggressive strategies by animal-rights militants  .At a hearing,a Senate.committee listened to testimony  against Huntingdon employees and financial institutions providing services to the company.One experimentation witness at the hearing insisted that any means necessary were justified  to spare animals' lives;he has previously accepted the idea of murder to that end. Use of animals in testing and in biomedical research continues to be necessary in many instances and is ethically preferable to experimenting on humans or giving up cures that could save human lives.But for the sake of people and animals alike,the development and acceptance of animal substitutes deserve enthusiastic support. In some instances, substitutes are already thought as good or better than animals,but supervising agencies have yet to catch up.In both the European Union and the U.S.,scientists and companies wanting to use the new alternative tests complain that regulatory standards for proving a drug or chemical to be safe for humans force the continued use of animals.Thus,animal-loving Americans might turn to persuading the EPA and the FDA to speed validation of new methods so that they can be more widely employed.And animal advocates  who want to influence business could consider investing in the small biotech's and large pharmaceutical  companies that are working to develop alternatives to animals in research. The answer is:","output":"A. Which of the following is NOT one of the recent advances in replacing the use of animals in toxicology testing as described by scientists Alan M.Goldberg and Thomas Hartung? a) Improvements in cell and tissue culture technologies allowing tests to be performed on human cells alone. b) The use of computer models that are becoming increasingly complex and potentially more accurate than trials in living animals. c) The use of live human subjects to directly test the effects of various substances. d) Regulatory standard adjustments that allow substitutes for animal testing to be employed more widely. The correct choice in this context is (c). The article does not mention the use of live human subjects as a recent advance in replacing animals for toxicology testing. The article advocates for using human cells and sophisticated computer models as alternatives to animal testing, and also mentions the need for regulatory standards to be revised so that these alternatives can be employed more widely. This question effectively tests comprehension and understanding of the key points in the article, ensuring that the reader understands the proposed alternatives to animal testing as well as the challenges posed by existing regulatory standards. The distractor (c) is plausible and relevant to the topic, but it is not mentioned in the text, making it the correct answer choice."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Little did she know that this decision would lead to an unforgettable journey that would transform her life in ways she had never anticipated. Patricia had heard about the island from a mutual friend who had visited Natalie on her travels.

Natalie knew the ins and outs of the island's customs and practices and was more than happy to help Patricia acclimate to her new surroundings. She took Patricia under her wing and introduced her to the locals and various points of interest on the island. In no time, Patricia began embracing her new way of life.

From learning about the indigenous species that inhabited the land and water, to partaking in age-old cultural traditions, Patricia was an eager and enthusiastic learner. She even began to pick up the local language, and this further endeared her to the people of the island.

Although the reviewer acknowledged that the staff and people giving the shots were friendly and it is evident that they had their pet's shots done at this place, several negative aspects of the experience were pointed out. First, the review highlights the poor environment by describing the store as filthy and noisy. The noise level, according to the reviewer, was caused by a dog get-together event happening at the front of the store, leading to continuous barking. This exacerbated the negative experience since dogs, puppies, and cats, including the reviewer's own cat, were present in the area waiting to receive their shots. The cat's terrified state due to the barking was mentioned as a specific negative aspect of the experience. Furthermore, the dirty state of the floors led to dissatisfaction as the reviewer felt their dog was sitting in dirt throughout their time at the store. This could imply a lack of proper cleanliness and sanitation in the establishment, which can be a crucial factor in deciding whether or not to visit a store or clinic for pet-related services. The concluding statement indicates that the reviewer is unlikely to return to this place unless it's absolutely necessary to get shots for their pets again. This suggests that the negative aspects of the experience outweighed the friendly service provided by the staff and the people administering the shots. Overall, this review leans more towards the negative side and paints an unfavorable picture of the establishment in question."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the first name of the person in the passage who died?, using the article: \\"Imagine\\" is a song co-written and performed by English musician John Lennon. The best-selling single of his solo career, its lyrics encourage the listener to imagine a world at peace without the barriers of borders or the divisions of religion and nationality and to consider the possibility that the whole of humanity would live unattached to material possessions. Shortly before his death, Lennon said that much of the song's \\"lyric and content\\" came from his wife Yoko Ono, and in 2017, she received a co-writing credit.Lennon and Ono co-produced the song and album of the same name with Phil Spector. Recording began at Lennon's home studio at Tittenhurst Park, England, in May 1971, with final overdubs taking place at the Record Plant, in New York City, during July. One month after the September release of the LP, Lennon released \\"Imagine\\" as a single in the United States; the song peaked at number three on the Billboard Hot 100 and the LP reached number one on the UK chart in November, later becoming the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed album of Lennon's solo career. Although not originally released as a single in the United Kingdom, it was released in 1975 to promote Shaved Fish, a compilation LP and it reached number six on the chart that year. The photograph on the cover was taken by May Pang in 1974. The song has since sold more than 1.6 million copies in the UK; it reached number one following Lennon's murder in December 1980. In 1985, the Central Park Conservancy memorialised a portion of the park in honour of Lennon, called Strawberry Fields, with a mosaic that reads \\"Imagine\\".BMI named \\"Imagine\\" one of the 100 most-performed songs of the 20th century. The song ranked number 30 on the Recording Industry Association of America's list of the 365 Songs of the Century bearing the most historical significance.

Article: Some years ago on a hot summer day in south Florida, a little boy decided to go for a swim in the lake behind his house. He ran out of the back door, leaving behind shoes, socks and shirt as he went. He flew into the water, not realizing that as he swam toward the middle of the lake, an alligator   was getting close. The mother in the house was looking out of the window and saw the two as they got closer and closer together. In great fear, she ran toward the water, shouting to her son as loudly as she could. Hearing her voice, the little boy made a U--turn to swim to his mother. It was too late. Just as he reached her, the alligator reached him. The mother caught her little boy by the arms just as the alligator pulled his legs. That began an unbelievable tug-of-war   between _ . The alligator was much stronger than the mother, but the mother did her best not to let go. A farmer happened to drive by, heard their screams, rushed from his truck and helped them.

Natalie was shy at work while Kayla was very assertive, so","output":"Natalie often looked up to Kayla as a source of inspiration, hoping to learn from her confidence and strong communication skills. Although some people saw Kayla's assertiveness as overpowering, Natalie believed that it stemmed from a great sense of self-assurance and ability to say what needed to be said, even in challenging situations. She admired Kayla's fearlessness when it came to speaking her mind and standing up for her ideas. Natalie, on the other hand, struggled with expressing herself and often found it difficult to contribute to discussions during meetings. She worried about what others might think of her opinions, and the fear of being judged or dismissed by her peers kept her from participating as actively as she wanted to. Despite their contrasting personalities, Natalie and Kayla maintained a healthy professional relationship, finding ways to work together effectively and even complementing each other's strengths. Kayla admired Natalie's attention to detail, creative problem-solving skills, and ability to work marvelously well under pressure. Natalie's quiet dedication and diligence to her work helped counterbalance Kayla's sometimes overwhelming energy, resulting in a dynamic and efficient partnership. Observing Kayla closely, Natalie began to pick up on some of her assertive habits and strategies. She noticed that Kayla was always well-prepared; anything she thought, said, or did had a clear intention and purpose. This not only gave her an air of authority and confidence but also ensured that her ideas were backed up by strong, evidence-based arguments. Natalie realized that, for her to emulate Kayla's assertiveness, she needed to build her own confidence first. She started putting more effort into her work, double-checking her facts, and seeking constructive feedback from her colleagues to improve her performance. This practice helped Natalie grow both as an individual and as a professional, laying the groundwork for her to develop a stronger voice in the workplace. Slowly, Natalie began adopting some of the assertive communication techniques that Kayla exemplified. She practiced speaking up in meetings, ensuring she had done thorough research beforehand so she could articulate her ideas clearly and convincingly. Natalie made a conscious effort to maintain eye contact while speaking, a small but powerful tool that helped her appear more self-assured and attentive. With time and perseverance, Natalie's newfound assertiveness did not go unnoticed by her colleagues. Co-workers began to value her input and actively sought out her opinion on various matters. Natalie's diligent and thoughtful approach to her work helped her establish a newfound respect among her peers, which in turn bolstered her self-confidence. As Natalie grew more comfortable expressing herself assertively, her relationship with Kayla evolved as well. What began as a mentor-mentee dynamic transformed into a more collaborative, balanced partnership. Together, they tackled projects with renewed enthusiasm, leveraging their strengths to innovate and drive their team towards success. In the end, Natalie's journey to becoming more assertive proved not only transformative for her career but for her personal life as well.

Context: I think that one of the people who caused me the most misery for the longest was someone that I’ll call “Luna”. So, most people have probably met that person that acts all suicidal and then uses that against you. For example, you’re talking to someone like that and you’re having some sort of argument and the moment they realize they aren’t winning they send you pictures of their bloodied wrists and say “This is your fault”. Well, that person was my friend for a long time. Every time I would try to leave her to go to sleep she would threaten to do “something bad” and I knew what she meant, and me, first meeting her when I was around 9 or 10, and I was still extremely naive. So most of the time, I ended up staying awake til 3 AM on school nights and I would get only a few hours of sleep, and she’d be happy because her life wasn’t worsened at all. But I think the thing that made me the most miserable, was the fact that it never got better. No matter how much I talked to her, or how sympathetic I tried to be, or how much I tried to convince her to be happier, it never got better. She still acted super depressed, but like it was a joke. All of these things combined to make me completely miserable because it seemed like it was all for nothing. But I just let it happen, because she was the only person I had and she was really my only “friend” at that point, and all the way up to seventh grade. So for that entire period of time, she certainly wasn’t the only source of misery for me, but she made me feel way worse than I would have if I hadn’t been friends with her.

Professor Hinkle","output":"Title: The Enchanted Classroom Genre: Adventure, Fantasy, Family Plot Summary: A talented, but down on his luck magician named Professor Hinkle gets hired by a teacher named Miss Evans to entertain her students and bring some magic to their ordinary school lives. The professor ends up finding a peculiar ancient artifact in the school's old storage, which upon recitation of a mysterious incantation, turns the classroom into an enchanted wonderland. The children, teacher, and Professor Hinkle then embark on a quest to navigate this otherworldly realm, uncover the story behind the artifact, and find their way back home. Act 1: Introducing the Characters The movie opens with an aerial shot of Northbrook Middle School, located in a quiet suburban town. We are introduced to Miss Evans, a passionate and dedicated teacher, who struggles to make her lessons exciting enough to engage her students. She has the idea of inviting a magician, Professor Hinkle, to entertain her disinterested students. Professor Hinkle, a middle-aged man with a wiry beard and twinkling eyes, is a seasoned magician who has always dreamed of performing in grand theaters and enchanting his audience with extraordinary acts of illusion. However, he now finds himself performing at children's parties and other small events, due to dwindling demand for his art. Act 2: The Discovery of the Artifact On the day of Professor Hinkle's performance in Miss Evans’ classroom, he accidentally stumbles upon an old box in the school's dusty storage room. Inside the box, he finds a peculiar artifact with a set of cryptic instructions, which he decides to use in his act. Back in the classroom, Professor Hinkle starts performing simple acts of magic that amaze and delight the students. As they become more interested, he decides to incorporate the artifact into his act by reciting the mysterious incantation inscribed upon it. To the surprise of everyone in the classroom, reciting the incantation transforms their ordinary schoolroom into an enchanted wonderland. The now bewildered students, Miss Evans, and Professor Hinkle suddenly find themselves transported to a magical realm filled with vivid landscapes and mythical creatures. Act 3: The Quest The group, now realizing they are trapped in this magical world, sets off on a journey to find a way back to their reality. Along the way, they encounter and befriend various inhabitants, such as talking animals, friendly giants, and cheerful fairies. The group learns that the artifact holds a deeper meaning and has a long history in the magical realm, having been lost for centuries. With the help of their newfound friends, the group undertakes challenges and puzzles, each one revealing more information about the artifact and its origin. They eventually discover the artifact's true purpose: to bring magic, wonder, and curiosity back into people's lives. Unbeknownst to Professor Hinkle, the artifact had chosen him, recognizing his pure heart and desire to create magical moments for his audience. Act 4: The Return and Resolution Once they've unraveled the mystery and embraced the essence of true magic within themselves, the group is guided by the talking animals to an ancient portal that allows them to return to their classroom. Upon their return, the now enchanted children bring newfound excitement and curiosity to their studies, inspired by the magic and wonder they experienced in the other realm. Having experienced the grandest adventure of his life, Professor Hinkle realizes that true magic exists not only in the extraordinary but also in the everyday moments that touch people's hearts. With a renewed sense of purpose, he continues to perform for children, enriching their lives with the essence of wonder and creativity. The movie ends with a heartwarming scene of Miss Evans, her enthusiastic students, and Professor Hinkle sharing a magical lesson together in the classroom, proving that the power of magic, imagination, and curiosity can truly transform the world around us."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose High caloric meats and happens, how will it affect LESS food being digested.  Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","output":"The perturbation hypothesis supposes that if a person consumes high caloric meats, it would result in less food being digested. This hypothesis is based on the assumption that the high caloric intake from the meats would provide sufficient energy, and thus decrease the need to consume more food. Let's analyze its potential direct and indirect effects on the digestion process. Direct effects: 1. If less food is consumed due to high caloric meats, there will be a smaller volume of food going through the digestive process. 2. This smaller volume of food means that the stomach will have to secrete less acid and enzymes to break down the food. 3. The smaller volume of food may pass more quickly through the small intestine and colon due to the reduced need for breaking down and absorbing nutrients. Indirect effects: 1. Consuming high caloric meats might affect the body's metabolism and energy requirements, which could influence the digestive process. 2. A diet that is rich in high caloric meats might be lacking in essential nutrients, like fiber, which is crucial for healthy digestion. The absence of sufficient fiber can lead to constipation or other digestive issues. 3. High caloric meats are also typically high in fat content. Some individuals may have difficulty digesting and absorbing high amounts of fat, potentially leading to malabsorption, diarrhea, or other digestive symptoms. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis may lead to changes in the digestive process, including a smaller volume of food being digested, less secretion of acids and enzymes, and altered passage of food through the digestive system. However, it is essential to consider that the body's overall nutritional needs and individual differences in metabolism and digestive function can also play a role."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The legs unfolded easily and the secure click once open is a great thing. No wobble, very stable.

Do Americans associate old age with telltale physical signs like wrinkles and crow’s feet? Or do they believe that passing a certain age defines a person as ‘over the hill’? According to a new study, neither  – a person is defined by how old they act, and how independent they are. For instance, consumers who can no longer shop for themselves, complete housework, or drive their cars are considered ‘old,’ the study claims. Independence is an important marker of age and strongly related to a person's 'ability to drive, shop, and cook for themselves' According to the new study by Oregon State University researcher Michelle Barnhart, activities that define one’s independence are the most important markers of age. In much of America, a person’s independence is closely tied to their ability to drive, shop, and cook for themselves. Because of these unwritten adages, those who are too feeble to carry shopping bags or operate their vehicle are looked at as someone in their twilight years. To conduct her research, Ms Barnhart conducted in-depth interviews with consumers in their late 80s, as well as their caregivers and family members – often the subject’s adult children in their 50s and 60s. Michell Barnhart of Oregon State University. Her new study looks into how perceptions of aging are changing. She found that the Baby Boomers, who are aging themselves, did not wish to be seen as old, but often treated their own parents as ‘old people’ – not allowing them to exercise independence where they could and assuming they’re scatterbrained as well as slow. Because of this, she writes that conflicts are ripe to occur between the parents, who don’t see themselves as old, and their adult children, who do. Ms Barnhart notes that those in their 80s and 90s are often dealing with negative connotations of old age. ‘Almost every stereotype we associate with being elderly is something negative,’ she said, ‘from being “crotchety” and unwilling to change to being forgetful.’ One woman she interviewed, ‘Abbie,’ is 89. When her adult daughters drove her to a routine doctor’s appointment and accompanied her into the exam room, the doctor addressed her daughters and wouldn’t talk to Abbie. Ms Barnhart claims that society tends to marginalize those who are advanced in years, rather than valuing them for their wisdom. At later appointments, Abbie told her daughters to remain in the waiting room while she was meeting with her physician. Ms Barnhart writes that part of the problem with ‘old age’ is that society tends to marginalize those who are advanced in years, rather than valuing them for their wisdom. ‘Unless we change the way we view old age, the generation younger than the boomers will treat them the same way as soon as they show a few more wrinkles, or seem a bit shaky on their feet,’ she said. Her full study will be published in the April 2013 edition of the Journal of Consumer Research.","output":"This article talks about a study by Oregon State University researcher Michelle Barnhart. She found out that being \\"old\\" is not just about having wrinkles or being a certain age, but it's about how independent someone is. Being able to drive, shop, and cook for themselves is very important for a person's independence. Sometimes, younger people make older people feel like they can't do these things anymore and treat them like they are old and forgetful. This can cause conflicts between parents and children. The study suggests that society should value older people for their wisdom, and not just see them as old because they have a few wrinkles or can't move as quickly."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Begin by organizing a collection of different socks on your kitchen counter. 2. Line up your favorite novels from tallest to shortest alongside the socks. 3. Then, place a full watering can at the end of the row of novels. 4. Carefully, balance a spoon of sugar on the edge of the tallest novel. 5. Start pouring the water from the watering can onto the first sock in line, allowing the water to flow across the length of the row of socks and novels. 6. Simultaneously, let the sugar from the spoon fall into the waterfall created by the overflowing water. 7. Using a fishing net, try to catch the sprinkles of sugar as they interact with the water cascading over the objects. 8. Finally, attempt to transfer the sugar-coated droplets of water caught in the fishing net into the pasta sauce. Although this elaborate method is closely related to the task of flavoring pasta sauce by using objects and terms like sugar, pouring, and water, it undoubtedly will not lead to the desired outcome of a well-seasoned pasta sauce."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

According to the committee head, votes will be tallied in the various polling locales by a judge and in the presence of representatives of the candidates. Each final count will be announced aloud, then an official report will be filed that can be viewed by nonprofit groups, the media, and candidates, said Sultan. As the counting progressed and the election results became apparent, it was clear that this was a closely contested race between two leading candidates. The results were widely accepted as credible and transparent, with both domestic and international observers expressing satisfaction with the electoral process. In his post-election speech, Sultan praised the millions of Egyptians who braved long lines and hot temperatures to cast their ballots, saying their participation marked a milestone in the nation's journey towards democracy. The winning candidate echoed this sentiment, pledging to address the pressing issues facing the country, such as unemployment, poverty, and inequality. However, the losing candidate's supporters took to the streets to voice their dissatisfaction with the results, demanding a recount. The government called for calm and assured the public that the electoral process had been fair and transparent, with all legal avenues open for the losing candidate to contest the results. In the following days, the situation remained tense but largely peaceful, as various political factions and civil society groups debated the election outcome. Ultimately, the losing candidate accepted the results and congratulated the winner, promising to work together for the betterment of the country. The international community welcomed the peaceful conclusion of the elections and called on the new government to address the country's myriad challenges, including strengthening democratic institutions and promoting social cohesion. The successful conduct of the presidential election marked an important step on Egypt's path towards a more open and inclusive political system."},{"instruction":"Q:If you're typing for a long time, what's a sign you should take a break?

John Kenneth Galbraith  (October 15, 1908 - April 29, 2006), also known as Ken Galbraith, was a Canadian-born economist, public official, and diplomat, and a leading proponent of 20th-century American liberalism. His books on economic topics were bestsellers from the 1950s through the 2000s, during which time Galbraith fulfilled the role of public intellectual. As an economist, he leaned toward post-Keynesian economics from an institutionalist perspective. Galbraith was a long-time Harvard faculty member and stayed with Harvard University for half a century as a professor of economics. In February 1946, Galbraith took a leave of absence from his magazine work for a senior position in the State Department as director of the Office of Economic Security Policy where he was nominally in charge of economic affairs regarding Germany, Japan, Austria, and South Korea. He was distrusted by the senior diplomats so he was relegated to routine work with few opportunities to make policy. Galbraith favored detente with the Soviet Union, along with Secretary of State James F. Byrnes and General Lucius D. Clay, a military governor of the US Zone in Germany from 1947 to 1949, but they were out of step with the containment policy then being developed by George Kennan and favored by the majority of the US major policymakers. After a disconcerting half-year, Galbraith resigned in September 1946 and went back to his magazine writing on economics issues. Later, he immortalized his frustration with \\"the ways of Foggy Bottom\\" in a satirical novel, The Triumph (1968). The postwar period also was memorable for Galbraith because of his work, along with Eleanor Roosevelt and Hubert Humphrey, to establish a progressive policy organization Americans for Democratic Action (ADA) in support of the cause of economic and social justice in 1947.  During his time as an adviser to President John F. Kennedy, Galbraith was appointed United States Ambassador to India from 1961 to 1963. His rapport with President Kennedy was such that he regularly bypassed the State Department and sent his diplomatic cables directly to the president. In India, he became a confidant of Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru and extensively advised the Indian government on economic matters. In 1966, when he was no longer ambassador, he told the United States Senate that one of the main causes of the 1965 Kashmir war was American military aid to Pakistan.  While in India, he helped establish one of the first computer science departments, at the Indian Institute of Technology in Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh. Even after leaving office, Galbraith remained a friend and supporter of India. Because of his recommendation, First Lady of the United States Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy undertook her 1962 diplomatic missions in India and Pakistan.  In autumn 1972 Galbraith was an adviser and assistant to Nixon's rival candidate George McGovern in the election campaign for the American presidency. During this time (September 1972) he travelled in to China in his role as president of the American Economic Association (AEA) at the invitation of Mao Zedong's communist government with the economists Leontief and Tobin and in 1973 published an account of his experiences in A China Passage. Galbraith wrote that there was \\"no serious doubt that China is devising a highly effective economic system,\\" \\"[d]issidents are brought firmly into line in China, but, one suspects, with great politeness,\\" \\"Greater Shanghai ... has a better medical service than New York,\\" and considered it not implausible that Chinese industrial and agricultural output was expanding annually at a rate of 10 to 11%.

Please answer the following question: Question: \\"What did the Folies Bergere have that Olympia Paris didn't?\\"  Context: \\"The music hall and cabaret are famous Paris institutions. The Moulin Rouge was opened in 1889. It was highly visible because of its large red imitation windmill on its roof, and became the birthplace of the dance known as the French Cancan. It helped make famous the singers Mistinguett and Édith Piaf and the painter Toulouse-Lautrec, who made posters for the venue. In 1911, the dance hall Olympia Paris invented the grand staircase as a settling for its shows, competing with its great rival, the Folies Bergère, Its stars in the 1920s included the American singer and dancer Josephine Baker. The Casino de Paris presented many famous French singers, including Mistinguett, Maurice Chevalier, and Tino Rossi. Other famous Paris music halls include Le Lido, on the Champs-Élysées, opened in 1946; and the Crazy Horse Saloon, featuring strip-tease, dance and magic, opened in 1951. The Olympia Paris has presented Edith Piaf, Marlene Dietrich, Miles Davis, Judy Garland, and the Grateful Dead. A half dozen music halls exist today in Paris, attended mostly visitors to the city.\\"  Answer: A:","output":"The Folies Bergère and Olympia Paris were both famous Paris institutions with some distinct differences. The main difference between the two was the style of the shows and the atmospheres they offered. While the Olympia Paris was known for its grand staircase, providing a unique setting for its shows, the Folies Bergère had a more sensual and risqué touch to its performances. The Folies Bergère, established in 1869, gained fame by presenting light and entertaining shows that often featured semi-nude female performers along with music and dance numbers. Its atmosphere was one of glamour, allure, and daring, appealing to a diverse audience looking for excitement and fun. The Folies Bergère became a symbol of the Belle Époque era in Paris, with its lavish and opulent productions. It attracted many great performers including Mistinguett and Édith Piaf, and also had close associations with famous artists like Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec who made posters for the venue. On the other hand, the Olympia Paris, which opened in 1911, primarily focused on musical performances. It introduced the grand staircase as a focal point of its shows, creating a more sophisticated and elegant atmosphere. The Olympia Paris featured renowned artists such as Josephine Baker, Maurice Chevalier, Marlene Dietrich, and Tino Rossi, and hosted concerts by legendary musicians like Miles Davis, Judy Garland, and the Grateful Dead. In summary, the main difference between the Folies Bergère and the Olympia Paris is the type of performances each venue was known for. While the Folies Bergère was famous for its sensual and risqué shows, the Olympia Paris took a more refined approach with its grand staircase and music-focused performances."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

However, given the context and the speaker's response, we can infer that the man likely proposed an idea or made a statement that seemed bold and potentially demanding to the speaker. Here's a plausible scenario that could have triggered such a response: The man could have playfully or earnestly suggested that the speaker should come to visit him in his city or asked her out on a date, despite being 350 miles away. This proposal would likely surprise the speaker and cause her to be amused by his boldness. In response, she decides to share her reasons for not being able to consider such an offer at this point in her life. Her reasons include:  1. Gas prices: This could mean she's either concerned about the financial aspect of traveling such a long distance or the inadequate fuel efficiency of her vehicle. 2. Fibromyalgia: As a chronic illness that causes widespread pain and fatigue, fibromyalgia may limit the speaker's ability to travel long distances comfortably. By clarifying her reasons, the speaker aims to provide a truthful response and indirectly communicates the distance she is willing to cover when it comes to relationships.

This was especially \\"odd\\" because it wasn't the kind of film Lynch had been putting out in the last 15 -20 years. Those were dark and shocking films (Blue Velvet, Wild At Heart, Mulholland Drive) and this is the opposite. I know it disappointed a lot of his fans. Others were delighted by it. Count me as one of the latter, and I own all three of those \\"dark\\" films, too. This was another supposed-true life story, here detailing an elderly man's trip in a seated lawnmower from western Iowa all the way to Wisconsin to see his ailing brother who he hasn't talked to in years but wants to see before the latter dies. Well, I guess that premise - an old man driving a lawn mower 400 miles - still makes this an \\"odd\\" film of sorts, so Lynch stays in character with that!  Richard Farnsworth plays the title role. He is the type of guy, face-wise, voice-wise, low-key personality-wise, that just about everyone likes. The wrinkles on his face tell many a story. It was so sad to hear what happened to him in real life a year after this film was released. The first 25 minutes of this film isn't much, and not always pleasant as it shows the main character's adult and mentally-challenged child (Sissy Spacek) and her tragic past, but once Alvin Straight (Farnsworth) begins his trip, the story picks up. I played this for several friends and they thought the film NEVER picked up, but I am more generous with it. I think it's a hidden gem. To them, it was a sleeping pill. I found his trip pretty fascinating but you have to realize in advance this is NOT going to be a suspenseful Lynch crime story. It IS slow and if that's okay with you, you might like this. Charm enters the picture in some of people Alvin meets along the way, such as a wayward young girl running away and some nice town folks who help the old man out when he gets in trouble. (Henry Cada as \\"Daniel Riordan, is a standout in that regard.) Harry Dean Stanton gets third billing, but that's a joke: he's only in the final few minutes of the movie!

Fortunately, although two-thirds of the buildings were destroyed during the excesses of the Chinese Cultural Revolution, they were mainly the residences for the 4,000 monks and the monastery itself was not as extensively damaged as most other religious structures in Tibet, for it was the seat of the Panchen Lama who remained in Chinese-controlled territory. However, during 1966 Red Guards led a crowd to break statues, burn scriptures and open the stupas containing the relics of the 5th to 9th Panchen Lamas, and throw them in the river. Some remains, though, were saved by locals, and in 1985, Choekyi Gyaltsen, 10th Panchen Lama, began the construction of a new stupa to house them and honour his predecessors. It was finally consecrated on 22 January 1989, just six days before he died aged fifty-one at Tashi Lhunpo. \\"It was as if he was saying now he could rest.\\" How many years was it between the REd Guards leading a crowd to open stupas containing relics of 5th to 9th Panchen Lamas and the 10th Panchen Lama beginning construction on a new stupa?","output":"The Red Guards led a crowd to open stupas containing relics of the 5th to 9th Panchen Lamas in 1966.

Article: Today, I felt terrible. My head was full of problems and confusion . I decided to take a walk even though I didn't know where to go. The most special thing happened when I was out for this walk. I saw an old man sitting on a chair. He was a seller of second-hand shoes. I thought he looked at least 70 years old. He seemed so tired and nobody was buying his shoes. I wanted to give him something but I had not brought anything with me. Then, a little girl came toward him. I heard the child say, \\"Grandfather, may I polish   your shoes?\\" That old man took pity on her, smiled and gave her a shoe to polish. The girl told him she needed money to buy her brother a new school uniform. \\"Oh, little girl. Just stop doing this. Come with me and I will buy you a uniform.\\" Then they walked to a market , and he bought her brother a uniform. The girl said \\"thanks\\" to him and left, leaving the old man smiling. He walked away from the market, but I stopped him. I whispered in his ear, \\"You are a hero! Thank you for your kindness!\\"  As I walked away, I looked back and I could see him still smiling. I was blown away by the kindness I had just seen.  Someone who had so little was so generous! Amazing! My own sadness had completely disappeared, chased way by the light of this kind act. I began realizing that I have a lot to be thankful for. I hope, some day, I can show my appreciation   of what I have by following the example of the old man.

He was amazed to find that ten thousand years ago there were plenty of rainfall in that region. He labeled that era as era A. Then he found that rainfall deceased in the region about eight thousand years ago. He labeled that era as era B. He was wondering how that change in rainfall might have helped emerge the Egyptian civilization.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Would era B see higher or lower rate of weathering than era A?  Hint: Rainfall in an area is important because it influences the rate of weathering. More rain means that more rainwater passes through the soil. The rainwater reacts chemically with the particles. The top layers of soil are in contact with the freshest water, so reactions are greatest there. High rainfall increases the amount of rock that experiences chemical reactions. High rainfall may also carry material away. This means that new surfaces are exposed. This increases the rate of weathering. A:","output":"Era B would see a lower rate of weathering than Era A.

It was developed first by Commodore International and introduced with the launch of the first Amiga, the Amiga 1000, in 1985. Early versions of AmigaOS required the Motorola 68000 series of 16-bit and 32-bit microprocessors. Later versions were developed by Haage & Partner (AmigaOS 3.5 and 3.9) and then Hyperion Entertainment (AmigaOS 4.0-4.1). A PowerPC microprocessor is required for the most recent release, AmigaOS 4.  - A type-in program, type-in game or just type-in, is a computer program listing of source code printed in a computer magazine or book, meant to be typed in on the computer's keyboard by the reader in order to run the program.  - A microprocessor is a computer processor which incorporates the functions of a computer's central processing unit (CPU) on a single integrated circuit (IC), or at most a few integrated circuits. The microprocessor is a multipurpose, clock driven, register based, programmable electronic device which accepts digital or binary data as input, processes it according to instructions stored in its memory, and provides results as output. Microprocessors contain both combinational logic and sequential digital logic. Microprocessors operate on numbers and symbols represented in the binary numeral system.  - In computing, source code is any collection of computer instructions, possibly with comments, written using a human-readable programming language, usually as ordinary text. The source code of a program is specially designed to facilitate the work of computer programmers, who specify the actions to be performed by a computer mostly by writing source code. The source code is often transformed by an assembler or compiler into binary machine code understood by the computer. The machine code might then be stored for execution at a later time. Alternatively, source code may be interpreted and thus immediately executed.  - Atari is a corporate and brand name owned by several entities since its inception in 1972, currently by Atari Interactive, a subsidiary of the French publisher Atari, SA (ASA).

Turn the breakers and gas back on.\\" Article:","output":"Title: Installing Your Gas Dryer: A Step-by-Step Guide Introduction Among the many household appliances that have evolved over the years, dryers have come a long way in terms of their efficiency and overall capabilities. Buying a new gas dryer can be an exciting investment, but it often comes with the big question of how to set it up properly. In this article, we will guide you through the process of installing your new gas dryer in a few easy steps, ensuring that it is securely connected and ready to use. Step 1: Attach the Power Cord The first step in installing your new gas dryer is to connect the power cord. Most gas dryers come with a three-prong or four-prong power cord, depending on your home's electrical sockets. It is crucial to properly attach the power cord to the dryer and ensure that it is firmly secured. We recommend following these steps: 1. Locate the terminal block at the back of the dryer. 2. Remove the terminal block cover, usually held in place by a couple of screws. 3. Connect the power cord wires to the terminal block according to the manufacturer's guidelines. The wires are typically color-coded: black (hot), red (hot), and white (neutral). If the power cord has a green wire, it should be connected to the dryer's grounding point or green screw. 4. Secure the cord by tightening the screws that hold the wires to the terminal block. 5. Replace the terminal block cover. Step 2: Move the Dryer into Its Final Position Once the power cord is securely attached, it is time to move the dryer into its final position. Consider the following tips to help you move and position your dryer: 1. Measure the space where the dryer will be placed to ensure that there is enough room for ventilation and access. There should be at least a few inches of space between the wall and the dryer. 2. Carefully slide the dryer into its final position, using a dolly or assistance from a friend if needed. Make sure not to damage any flooring or nearby objects in the process. 3. Ensure that the dryer is positioned close enough to the gas supply line and electrical outlet. Step 3: Level the Dryer Once the dryer is in place, it is essential to level the unit. An uneven dryer can cause vibrations, noise, and even potential damage to the appliance. To level the dryer, follow these steps: 1. Place a level on top of the dryer to check its alignment. 2. If the dryer is not level, adjust the dryer feet by turning them clockwise or counterclockwise until the desired level is achieved. 3. Recheck the level and make any necessary adjustments until the dryer is perfectly balanced. Step 4: Turn the Breakers and Gas Back On With the dryer correctly positioned and leveled, it's now time to restore power and gas to the appliance. 1. Turn on the circuit breaker responsible for supplying power to the dryer. 2. Open the gas supply valve to reconnect the gas line to the dryer. You may need to double-check your dryer's user manual to ensure that the gas valve is connected properly. 3. Plug the power cord into the electrical outlet. 4. Once everything is connected, test your dryer by turning it on and ensuring that it heats up properly. If you detect any issues or smell gas, turn off the appliance immediately and contact a professional for assistance. Conclusion Installing a gas dryer is a straightforward process if you follow these essential steps. With your power cord properly attached, your dryer positioned and leveled, and your breakers and gas supply restored, you can now enjoy the efficiency and convenience of your new appliance. Remember, if you encounter any difficulty during the installation process, do not hesitate to consult your dryer's user manual or contact a professional for assistance."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Raven Is Randy favorite character in the cartoon Matthew hates to watch,","output":"Raven is Randy's favorite character in the cartoon Matthew hates to watch, much to the surprise of their friends who cannot understand the stark contrast in their preferences. Randy, an avid fan of the show, never misses an episode and often mentions the captivating storylines that surround Raven, a mysterious and powerful character with an intriguing backstory. He believes that the character's complexity, impressive abilities, and the emotional depth demonstrated through her interactions with other characters make Raven the absolute best part of the cartoon. Randy's appreciation for Raven extends beyond the screen, as he also collects comics, action figures, and other memorabilia featuring her likeness. On the other hand, Matthew simply cannot understand the fascination or appeal of the cartoon. He has tried watching it on multiple occasions, hoping to see what his friend Randy admires so much, but he finds it difficult to connect with the characters or appreciate the plotlines. The animation style is also not to his liking, which contributes to his overall disdain for the show. This difference in opinion between the two friends often leads to friendly debates, with each side attempting to validate their viewpoint and convince the other. However, despite these differing opinions, they respect each other's right to enjoy (or not enjoy) the cartoon in their own way. The key to their friendship is the understanding that, despite their contrasting taste in entertainment, they both hold valid opinions and can coexist in harmony. As time goes on, the friends continue to explore new shows, movies, and other forms of media together, with some becoming shared interests and others remaining singular passions. While it's likely that neither Randy nor Matthew will ever fully convince the other of the merits of their favorite (or least favorite) cartoon, their mutual respect allows them to continue engaging in these discussions and expanding their exposure to differing opinions and perspectives. In conclusion, the sentence ends by highlighting the difference in preferences between Randy and Matthew, emphasizing their contrasting opinions and emphasizing the importance of mutual respect and understanding in their friendship despite these differences."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Being in a relationship with someone who sulks can, over time, damage your own self-confidence and wellbeing, making you wonder if you’re to blame. It’s not your fault—your partner is responsible for fixing their own behaviour, not you. Essentially, your partner needs to learn how to soothe and “parent” themselves before they’re able to be in a healthy relationship. It can be hard not to respond in anger or by sulking yourself, but work on staying open to communication. Tell them that coming to you directly and talking about it is perfectly fine—and you’re much more likely to respond in a loving way if they talk about it rather than sulk about it.  If they’re finally able to sit down and talk about the problem, encourage them to tell you what triggered this response and how they felt.  For example, they might say “You were half an hour late to dinner, which made me feel like you didn’t care” or “I saw you laughing and talking to another man, which made me think that you like him instead of me. I was jealous.” This may feel unnatural at first because it’s a very vulnerable and straightforward manner of communication. However, once your significant other starts talking to you this way, you’ll be able to address the problem much more easily. If your significant other is still struggling with this or is becoming more and more controlling, look into getting professional help through counselling. Go through the counselling process can help your partner realize that sulking hurts both themself and the people around them.  Counselors can give you some advanced techniques for dealing with this behaviour as well.  A couples therapist may even see both of you separately to help determine the source of the issue for both partners. The counselor can then help you work through individual issues. If your partner can’t break this pattern of behaviour or if your relationship has become unhealthy, a counselor can also help you evaluate whether or not you should stay together.  To find a good couples therapist, ask your doctor for a recommendation or check online at websites like the American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy or GoodTherapy.org. if you don’t see any changes. If you’ve made it clear that this behaviour is unacceptable and you still don’t see any changes in your lover’s behaviour, it’s probably time to go your separate ways. It is not your responsibility to continually validate their immaturity, jealousy, and insecurity. That isn’t fair to you or healthy for either party.  Because your partner is already prone to bad behaviour like sulking, the process of breaking up may be extra difficult and emotional. For a safe and healthy breakup, be respectful but firm. Tell your partner why you want to break up and set clear boundaries. For example, you could say “I can’t stay in this relationship if you can’t communicate with me when you’re upset. It seems like you have some emotional issues to work through, and I wish you all the best, but we need to go our separate ways.”","output":"In a relationship with a partner who often sulks, it is important to recognize that it is not your responsibility to fix their behavior, but rather, they need to learn to manage their emotions and effectively communicate their feelings. Continuous sulking can negatively impact your self-confidence and well-being, so it is crucial to encourage open communication and allow your partner to express their feelings, even if it feels vulnerable at first. This can lead to a better understanding of underlying issues and enable you to address problems more effectively. If your partner struggles with this type of behavior or becomes controlling, consider seeking professional help through couples counseling.

Choices:  - toy store - basement - school - rest area - building  The rationale to choose \\"rest area\\" as the answer is that: A:","output":"The rationale to choose \\"rest area\\" as the answer is based on several factors that make it the most suitable and convenient option for John's specific needs related to his RV's electricity requirements for cooking lunch. 1. Availability of amenities: Rest areas are designated locations usually found along highways or major roads, specifically designed to provide a range of facilities and amenities for travelers and their vehicles. These facilities generally include restrooms, picnic tables, drinking water, and crucially, electrical hookups for RVs and other large vehicles. This would make it an ideal place for John to get the electricity he needs to cook lunch in his RV. 2. Convenience for RV users: Rest areas are intentionally designed to accommodate a variety of vehicle types, including RVs. Typically, these areas have large parking spaces and easy access from the main roads, making it convenient for John to maneuver his RV and find a suitable spot to plug in. 3. Safety and cleanliness: Rest areas are maintained by highway authorities or local governments, which means they follow certain standards of hygiene and safety. This ensures that John can confidently plug in his RV and use the electricity to cook without worrying about potential safety hazards. 4. Cost efficiency: Many rest areas offer free or relatively low-cost electrical hookups for RVs compared to private RV parks or campgrounds. This would be a practical and wallet-friendly option for John to get the electricity needed for cooking his lunch. 5. Traveler-oriented services: As rest areas cater to the needs of travelers, they often have additional services such as tourist information, vending machines, and waste disposal facilities. These services can contribute to making John's overall travel experience more pleasant and enjoyable. In contrast, the other choices like toy stores, basements, schools, or generic buildings are not specifically designed to cater to the electricity needs of RV users, nor do they have designated spaces for parking and plugging in RVs. They could also present restrictions, safety concerns, or difficulties in terms of access and security for John and his RV. Therefore, based on the factors listed above, the \\"rest area\\" is the most appropriate choice for John to plug in his RV, as it provides him with the necessary electricity to cook lunch while also ensuring the safety, convenience, and cost-efficiency he requires for a comfortable and enjoyable experience."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Consider how the update affects the hypothesis: Does it make it more likely (strengthener) or less likely (weakener) to believe that the two people in the tree are boys? 7. In this case, the update is neutral, neither a strengthener nor a weakener, because it does not provide any information that would make you more or less likely to believe that the two people in the tree are boys. Seeing far ahead is an ability that does not depend on the gender of the individuals. However, since you need to choose between strengthener and weakener, you could consider the update as a subtle strengthener. The fact that they can see very far could imply that they chose a high branch to climb, a behavior more commonly associated with boys.

Process: - A red giant burns mass - This mass creates high core temperatures - The mass decreases - The red giant can no longer fuse the carbon and oxygen in its center - The gravity of the star can no longer hold the outside layers - The layers break away - Only the inner core remains - This inner core is known as a white dwarf.  Question: suppose less leaves fall on the ground happens, how will it affect More mass is burned by the red giant.  - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","output":"B: Less To fully understand the relationship between the decrease in fallen leaves and the effect on the burning mass of a red giant, we must first examine each part of the scenario separately. First, let's consider the process of a red giant star. A typical red giant star goes through several stages during its lifetime. Initially, it burns hydrogen at its core, fusing it into helium. As the hydrogen fuel becomes depleted, the star contracts and the core temperature increases. At some point, the helium begins to burn, fusing into carbon and oxygen. With the decrease in mass, the remaining helium ignites in a shell around the core. This process causes the outer layers of the red giant to expand. Eventually, the mass decreases to the point where the star can no longer withstand the gravitational forces, and the outer layers vanish. This leaves behind a dense core called a white dwarf. Now let's look at the situation involving the fallen leaves. For the sake of this hypothetical, we will assume that the decrease in fallen leaves is a direct result of a reduced amount of photosynthesis occurring in plant life. Photosynthesis has an impact on the carbon cycle, which in turn affects the broader ecosystem and the chemical processes that occur within it, including the elements available for stellar fusion. Understanding these separate processes, we can now answer the question of how less leaves falling on the ground will affect the mass burning in a red giant. Lesser leaves mean that less carbon dioxide is being absorbed by plant life through photosynthesis. This reduction will eventually cause a minor but noticeable shift in the balance of elements in the environment, including the availability of carbon. Since carbon fusion is a critical part of the red giant's life cycle as it transitions from burning helium to the eventual, inevitable collapse into a white dwarf, a decrease in the availability of carbon in the stellar environment would mean that the red giant's remaining mass would burn at a slower rate. Consequently, it will take longer for the star to reach the point at which it can no longer continue the fusion process (resulting in shedding its outer layers and contracting into a white dwarf). In conclusion, a decrease in the number of fallen leaves, which indicates a decrease in the carbon dioxide absorption by plant life through photosynthesis, would ultimately affect the availability of carbon, thus causing a red giant to burn mass at a slower rate. This supports the answer \\"B: Less.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. First question: Do athletes live longer and healthier? If not, why? Second question: Health: Why is it desirable to live a longer, healthier life? Are these two questions asking the same thing? Choices: [-] no. [-] yes.","output":"First question: Do athletes live longer and healthier? If not, why? Athletes generally tend to live longer and healthier lives compared to non-athletes, but there are some factors to consider. There are several reasons behind this difference, including: 1. Physical Fitness: Athletes typically engage in regular exercise, leading to better cardiovascular health, lower body weight, and a reduced risk of chronic diseases such as diabetes and hypertension. These factors contribute to a longer and healthier life. 2. Healthier Lifestyle: Athletes are more likely to maintain a healthier lifestyle by consuming nutrient-rich diets, sleeping adequately, and avoiding substance abuse such as smoking and excessive alcohol intake. A balanced diet and good nutrition are essential factors that contribute to longevity and overall health. 3. Mental Health: Physical activity and sports participation have been found to have positive effects on mental health. Exercise releases endorphins, which can help reduce stress, anxiety, and depression. In addition, athletes often have a strong sense of discipline and goal-setting, which can contribute to better mental health and resilience. However, there are some downsides to being an athlete: 1. Injuries: Athletes, particularly those who participate in contact sports or high-impact activities, are more prone to injuries. These injuries can lead to long-term health issues, chronic pain, or even early retirement from sports. 2. Overtraining: Some athletes may push their bodies too far, resulting in overtraining syndrome. This can cause hormonal imbalances, decreased immunity, and increased risk of injury, which could affect an athlete's overall health and well-being. Second question: Health: Why is it desirable to live a longer, healthier life? Living a longer, healthier life is desirable because it allows individuals to experience a higher quality of life, enjoy more opportunities and experiences, and maintain their independence as they age. There are several reasons why longevity and health are valued: 1. Enhanced Quality of Life: A longer and healthier life allows people to engage in activities they enjoy, maintain strong social connections, and contribute to their communities. Optimal health enables individuals to minimize or avoid physical limitations and chronic illnesses, providing a greater sense of well-being and happiness. 2. Increased Opportunities and Experiences: Living a longer, healthier life opens doors to new opportunities, experiences, and personal growth. Whether it's traveling, pursuing hobbies, spending time with loved ones, or continuing to learn and develop new skills, good health gives people the chance to make the most of their time. 3. Financial Stability: By maintaining good health, individuals may be able to work longer, delay retirement, and reduce medical expenses associated with chronic diseases or disability. In turn, this can contribute to financial stability and peace of mind as they age. 4. Family and Social Connections: Living a longer, healthier life allows individuals to support and spend more time with their families, develop strong intergenerational relationships, and maintain social connections as they age. These relationships promote a sense of belonging and enhance mental well-being. To answer your last query, these two questions are not necessarily asking the same thing. The first question is about the longevity and health of athletes compared to non-athletes, while the second question focuses on the desirability of living a longer, healthier life in general. Although there is some overlap between the questions, they address different aspects of health and longevity. Therefore, the answer is: [-] no."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

These include a child regularly attending school unclean or with injuries, overtly sexual behaviours in children who are below the age of puberty, and parents using excessive physical punishment. Dr Danya Glaser, a consultant child and adolescent psychiatrist and member of the NICE guideline development committee, said professionals should use their instinct and experience to make a judgement. \\"It's probably a mixture of instinct and experience. It's about [noticing] some change in behaviour if you know the child.\\" Dr Glaser said there was \\"far more under-recognition\\" of child abuse than over-reporting of cases that then turned out to be untrue. \\"We are saying err on the side of curiosity - it might be nothing but it might be something.\\" Prof Corinne May-Chahal, chairwoman of the committee developing the guidelines, said the guidance would help professionals spot signs of abuse and focus on what help can be provided. \\"The guideline gives examples of soft signs, the behaviours or emotions a child is exhibiting, which could indicate something may be wrong. \\"These may not always be proof of abuse or neglect taking place, but they underline when to check on a child's wellbeing.\\" Prof Gillian Leng, deputy chief executive at NICE said: \\"We want all professionals to be aware and recognise when they need to ask questions or follow up with colleagues about a child's wellbeing. \\"Not all cases will cause concern but if we do not ask, we may miss opportunities to protect children in their time of need. \\"I guess we can be a bit British and perhaps aren't curious enough and think we shouldn't ask the questions, so I guess (the guideline is) permission to be curious.\\" A public consultation on the draft guidelines will run until 19 April.","output":"The UK's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) has produced draft guidelines to help professionals identify potential signs of child abuse.

There are several indicators in the text that signal the reviewer's strong disapproval and dissatisfaction with the product, which in this case is an album by the artist Noreaga, titled \\"God's Favorite.\\" First, the title of the review, \\"Is this guy kidding me?\\" establishes a negative tone right away. It suggests that the reviewer is in disbelief and frustration with the album, which they implied by asking rhetorically if the artist is joking with the content they produced. Several phrases and words throughout the review convey the extent of the reviewer's negative opinion on the album. They describe Noreaga as \\"straight up wack\\" and further emphasize that they've never written any other reviews saying \\"bad stuff\\" about an artist before, indicating that this instance was strong enough to warrant their criticism in a way other artists have not. The reviewer also notes that even though Noreaga's previous works were also \\"wack,\\" they could at least find some humor in the lyrics. However, they claim that in \\"God's Favorite,\\" the rhymes are no longer funny and therefore provide no redeemable qualities for the listener. The repetition of the word \\"wack\\" to describe both the artist and their work emphasizes the negative perspective, as \\"wack\\" is slang for low quality or unimpressive. In addition to the lyrics, the reviewer criticizes the album's beats, also calling them \\"wack.\\" They then make a direct appeal to other potential listeners, urging them not to support the album. This further solidifies the negative tone of the review, as the reviewer wants to dissuade others from giving it their attention or money. Finally, they specifically mention the worst song on the album in their view, \\"Mr. CEO.\\" By drawing attention to this particular track, the reviewer is emphasizing their overall dissatisfaction with the album. In summary, the product review has a decidedly negative tone, which is demonstrated through various expressions of the reviewer's disappointment, frustration, and lack of enjoyment of Noreaga's \\"God's Favorite\\" album."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: The film opens with the Russian-born novelistâwho eventually became a member of Freud's 'Vienna Circle'-- Lou Andreas-Salome (Katheryn Winnick) who had an unconsummated (Platonic) 'love affair' with German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche (Armand Assante), and to whom he allegedly proposed in 1882 (although whether her claims are true is very much up for debate) writing a letter to Dr Josef Breuer (Ben Cross), after hearing of his newly developed talking cure (Breuer was a friend of Sigmund Freud (Jamie Elman), who also appears in the story, and one of the influential fathers of psychoanalysis.). The two meet, and a reluctant and troubled Breuer agrees to Salome's plan; to cure the intense migraine attacks that plague Nietzsche, and at the same time, without his knowing, cure the despair that her refusal of marriage has inflicted upon him. Salome has persuaded Franz Overbeck (Nietzsche's friend) to send him to Breuer, however, Nietzsche offers no support to Breuer, so the course of treatment must end. In a chilling parallel, an encounter with a mistreated horse causes Nietzsche to redeem his appointment with Breuer (Nietzsche finally went mad after stopping a man from whipping a horse using his own body, before breaking down in tears and descending into insanity). Nietzsche later visits a whorehouse, where he has another attack of migraine, exacerbated by the overuse of a sleeping draught. Nietzsche decides that he will, instead of pursuing treatment, leave for Basel. Meanwhile, an up-and-coming psychologist Sigmund Freud, friend of Josef and Mathilde Breuer, suggests that if Breuer was to make some confession to Nietzsche, he may stop seeing any positive sentiment shown as being a bid for power, and indulge in confessions of his own. So, the next time they met, Breuer makes the suggestion that, while he treats Nietzsche's body, Nietzsche must \\"treat\\" Breuer of the despair that he feels after falling in love with one of his patients, Bertha Pappenheim (played by Michal Yannai), otherwise known as Anna O., a... A:","output":"The suggested title for this movie could be \\"Echoes of Despair: A Tale of Nietzsche and Freud\\".  This proposed title reflects the complex interplay between these prominent figures of philosophy and psychology — Nietzsche, Freud, and Breuer — each carrying their share of despair. \\"Echoes of Despair\\" suggests the recurring and underpinning theme of psychological torment at personal and professional levels. It leaves room for the enigmatic Lou Andreas-Salome, who plays a critical role in initiating the chain of events that binds these lives with a common thread.  \\"Echoes\\" implies a lingering aftermath of individual experiences, symbolizing Nietzsche's migraines and the emotional pain from Salome's rejection, Breuer's despair from being in love with his patient, and even Freud's attempts to steer through these convolutions. This word represents the motifs of psychoanalysis and philosophy that echo throughout the narrative. \\"Despair\\" encompass the primary psychological motif and is the tie that binds the main characters together. Each character experiences despair in different forms — Nietzsche, from a proposed unfulfilled love; Breuer, from an improper love towards a patient; and even Freud, through his struggle to decode the intricacies of the human mind. \\"A Tale of Nietzsche and Freud\\" refers to the movie's historical and psychological foundation — giving due credit to these figures who were influential in shaping modern thought. By placing their names in the title, it clearly indicates to potential viewers the level of discussion and intellectual narrative they might expect. Overall, the suggested title not only summarizes the core plot of the movie's storyline but also leaves sufficient intrigue for audiences till the end. The title is evocative, enigmatic, and encapsulates the web of relations, despair, and intellectualism within the film's plot. It sets an appropriate stage for the psychological, philosophical, and humanitarian themes that this movie brilliantly weaves together."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:What is the answer for the question: What was the full name of the person who continued to send troops to Béxar? from the following article ?  By October 9, Cos had taken over San Antonio de Béxar. Stephen F. Austin sent an advance scout troop of 90 men under James Bowie and James Fannin to observe the Mexican forces. While taking refuge at Mission Concepción on October 28, they repelled an attack by 275 Mexicans under Domingo Ugartechea during the battle. Austin continued to send troops to Béxar. Bowie was ordered on November 26 to attack a Mexican supply train alleged to be carrying a payroll. The resulting skirmish became known as the Grass Fight, after it was discovered that the only cargo was grass to feed the horses. When Austin was selected to join Branch T. Archer and William H. Wharton on a diplomatic mission to seek international recognition and support, Edward Burleson was named as commander. On December 5, James C. Neill began distracting Cos by firing artillery directly at the Alamo, while Benjamin Milam and Frank W. Johnson led several hundred volunteers in a surprise attack.  The fighting at the Siege of Béxar continued until December 9 when Cos sent word he wanted to surrender. Cos and his men were sent back to Mexico, but would later unite with Santa Anna's forces.Approximately 300 of the Texian garrison at Béxar departed on December 30 to join Frank W. Johnson and James Grant on the Matamoros Expedition, in a planned attack to seize the port for its financial resources. Proponents of this campaign were hoping Mexican Federalists would oust Santa Anna and restore the 1824 constitution. When Sesma crossed the Rio Grande, residents of the Gulf Coast began fleeing the area in January 1836. Santa Anna ordered General José de Urrea on February 16 to secure the Gulf Coast. About 160 miles (260 km) north of Matamoros at San Patricio, Urrea's troops ambushed Johnson and members of the expedition on February 27 at the Battle of San Patricio.

Claim: Incarceration is expensive, rehabilitation is not What evidence supports this claim?","output":"To find evidence that supports the claim that incarceration is expensive while rehabilitation is not, let's explore the costs associated with each approach and examine relevant research findings. Step 1: Research the costs of incarceration Incarceration involves imprisoning individuals convicted of crimes. Associated costs include the construction and maintenance of prison facilities, staffing, security measures, inmate meals, healthcare, and other expenses related to operating a penitentiary. Various studies have shown that the average cost per inmate per year in the United States is estimated to be around 31,000, although this figure can vary widely between states (Vera Institute of Justice, 2015). Step 2: Investigate the costs of rehabilitation programs Rehabilitation takes several forms, including drug and alcohol treatment programs, educational courses, job training, mental health treatment, and therapy or counseling. Assessing the costs of rehabilitation requires considering the costs of implementing and operating these various programs and the potential reduction in crime that may result from participation in these programs. Some studies have shown that rehabilitation programs can cost as low as 5,000 per participant annually (Washington State Institute for Public Policy, 2019). Step 3: Compare the costs and effectiveness of incarceration and rehabilitation A comparison of costs and effectiveness should take into account both the direct expenses and potential long-term outcomes associated with each approach. Studies have suggested that rehabilitation programs can be more cost-effective than incarceration, particularly in reducing rates of recidivism (the likelihood of a person re-offending). For example, a meta-analysis conducted by the Washington State Institute for Public Policy (2019) found that individuals participating in rehabilitation programs had a significantly lower rate of recidivating, which in turn led to long-term cost savings for the criminal justice system. Thus, the evidence supporting the claim that incarceration is expensive while rehabilitation is not includes: 1. The higher average annual cost of incarceration compared to rehabilitation programs. 2. The demonstrated effectiveness of rehabilitation programs in reducing recidivism rates, leading to long-term cost savings for the criminal justice system. While the specific cost savings of rehabilitation may fluctuate based on geographic location and year, the overall trends in research suggest that it is a less expensive and more effective approach to reducing crime than incarceration alone."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The vacuum that I bought was a lot better than the simple broom, because the","output":"vacuum cleaner offered numerous advantages that significantly improved the overall cleaning experience, making it more efficient, effective, and convenient compared to using a simple broom. Firstly, the vacuum's powerful suction capabilities allowed it to remove dirt, dust, and debris from various surfaces more effectively, ensuring a deeper and more thorough cleaning. This is particularly beneficial for individuals with allergies, as the vacuum effectively captures allergens like dust mites, pet dander, and pollen, reducing the likelihood of allergic reactions. In addition, vacuum cleaners are equipped with HEPA (High-Efficiency Particulate Air) filters, which trap microscopic particles and maintain clean air quality within the home. This feature is extremely important for those who suffer from asthma, allergies, or other respiratory issues, as it prevents the spread of harmful contaminants in the air. Moreover, the vacuum cleaner's versatility allows it to be used on a wider range of surfaces, such as carpets, hardwood floors, tile, and even upholstery. Most vacuums come with a variety of attachments, designed to help reach tight spaces, clean curtains, and easily pick up pet hair. This added functionality not only saves time but also improves the overall cleanliness of the home. In terms of convenience and ease of use, vacuum cleaners often come with features that make them user-friendly and easy to maintain. For example, most vacuums have a bagless design, eliminating the need to purchase and replace vacuum bags continuously. Instead, a simple dustbin can be detached, emptied, and reattached quickly and efficiently. Regarding ergonomics and user comfort, vacuum cleaners often come with height-adjustable handles, making it comfortable to use for people of varying heights. Furthermore, many vacuums have relatively long power cords, allowing the user to clean larger areas without having to switch power outlets constantly. Another important aspect to consider is the time and energy saved when using a vacuum cleaner compared to a broom. Sweeping with a broom can be labor-intensive and time-consuming, especially when trying to remove dirt from carpets and rugs. However, vacuums efficiently suck up the debris, reducing the time spent on cleaning tasks and leaving the user with more time for other activities. Lastly, vacuum cleaners contribute to better overall hygiene within the home. Since brooms often only push dirt around or even into the air, certain allergens and bacteria can remain in the living space. In contrast, vacuums are designed to contain dirt and debris, minimizing the risk of cross-contamination and significantly reducing the spread of germs and allergens. In conclusion, the vacuum cleaner I bought was a lot better than the simple broom, because it provided enhanced cleaning capabilities, improved air quality, versatility, convenience, comfort, and better overall hygiene. These features make the vacuum cleaner an indispensable tool for maintaining a clean and healthy living environment."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Apparently the cat loved Monica more than Christine because the cat would love bite","output":"Monica every now and then, but never Christine. It was quite fascinating to observe the different ways in which their furry friend expressed love and affection towards the two women. Monica, always an animal lover, cherished their little cat and believed that her bond with the feline was truly unique. Christine, on the other hand, couldn't help but feel a pang of jealousy each time she witnessed this display of love between Monica and the cat.  The love bites that the cat bestowed upon Monica were gentle, playful nibbles, a sign that their cat was comfortable and trusting in her presence. It was a behavioral quirk observed among felines when they felt secure and happy with their human companion. They would occasionally nibble on their loved one's skin, careful not to cause any actual pain, to exhibit their feelings. Monica felt incredibly grateful to have earned the cat's trust and love, given how notoriously picky felines could be when it came to forming connections with humans. Christine began to wonder why the cat did not give her the same love bites that it showered upon Monica. She tried various tactics to get closer to her furry companion, but none seemed to produce the same level of intimacy that her partner enjoyed. From buying the cat's favorite treats to gifting it new toys every now and then, Christine went out of her way to demonstrate her love and attentiveness. She even tried mimicking Monica's actions, hoping to trigger a similar response from the cat. Over time, Christine started to realize that perhaps it was not the cat's preference for Monica that was causing this discrepancy but rather her own approach to bonding with their feline friend. Whereas Monica spent time genuinely engaging with the animal and forming a bond based on trust, Christine's attempts were mostly rooted in a competitive desire to win the cat's love. Her intentions and actions were less genuine, which the cat could inherently sense. As their understanding of the situation evolved, Monica and Christine decided to work on deepening their bond with the cat together. They learned how to approach the cat as a unit, each respecting the other's differences in interacting with their feline companion. They acknowledged that forming a loving bond with the cat didn't hinge on receiving love bites but rather on cultivating a relationship rooted in trust and understanding. In time, Christine found her own unique way to bond with the cat. Instead of love bites, she was rewarded with gentle head butts and purring, as the cat chose to display its affection differently towards her. Eventually, both Monica and Christine celebrated their unique and special connections with the cat, realizing that love and trust could manifest in more than one way. The cat, Monica, and Christine continued to grow together, cherishing the distinct relationships they shared with one another. Each of them contributed to the loving atmosphere within their little family, even if the ways in which they expressed their love may have been different. It became a beautiful lesson for them all on the different forms that love can take and the importance of acknowledging and appreciating those differences within any relationship."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

How we've listened to music How we've listened to music How we've listened to music How we've listened to music How we've listened to music How we've listened to music How we've listened to music How we've listened to music How we've listened to music Editor's note: Mark Coleman is the author of \\"Playback: From the Victrola to MP3, 100 Years of Music, Machines and Money.\\" (CNN) -- The cassette tape is back! Or at least this is what the organizers of Cassette Store Day -- that's right, it's today -- would have us believe. Cassettes? Really? Let's play along, if only for nostalgia's sake. Fifty years after the prototype cassette was introduced at the 1963 Berlin Radio Show, a group of independent labels that release new cassettes have pulled together the global event celebrating and, they hope, stimulating the resurgence of prerecorded tapes. The day will be observed, according to the group's website, at roughly 100 retail stores and music venues in the U.S., Europe, Canada and South America, with tie-ins, new cassette releases and live performers pushing new tapes. Cassette releases from established bands like At the Drive-In and Flaming Lips will be vended, as well as tapes from underground artists like Grape Soda and Gold Bears on the Hope for the Tape Deck label. Anyone who remembers fumbling with a cassette deck while driving or listening as a tape unspooled and self-destructed in the tape deck or having to insert index finger or pen into the cassette in a usually vain attempt to rewind the hopelessly twisted tape must be asking a simple question: Why? In the seamless age of digital music, when seemingly every song ever recorded is available at the stroke of a few computer keys, why would anyone revive such a clunky and outmoded physical format? But consider: Even with the convenience and sheer abundance of music stored on MP3 files, cassettes (and vinyl) offer tangible and tactile pleasures that aren't readily available in the digital world. There's a sizable, and growing, subset of consumers who lust for musical objects that they can hold in their hands (and their hearts) as well as their ears. Anyone who remembers fumbling with a cassette deck while driving or listening as a tape unspooled and self-destructed in the tape deck ... must be asking a simple question: Why? \\"Metal and punk and noise people never stopped releasing cassettes,\\" says Scott Seward. He is a music critic and owner of John Doe Jr. Used Records and Books in Greenfield, Massachusetts. \\"Fans of that music have always collected tapes. Same with jam band and Grateful Dead fans until recent years. It's still a common format for a lot of Middle Eastern, Indian and Asian street or folk music too, because cassettes are so cheap to reproduce.\\" It's true. Cassettes have always been an alternative and were for many years something of an underdog in the musical format wars. Not long after prerecorded cassettes emerged in the vinyl-dominated marketplace, the 8-track tape format eclipsed them in popularity. That was largely because the Ford Motor Co. started offering 8-track players as an option on some of its cars beginning in 1966. The automobile would power sales of the 8-track format past the cassette in the music-mad '60s and '70s. Drivers could insert and remove the bulky 8-tracks with one hand. By 1975, incredibly, 8-track tapes were second only to vinyl records in terms of sales figures. Cassettes had already been a tough sell to audiophiles because until the advent of Dolby noise reduction in the '70s, their sound quality was muffled compared with vinyl records. Gradually that improved, just as new tape playback options emerged. Even before the Walkman, the portable stereos known as boom boxes boosted the popularity of cassettes in the urban areas where these hulking radio/tape players (aka ghetto blasters) were most often used. Boom boxes made music consumption a public event (often whether the public wanted it or not) while advancing the notion of portability. But consumers began to demand portable music players. In late 1979, Sony introduced the proto-Walkman. Retailing for 199, the Soundabout was a 14-ounce playback-only device that came with headphones and used standard-size cassettes. By 1981, the smaller and cheaper Walkman II was available. Hello, 80s? We miss you! When it comes to recorded music formats, portable equals personal. So it's no accident that the Walkman and similar devices became known as personal stereos in the early '80s. Soon, Walkman headphones were as ubiquitous as boom boxes on city streets. Thanks to the Walkman, the boom box and the cassette (and later the CD), sales of vinyl records plummeted during the '80s. In 1981, more than twice as many vinyl records as prerecorded cassettes were sold. By 1984, the numbers had flipped, and cassette sales outpaced vinyl for the first time. Despite the unsuccessful \\"Home Taping Is Killing Music\\" campaign of the early '80s, the ability to record one's own tapes was always a huge part of the cassette's appeal. Homemade mix tapes became a cultural touchstone for a generation (or two), functioning as diaries or journals and figuring in courtship rituals (see Rob Sheffield's affecting memoir \\"Love Is A Mix Tape\\"). When cassettes faded from the scene in the early '90s in the conquering wake of the CD, something unique -- personal -- got left behind. Gone, perhaps, but not forgotten. The pull of nostalgia is not the only motivation behind the recent cassette cult resurgence, but memories and recorded music are deeply -- some say neurologically -- intertwined. \\"There is that True Cult aspect,\\" Seward says. \\"It's an exclusivity thing. Cassettes just seem like a cooler thing to have for sale at your punk or noise show than a CDR. Black metal and power electronics sound fab on tape, though. Same with Miami bass music. I still listen to a lot of metal and rap on tape, and I make mix tapes from vinyl that sound amazing.\\" Even if Cassette Store Day fails to bring prerecorded cassettes back to commercial prominence, the event makes a telling point about our music consumption. Despite the digital revolution, if you dust off those outmoded physical formats like cassette tapes and vinyl records down in the basement, they produce more than memories: They play music. They still work. Their appeal, however sentimental, is stronger than mere nostalgia. Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Mark Coleman.

Long Queue vs Online Tickets You can either wait in line to get in or buy tickets online for specific time slots to bypass the line. Wait times can be anywhere from 30 minutes to 3+ hours and in the summer time, it’s common to wait for hours. I definitely recommend buying a ticket online. Keep in mind that they have a limited number of tickets for each time slot, so don’t wait too long to buy or you may be stuck in that loooooong line. We got quite a few less-then-friendly looks from those in the line when we bypassed the entire queue and went right in. C’est la vie (insert Gallic shrug here). For some inexplicable reason, the site says you must print your tickets if you buy them online. Given that most visitors to the catacombs are tourists with limited or no access to a printer, this seems particularly silly, but what can you do? Luckily, we were in a hotel with a small business center so we printed our tickets there. Online tickets cost quite a bit more (27€ compared to 12€ for adults and 10€ for those age 26 or under). Totally worth it if that works with your budget. Online tickets also come with an audio guide. If you buy tickets at the door, the guide is an extra 5€.

The U.S. Congress is one step closer to averting a government shutdown Thursday after the U.S. House easily passed a 1.3 trillion spending plan that would end months of the government operating under short-term spending bills. The measure, approved by a 256-167 vote, now goes to the Senate, which has until midnight Friday to approve it and avert the year’s third government closure. The massive bipartisan bill would keep the government funded until the end of September. Lawmakers had just hours to read the nearly 2,200-page bill released Wednesday night. Under Senate rules, a single senator can delay the vote but not stop it entirely. Senator Rand Paul has objected to the short time given to members to read the lengthy legislation. As of Thursday afternoon, the Senate was waiting to see how the vote would proceed, raising the prospect of another brief government shutdown.  With midterm elections looming in November, the bill likely marks the final time Capitol Hill will consider major legislation this year. The measure would fulfill President Donald Trump’s vow to boost military funding but provides funding for limited parts of his immigration agenda. The bill, which the White House said Trump supports, would give Trump a huge budget increase for the military, including a 2.4 percent pay raise for military personnel. “Today marks the beginning of a new era for the United States military,” House Speaker Paul Ryan said in a statement Thursday. “This legislation fulfills our pledge to rebuild the United States military.” After extensive negotiations between Republicans and Democrats, the bill also provides 1.6 billion for physical barriers and 150 kilometers (93 miles) of a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border, short of the 25 billion Trump requested for the project he repeatedly touted on the campaign trail while pledging Mexico would pick up the cost. According to the above context, answer the following question. What promise did the president make? Choose your answer from:  (A). not enough information  (B). an increase in the defense budget  (C). no spending on immigration  (D). a large pay raise for the senate","output":"From the context provided, the president, Donald Trump, made a couple of promises. However, based on the provided options, the relevant promise is (B). an increase in the defense budget.

Additionally, the bill would provide a 2.4 percent pay raise for military personnel and a substantial budget increase for the military, both of which are part of increasing the defense budget. While there is also mention of his promise regarding funding for an immigration agenda, specifically the U.S.-Mexico border wall, this doesn't align with option (C). Moreover, there's no allusion to a pay raise for the Senate as in option (D).

This introduction helps set the context for understanding the various processes that follow. Step 2: Engines produce carbon dioxide - Combustion of fossil fuels in engines, such as in automobiles or power plants, leads to the production of carbon dioxide, a major greenhouse gas. Step 3: Living things produce waste - Living organisms create waste products (biomass) through their metabolic activities. Step 4: Waste decomposes - Decomposers like bacteria and fungi break down waste products (biomass) into simpler compounds. Step 5: Decomposition produces methane - As organic waste decomposes, methane, another potent greenhouse gas, is released as a byproduct of the process. Step 6: Water evaporates - Water on Earth's surface evaporates due to solar energy, forming water vapor in the atmosphere. Step 7: Water vapor joins the atmosphere - Water vapor is added to the Earth's atmosphere and becomes one of the most prevalent greenhouse gases. Step 8: Carbon dioxide, water vapor, and methane are greenhouse gases - These gases trap heat in the Earth's atmosphere, which contributes to the greenhouse effect and can lead to climate change."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Yaida first became well known when her first single (\\"Howling\\" which included the track \\"How?\\") was released in 2000 on Aozora records, an independent label pre-dominantly distributing to the Kansai area of Osaka only, and reportedly sold in excess of 10,000 copies. Widespread airplay on Osaka's local radio stations and word-of-mouth resulted in both Yaida and Aozora records becoming the focus of a bidding war between the larger record companies for both recording and distribution contracts, the final Japanese distributing rights being sold to Toshiba-EMI with Aozora retaining artist control and independent label status.  - Albums of recorded music were developed in the early 20th century, first as books of individual 78rpm records, then from 1948 as vinyl LP records played at  rpm.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize the following: When choosing where to get inked, you will want to consider visibility, sensitivity, and discretion. This will set limitations, such as size, on your tattoo design. Think hard about whether you want the tattoo to be visible to everyone, in which case you can consider tattooing your arms or legs, or whether you want it to be more private, in which case you would want to consider tattooing your lower back, shoulders, or stomach. A larger or more intricate tattoo made with different sizes of needles will also likely hurt more, especially given that thicker needles tend to hurt more than thinner ones since they pierce more skin. Also keep in mind that different spots on the body have varying sensitivities. Bonier parts of the body and parts with little fat tend to be more painful. The wrists, for example, are highly sensitive, so it could hurt more to get inked there.  Pain is subjective. Some claim that the initial outline of the tattoo is more painful, especially if this is your first experience getting inked, and others claim that the shading is more uncomfortable since the artist is going over the same areas over and over, packing color or ink. If you want to avoid shading, however, you should pick a simple, minimalistic tattoo design.  Pain is part of the process, so prepare yourself. Remember that it's worth it-- you'll end up with a one-of-a-kind tattoo! Tattoo color can affect the design you create - color tattoos, for example, may be better suited for smaller designs so that you have fewer touch-ups to do. Black and gray tattoos age better than color tattoos over time, are typically less expensive, and take less time to complete. Color tattoos allow for more creativity, are great for covering existing tattoos, and contrast strongly with light to medium skin tones.  Ask your tattoo artist for their recommendation on the type of coloring you should get. You might also want to consider getting a tattoo made out of white ink, depending on the type of design that you want to create and on the visibility you want the tattoo to have. White ink tattoos will often be less visible than monochrome or color ones.","output":"When deciding where to get a tattoo, it is important to consider factors such as visibility, sensitivity, and discretion, as these factors will affect aspects like the size and design of your tattoo. You must determine whether you want your tattoo to be easily visible to others, in which case arms or legs are suitable locations, or if you prefer it to be more private, considering areas like the lower back, shoulders, or stomach. The type of tattoo and needles used can also influence pain levels during the tattooing process. Larger and more intricate tattoos may cause more discomfort, particularly when thicker needles are used, as they pierce a larger area of skin. Different body parts also have varying levels of sensitivity, causing certain areas, like the wrists, to be more painful than others. While some people find the initial outline of the tattoo to be more painful, others claim that shading causes more discomfort due to the repeated actions of the artist. If you want to minimize pain, you could opt for a simple, minimalistic tattoo design. Pain tolerance is subjective, and enduring discomfort is part of the tattooing experience. Ultimately, the process results in a unique and personal piece of body art. When it comes to selecting the colors for your tattoo, consider aspects such as maintenance, cost, and personal preferences. Black and gray tattoos tend to age better, are less expensive, and require less time to complete, while color tattoos offer more flexibility, are ideal for covering existing tattoos, and provide a strong contrast on lighter skin tones. It's advisable to consult with your tattoo artist for recommendations on the best coloring options for your design. Another option to explore is using white ink, which offers a unique appearance and is often less visible when compared to monochrome or color tattoos. Ultimately, the choice of design, size, placement, and color should reflect your personal preferences and desired level of visibility."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Nick used less of it last year.;","output":"William needed more wood this winter than Nick because Nick used less of it last year. This difference in wood consumption can be attributed to several factors that played a role in their individual usage patterns. While both William and Nick have similar sized houses and heating systems, their lifestyles and personal choices affected the quantity of firewood needed to heat their homes. Last year, Nick made a conscious effort to reduce his carbon footprint and turned to alternative methods of heating, such as investing in energy-efficient electric radiators and insulating his home better with high-quality insulation materials. Consequently, he managed to decrease his dependency on wood as a primary source of heat. Furthermore, Nick's flexible work schedule allowed him to spend more time away from home during the colder months, traveling to warmer climates. This resulted in less time spent at his house during winter and hence a lesser demand for wood to heat it. In contrast, William had a significantly different approach. He continued using wood as the main heating source due to its affordability and accessibility in their rural community. William considered electric heaters too expensive and impractical for his larger than average household. He also preferred the cozy ambiance that a wood fire creates, making it an essential part of his family's winter activities. Additionally, unlike Nick, William had a demanding full-time job in their town, which kept him at home during the winter months. Another factor contributing to the difference in wood consumption was the harshness of the previous winter. As William's house was located at a higher elevation, it was more exposed to the elements and faced much colder temperatures, resulting in an increased need for heating. Nick's home, being at a lower elevation, experienced milder winter conditions. This geographical variation further amplified the difference in their wood usage. Lastly, the social dynamics of their households played a role too. William often hosted large family gatherings and events during the winter, further increasing the need for more heating and thereby raising the demand for wood. On the other hand, Nick preferred to spend his time alone or with a smaller circle of friends, causing less strain on his heating resources. In conclusion, William needed more wood this winter than Nick because of a variety of factors. Nick's conscious efforts to reduce his carbon footprint and use alternative heating methods, his flexible work schedule that let him travel during the winter, the difference in their homes' elevation, and their contrasting social lifestyles all contributed to the disparity in firewood consumption between these two neighbors."},{"instruction":"You are a teacher.

Fibroblasts were cultured from conjunctival specimens of healthy donors. Eosinophils were cultured on confluent monolayers of conjunctival fibroblasts or in culture medium alone. Eosinophil survival was evaluated by the trypan blue exclusion test. Eosinophil adherence was assessed by counting the attached cells after washing the cultures. Eosinophil viability and adherence in coculture were also assessed in the presence of anti-granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), anti-interleukin (IL)-3, and anti-IL-5 neutralizing antibodies. Cocultured eosinophils were activated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) after 4 days in culture, and eosinophil peroxidase (EPO) release was determined as a marker of their activation.', 'Eosinophils cocultured with conjunctival fibroblasts had a significantly increased viability of 35.9% (P = 0.004) and 12.8% (P = 0.003) on days 4 and 8, respectively. Fibroblast-conditioned medium did not enhance the survival of eosinophils. The increase in eosinophil survival in coculture was partially inhibited by anti-GM-CSF (P = 0.019), anti-IL-3 (P = 0.033), or anti-IL-5 (P = 0.011), whereas eosinophil adherence was reduced by anti-GM-CSF alone (P = 0.034). LPS activation of eosinophils cultured for 4 days with conjunctival fibroblasts induced higher EPO release than in freshly isolated eosinophils (P = 0.01).Question: Do conjunctival fibroblasts enhance the survival and functional activity of peripheral blood eosinophils in vitro? Student:","output":"Yes, according to the provided context, conjunctival fibroblasts enhance both the survival and functional activity of peripheral blood eosinophils in vitro. Eosinophils co-cultured with conjunctival fibroblasts significantly increased their viability on both days 4 and 8 post-treatment. This suggests that the presence of fibroblasts promotes longer survival of eosinophils. Furthermore, eosinophils cultured with fibroblasts demonstrated enhanced functional activity as they were activated by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) after 4 days in culture, resulting in a higher release of eosinophil peroxidase (EPO), which was used as a marker of their activation. However, the increase in eosinophil survival was partially inhibited by antibodies against GM-CSF, IL-3, or IL-5, and eosinophil adherence was reduced by anti-GM-CSF alone. It should be noted, though, that fibroblast-conditioned medium did not enhance eosinophil survival, indicating that direct contact or close proximity with the fibroblasts may be necessary for the enhancement effect."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Options: - learn - keep score - try to win - fun - require time to be kept  Explain why a human would choose \\"keep score\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","output":"A human would choose \\"keep score\\" to answer the question above because keeping score is an effective way to determine the winner in most games. In many competitive activities and sports, the primary objective is to achieve a better result than the opponents, which is typically quantified through a scoring system. The process of keeping score involves recording and tracking points, goals, or other game-specific metrics that contribute to a player or team's overall standing. As the game progresses, the scores will change based on the players' performance and actions during the match. When the game reaches its conclusion, whether through the completion of all rounds, allotted time, or meeting victory conditions, the player/team with the highest score is determined to be the winner.  This method allows for a transparent and objective way to determine the outcome of the competition. By comparing scores, participants can easily assess their performance and identify potential areas of improvement. Furthermore, keeping score creates a sense of accomplishment and adds an element of excitement to the game, making it more engaging and enjoyable for participants and spectators alike. While other options mentioned, such as learning, trying to win, and having fun, are essential aspects of playing games, they do not directly contribute to determining who wins in a game. Learning is a process that happens during gameplay, but it doesn't dictate the game's outcome. Similarly, trying to win should be every competitor's goal, but it doesn't help to figure out who actually wins. Lastly, having fun is a crucial aspect of playing games but does not relate to determining a winner. The option \\"require time to be kept\\" can be relevant in some games to control the match's duration, but it doesn't help to figure out the winner itself.

A new phase of drilling for shale gas, which the Government hopes will revolutionise Britain’s energy supply, was given the go-ahead yesterday. The controversial technique of extracting the gas from subterranean rock – known as fracking – was suspended last year after it was believed to have caused two small earthquakes in Lancashire. Energy Secretary Ed Davey said new conditions had now been imposed to minimise the risk of seismic activity. Scroll down for video. However, he did recognise the environmental concerns of those living near shale gas wells, which could soon spring up in many parts of the country. Fears have been expressed over possible water pollution and nuisance from lorries transporting equipment, but Mr Davey pledged to address them. ‘It is essential that shale gas development should not come at the expense of local communities,’ he said. ‘Fracking must be safe and the public must be confident that it is safe. ‘We are strengthening the stringent regime already in place with new  controls around seismic risks. And as the industry develops we will remain vigilant to all emerging evidence to ensure the local environment is protected.’ Advocates of fracking – the process by which water and chemicals are pumped into shale deposits at high pressure to release trapped pockets of gas – say it will end our dependence on expensive imports and protect consumers from rising prices, as North Sea gas reserves dwindle. David Cameron this week backed the technology and said Britain should be at the heart of the shale ‘gas revolution’, claiming it could bring down the price of household energy bills. Lib Dem Mr Davey was more cautious yesterday, saying only that shale gas would hold down future gas price rises rather than slash them, as has happened in the US. Nearly two-thirds of the country could be sitting on estimated gas reserves of up to 300trillion cubic feet, according to industry experts – enough to supply Britain for 120 years. But it is not yet clear how much of the trapped gas is recoverable, with drilling so far restricted to Lancashire, where energy firm Cuadrilla Resources has dug four exploratory wells. When it announced its finds last year, Cuadrilla said it would drill up to 800 wells over 16 years and, if production was successful, it could create thousands of jobs and generate £5billion-£6billion in tax revenues. The Department of Energy and Climate Change has granted 176 exploration licences across Britain, although holders still require further consent before fracking can commence. It is thought fracking will not begin again until late March at the earliest because Cuadrilla will need to secure fresh planning permission for its wells. There is growing local concern about fracking in Lancashire, as well as other areas thought to be rich in shale gas such as Sussex and South Wales. The Campaign to Protect Rural England yesterday warned of a greater backlash if large areas of countryside were ‘transformed into industrial sites’ with a steady stream of lorries transporting gas and polluted water away from drilling sites. Controversial: Drilling in the Blackpool area last year caused a small earthquake but the Government wants to expand the use of fracking in Britain. Paul Miner, the CPRE’s senior planning officer, said: ‘The Government doesn’t appear to have recognised the potential for major landscape damage, or the need to properly consider this at the local level.’ The rural splendour of George Osborne’s constituency in Cheshire could be blighted by his enthusiasm for shale gas exploration. Tatton. includes unspoilt countryside, the historic towns of Knutsford and. Wilmslow, and villages such as Alderley Edge – said to have more. millionaires per square mile than anywhere else in the country. Professor. Peter Styles of Keele University said the rocks in Tatton are of. interest to energy firms as they are from the same period as those in. Lancashire, where exploratory drilling suggests there could be enough. shale gas to power Britain for decades. He added shale gas exploration. requires ‘around a football pitch worth of land’ per site. A. report from the Royal Academy of Engineering also lists Cheshire as an. area of interest for ‘fracking’ – the technique used to extract the gas. But. exploration in the area could be opposed by residents, who have been. swift to protest against threats to the countryside in the past. Concerns have also been raised that fracking could pose a threat to Bath’s world-famous hot springs if a test-drill for gas was allowed in the area by the local authority. In the US, households near to wells have complained of increased traffic and polluted water supplies. But the Institute of Directors stressed that if the environmental fears could be allayed, shale gas offered great potential for the future. Its senior economic adviser Corin Taylor said the UK’s energy mix must include more gas, along with green energy and nuclear power, to meet carbon targets. And energy minister John Hayes added that the Government had taken ‘the very best’ scientific advice on fracking and said: ‘We have out every safeguard in place; this is the most rigorous regime in the world, I think.’ However, some in Mr Davey’s party remain unconvinced that shale gas will provide the predicted energy revolution. A senior Lib Dem source told the Daily Mail: ‘There is no principled objection to shale gas. But all these Tories calling for it could be in for a rude awakening. 'Shale gas wells will generate a lot of traffic and disruption. It could make objections to onshore wind look like a picnic.’ Environmentalists fear a ‘dash for gas’ could also prevent Britain meeting its climate change targets. But Mr Davey said these would be met, despite resumption of fracking. He said: ‘Shale gas represents a promising new potential energy resource for the UK. It could contribute significantly to our energy security, reducing our reliance on imported gas.’ The new controls will include a ‘traffic light system’, requiring operators to stop if seismic activity reaches 0.5 on the Richter scale. An industry source said: ‘The new threshold is very conservative – it’s the equivalent of a large vehicle driving past on the road.’ Last year protestors attached themselves to the Cuadrilla shale gas exploration site near Hesketh Bank in Lancashire. So how serious are the environmental concerns? By David Derbyshire. Shale gas could become the greatest contribution to Britain’s energy supplies since the North Sea boom of the 1970s. But those against fracking say the environmental consequences outweigh the benefits. So what are those concerns and how serious are they? Earthquakes. Much has been made of the suspension of exploratory fracking at Blackpool last year after two small quakes of Richter scale magnitude 1.5 and 2.2 were recorded. The Cuadrilla drilling company said that its operations were probably responsible. But they were too minor to do any damage – and according to the British Geological Survey there were nine tremors in the UK of the same magnitude in the past two months alone. A follow-up study by the Department for Energy and Climate Change concluded that the risk of earthquakes caused by fracking was low, and structural damage to buildings, bridges and roads was extremely unlikely. POLLUTION. Millions of gallons of water and chemicals are forced into the ground during fracking operations, and there are concerns that some of the residue could leak into the water table. However, Parliament’s Energy Select Committee says there is little risk to water supplies in the UK, as long as the drilling is done correctly. Anger: Demonstrators hold placards in front of their mock fracking rig in protest outside the Houses of Parliament. Leaks. in America have been caused by badly maintained wells which haven’t. been lined properly. British supporters of shale gas development say. rules are tougher here. US. companies are also allowed to store dirty water from fracking wells in. open tanks, whereas in Britain fracking companies will have to store the. water in sealed containers on site. Concerns. have also been expressed about chemicals leaking from gas wells into. underground water aquifers and reaching the domestic supply. However,. most fracking is done thousands of feet deep – far below the water. table. Energy Secretary Ed Davey made a statement to Parliament on the Government's new policy on shale gas. US. protesters have complained about methane getting into their drinking. water. Again, the industry says this was caused by bad fracking. If. wells are lined, there is no reason why methane should escape. THREAT TO THE LANDSCAPE. The Department of Energy and Climate Change says nearly two thirds of Britain lies over shale gas reserves. If the predicted boom materialises, gas wells could spring up across the countryside. While they are not as imposing as wind farms, pylons or power stations, this would represent some industrialisation of rural Britain. Cuadrilla concedes that drilling and fracking rigs would be visible from a distance, but would be on site for only a few months. After that, they say wells could be screened from view. NUISANCE. Fleets of lorries will be needed to bring in excavation, drilling and storage equipment to create the well, and to bring the sand and chemicals for the fracking process. In the short term, shale gas would also be taken away by lorries, though it is cheaper to pipe it out. Over time, however, gas companies will almost certainly create a network of new gas pipes. THE BENEFITS. In America, fracking has slashed domestic gas prices and there could be similar major effects on household energy bills in the UK. David Cameron believes shale gas will eventually bring down prices here. Energy Secretary Ed Davey is a little more cautious, however, saying only that it will hold price increases down – but even that would be a relief to the long-suffering consumer. What is beyond doubt is that shale gas would reduce our reliance on imports, particularly those from Russia.The UK could also reduce reliance on piped gas from overseas by investing in desperately needed storage. In environmental terms, shale gas is deemed to be cleaner than coal and oil, though slightly less clean than North Sea gas. VIDEO: Energy Secretary Ed Davey says shale gas could play key role...

Attorneys who practice in this area often work for international organizations, such as the United Nations or the World Bank. Alternately, international lawyers can work for large firms on cross-border deals involving corporations in different countries. These kind of jobs are difficult to get. Even if you graduate law school and pass the bar, you very well might not be able to get one of these jobs.  Competition to get a job with an international non-governmental organization (NGO) will be fierce. There are very few international human rights jobs, period. In fact, breaking into this field is extremely challenging. Furthermore, most cross-border deals are done by large law firms, which are the most selective. You are expected to be near the top of your class and to have graduated from a selective law school in order to be hired at international law firms. Against your job prospects you also should weigh how you will finance your legal education. The cost of a legal education has exploded in the past decade. Students routinely pay over 30,000 a year in tuition alone, which does not include additional costs for living expenses. If you are not careful, you could graduate law school 200,000 in debt. CAS is used by all law schools. You send them your transcripts, letters of recommendation, and evaluation; they create a packet and send it to the law school. The service requires a fee. Register early and make sure to get your transcripts to CAS in a timely manner. Now is the time to draw on the relationships you have built up with faculty during your undergraduate career. Ask your professors if they can write you a strong letter of recommendation. Only follow through if that professor says “yes.”  If you didn't build strong relationships with faculty, don't despair. You can also ask for recommendations from present and past employers, as well as from people associated with church or volunteer organizations. Some recommenders may need to be prompted to complete the letter. Send a friendly email reminder, or stop in to chat. Law schools require that you write a short statement, typically on a topic of your choosing. The statement is usually only 500 words.  Follow the directions. If the school wants you to write on a specific topic, write on that topic. Also, if they give you a word limit, stick to the limit. Going over, by even a few words, can harm your chances of admission. Feel free to write about your interest in international law. You may want to write about your experience studying abroad. Whatever you write about, make sure that it is fresh, engaging, and memorable. You also should feel free to write about any subject that you want. You do not have to explain why you want to be a lawyer (unless the prompt specifies that you should write about that subject). An addendum can be a great way to explain something that looks bad in your application. A solid addendum will provide context for any information that might raise “red flags.”  Red flags include criminal convictions, punishment for cheating or plagiarism, or semesters with very low grades. An addendum might also clarify why one LSAT score is much higher than another. Remember to explain in your addendum, not make excuses.

Question: Question: \\"Where was Athanasius when he was targeted for arrest?\\"  Context: \\"Constantius, renewing his previous policies favoring the Arians, banished Athanasius from Alexandria once again. This was followed, in 356, by an attempt to arrest Athanasius during a vigil service. Athanasius fled to Upper Egypt, where he stayed in several monasteries and other houses. During this period, Athanasius completed his work Four Orations against the Arians and defended his own recent conduct in the Apology to Constantius and Apology for His Flight. Constantius's persistence in his opposition to Athanasius, combined with reports Athanasius received about the persecution of non-Arians by the new Arian bishop George of Laodicea, prompted Athanasius to write his more emotional History of the Arians, in which he described Constantius as a precursor of the Antichrist.\\"  Answer: Answer:","output":"Athanasius was in Alexandria, Egypt, when he was targeted for arrest by Constantius, who was the Roman Emperor at that time and a supporter of Arianism. This incident took place in 356 AD, during a vigil service that Athanasius was attending. In order to escape arrest, Athanasius fled to Upper Egypt, where he sought refuge in several monasteries and other safe houses during his time in exile. This attempt at arresting Athanasius was a result of Constantius renewing his policies in favor of Arianism, a theological school of thought that was considered heretical by the supporters of the orthodox Nicene Creed. Athanasius, a staunch defender of the Nicene Creed and a prominent figure in the fight against Arianism, became a prime target for Constantius and his Arian supporters. Consequently, Athanasius was banished from Alexandria multiple times due to the political and religious tensions that surrounded the issue of Arianism. Despite the difficulties and dangers he faced during this period of exile in Upper Egypt, Athanasius continued to be productive and engaged in intellectual and theological activities. He completed his work entitled Four Orations against the Arians, which was a comprehensive theological treatise against Arianism, and defended his own actions in two works: Apology to Constantius and Apology for His Flight. Furthermore, as mentioned in the context, the persistent opposition he faced from Constantius, as well as the information he received about the persecution of non-Arians by the Arian bishop George of Laodicea, led Athanasius to write the emotionally-charged History of the Arians. In this work, he portrayed Constantius as a precursor of the Antichrist, reflecting the deep conflict and animosity that existed between the supporters of Arianism and those upholding the Nicene Creed. In summary, when Athanasius was targeted for arrest in 356 AD, he was in Alexandria, attending a vigil service. He managed to escape and subsequently went into hiding in Upper Egypt, where he continued his theological activities and wrote crucial works against Arianism, further solidifying his position as a key figure in the defense of orthodox Christianity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The reason is… April 2, 2014 was the day my 53 year old wife found out that she had metastasized lung cancer. A large tumor had formed on the bottom of one lung, they found 4 tumors in her brain, another large one in her stomach and several more throughout her intestinal track. She rarely complained about physical problems and I knew something was wrong when she said she needed to go to the hospital ER. She died exactly 30 days later. I spent virtually every minute of that time with her. I went with her to radiation appointments. I stayed in the hospital with her because it seemed like every week I would have to take her in for something that required a 3 or 4 day stay. And the final trip to the ER was May 1st. An MRI showed that one of the tumors in her intestines had torn a hole in her bowel. The ER surgeon told us straight up that she was beyond any medical care that could help her and to use the next 24 hours to say goodbye to family and friends. And almost exactly 24 hours later, she was gone. I was devastated. 30.5 years of Happily Ever After turned into god fucking damn it all to hell!
