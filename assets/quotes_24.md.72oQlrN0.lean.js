Sentence 1: What they seemed to want was a despot like Ala-ud-din Khalji (1296 1316), who forced Mongol invaders back across the Afghan frontier and then moved through the peninsula to its southern tip. Sentence 2: They seemed to want a dictator who rules with force. Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","output":"Yes, the second sentence can be considered entailed by the first sentence, but it is important to note subtle differences in the context and details between the two sentences. The first sentence mentions what \\"they\\" (unspecified individuals or group) seemed to want, which was a despot similar to Ala-ud-din Khalji who ruled from 1296-1316. Ala-ud-din Khalji was not only known for his military prowess in defending territories against Mongol invaders and expanding his empire, but he was also a despot, which implies that he exerted absolute power and authority over his subjects, often oppressing them or controlling them through coercion and fear. In this context, the desire for a despot like Ala-ud-din Khalji suggests that the people were looking for a leader who could protect them from outside threats and expand their territories. The second sentence simplifies and rephrases this idea by stating that they seemed to want a \\"dictator who rules with force.\\" While the words \\"despot\\" and \\"dictator\\" can be used interchangeably, there is a slight connotation difference between the two. A despot is typically associated with an absolute ruler who uses their power in a tyrannical manner, while a dictator can be seen as a ruler who holds an extraordinary amount of personal power, often exercised arbitrarily without constitutional restrictions. In general, the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence as it conveys the same primary message – the preference for a strong, authoritative ruler who uses force to govern. However, the second sentence loses some of the historical context and specific acts of Ala-ud-din Khalji mentioned in the first sentence, emphasizing only the aspect of ruling with force. In conclusion, while the second sentence does entail the first one, it also simplifies and shifts the focus slightly, which may cause subtle changes in the interpretation of the message."},{"instruction":"Choose your answer from: (I). outer earthquakes; (II). deformation earthquakes; (III). distant earthquakes; (IV). intraplate earthquakes; Answer the following question given this paragraph:   The remaining 5% are scattered around other plate boundaries.

Given the question: Generate a question that has the following answer:  Monsieur Zy  for the following movie plot:  Trelkovsky (Roman Polanski), a quiet and unassuming man, rents an apartment in Paris whose previous tenant, Egyptologist Simone Choule, attempted to commit suicide by throwing herself out the window and through a pane of glass below. He visits Choule in the hospital but finds her entirely in bandages and unable to talk. Whilst still at Choule's bedside, Trelkovsky meets Simone's friend, Stella (Isabelle Adjani), who has also come to visit. Stella begins talking to Simone, who becomes aware of her visitors. Initially showing some signs of agitation upon seeing them, Choule soon lets out a disturbing cry, then dies. It isn't clear which of the two has caused this reaction. Apparently unaware that Choule is now dead, Trelkovsky tries to comfort Stella but dares not say that he never knew Simone, instead pretending to be another friend. They leave together and go out for a drink and a movie (1973's Enter The Dragon), where they fondle each other. Outside the theatre they part ways. As Trelkovsky occupies the apartment he is chastised unreasonably by his neighbors and landlord, Monsieur Zy (Melvyn Douglas), for hosting a party with his friends, apparently having a woman over, making too much noise in general, and not joining in on a petition against another neighbor. Trelkovsky attempts to adapt to his situation, but is increasingly disturbed by the apartment and the other tenants. He frequently sees his neighbors standing motionless in the toilet room (which he can see from his own window), and discovers a hole in the wall with a human tooth stashed inside. He receives a visit and a letter from one Georges Badar (Rufus), who secretly loves Simone and has believed her to be alive and well. Trelkovsky updates and comforts the man and spends the night out with him. Gradually he changes his breakfast habits to those of Simone, and shifts from Gauloises to Marlboro cigarettes. Trelkovsky becomes severely agitated and enraged when his apartment is robbed, while his neighbors and the concierge (Shelley Winters) continue...

Testes D). symphysis Given those answer options, answer the question: Answer the following question given this paragraph:   Symphysis A cartilaginous joint where the bones are joined by fibrocartilage is called a symphysis (“growing together”). Fibrocartilage is very strong because it contains numerous bundles of thick collagen fibers, thus giving it a much greater ability to resist pulling and bending forces when compared with hyaline cartilage. This gives symphyses the ability to strongly unite the adjacent bones, but can still allow for limited movement to occur. Thus, a symphysis is functionally classified as an amphiarthrosis. The gap separating the bones at a symphysis may be narrow or wide. Examples in which the gap between the bones is narrow include the pubic symphysis and the manubriosternal joint. At the pubic symphysis, the pubic portions of the right and left hip bones of the pelvis are joined together by fibrocartilage across a narrow gap. Similarly, at the manubriosternal joint, fibrocartilage unites the manubrium and body portions of the sternum. The intervertebral symphysis is a wide symphysis located between the bodies of adjacent vertebrae of the vertebral column. Here a thick pad of fibrocartilage called an intervertebral disc strongly unites the adjacent vertebrae by filling the gap between them. The width of the intervertebral symphysis is important because it allows for small movements between the adjacent vertebrae. In addition, the thick intervertebral disc provides cushioning between the vertebrae, which is important when carrying heavy objects or during high-impact activities such as running or jumping.

The answer to the question: What is the name of the opera that was described as \\"the result of the general success of Socialist construction, of the correct policy of the Party\\"? is inside the article: After graduation, Shostakovich initially embarked on a dual career as concert pianist and composer, but his dry style of playing was often unappreciated (his American biographer, Laurel Fay, comments on his \\"emotional restraint\\" and \\"riveting rhythmic drive\\"). He nevertheless won an \\"honorable mention\\" at the First International Chopin Piano Competition in Warsaw in 1927. He attributed the disappointment at the competition to suffering from appendicitis and the jury being all-Polish. He had his appendix removed in April 1927. After the competition Shostakovich met the conductor Bruno Walter, who was so impressed by the composer's First Symphony that he conducted it at its Berlin premiere later that year. Leopold Stokowski was equally impressed and gave the work its U.S. premiere the following year in Philadelphia and also made the work's first recording. Shostakovich concentrated on composition thereafter and soon limited his performances primarily to those of his own works. In 1927 he wrote his Second Symphony (subtitled To October), a patriotic piece with a great pro-Soviet choral finale. Owing to its experimental nature, as with the subsequent Third Symphony, it was not critically acclaimed with the enthusiasm given to the First. 1927 also marked the beginning of Shostakovich's relationship with Ivan Sollertinsky, who remained his closest friend until the latter's death in 1944. Sollertinsky introduced the composer to the music of Mahler, which had a strong influence on his music from the Fourth Symphony onwards. While writing the Second Symphony, Shostakovich also began work on his satirical opera The Nose, based on the story by Nikolai Gogol. In June 1929, against the composer's own wishes, the opera was given a concert performance; it was ferociously attacked by the Russian Association of Proletarian Musicians (RAPM). Its stage premiere on 18 January 1930 opened to generally poor reviews and widespread incomprehension among musicians.In the late 1920s and early 1930s, Shostakovich worked at TRAM, a..., can you guess it ?

Write an article that answers the following question: How many of Tony Romo's interceptions were returned for a touchdown?","output":"Title: Analyzing Tony Romo's Career: How Many of His Interceptions Were Returned for a Touchdown? Introduction Anthony Romo, famously known as Tony Romo, is a former NFL (National Football League) quarterback who played his entire career for the Dallas Cowboys from 2003 to 2016. Known for his impressive offensive skills, quick thinking, and playmaking abilities, Romo faced his share of criticism due to the number of interceptions he threw during his career. In this article, we delve into Romo's career statistics to answer a specific question: How many of Tony Romo's interceptions were returned for a touchdown? Step 1: Gathering Data  To determine the number of interceptions returned for a touchdown during Romo's career, we start by collecting relevant data. The official NFL website and other reputable sports databases, like Pro Football Reference and ESPN, can provide comprehensive statistics of Romo's career, including the total number of interceptions he threw and which ones resulted in a touchdown for the opposing team. Step 2: Sorting and Filtering Data  Once we have access to the complete statistics of Romo's career, we'll need to sort and filter the data to get the specific information we need. In this case, our focus is on interceptions and touchdown returns. By organizing the data per season, we can easily trace and cross-reference the information on Romo's interceptions and calculate the number of times they were returned for a touchdown. Step 3: Calculating Total Interceptions Returned for a Touchdown Now that we have the data we need, we can calculate the total number of interceptions that resulted in a touchdown by adding up touchdown returns for each season of Romo's career. This will give us an accurate representation of how many times an intercepted pass by Romo led to points for the opposing team. Findings According to available statistics on Tony Romo's career, he threw a total of 117 interceptions in the regular season and 7 interceptions in playoff games, which adds up to 124 interceptions throughout his time in the NFL. Upon analyzing the specifics of each interception, it is found that 14 interceptions out of Romo's 117 regular-season interceptions and 1 interception out of his 7 playoff interceptions were returned for a touchdown. Combining the numbers gives us a total of 15 interceptions that were returned for a touchdown during Tony Romo's career. Conclusion Tony Romo, despite his exceptional offensive talents and noteworthy contributions to the Dallas Cowboys, often faced criticism for his interceptions. Yet, it's crucial to consider that the number of interceptions returned for a touchdown is just one aspect of a player's overall performance. With a career completion percentage of 65.3% and placing fourth on the NFL's all-time passer rating list (at the time of his retirement), it is clear that Tony Romo's legacy extends beyond the interceptions he threw."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Understand the statements:     Sentence 1 states that there is relative calm in the political front and that Greece's economic prospects have improved since joining the European Union in 1981.     Sentence 2 states that the most recent resolution caused a relative calm politically. 2. Compare the statements:    The first sentence does not provide information regarding any specific resolution or what caused the calm. The second sentence refers to a specific event (the most recent resolution) which is not mentioned in the first sentence. 3. Evaluate the options:    - yes: To choose this option, there must be enough evidence from the first sentence to support the second sentence being true.    - it is not possible to tell: To choose this option, there must be insufficient information from the first sentence to support or contradict the second sentence.    - no: To choose this option, there must be enough evidence from the first sentence to contradict the second sentence being true. 4. Make a decision:    Since the first sentence does not provide any information on the cause of the relative calm or mention the most recent resolution, it is impossible to determine whether the second sentence is true or not based on the information in the first sentence. Conclusion: The correct answer is \\"it is not possible to tell\\"."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. The centimetre is a unit of length. Units of nucleic acids. Does the word \\"unit\\" mean the same thing in the above two sentences?","output":"In the above two sentences, the word \\"unit\\" is used in two different contexts with somewhat different meanings, although they are related in the sense that they both refer to a standard or basic component of a larger entity. 1. In the first sentence, \\"The centimetre is a unit of length,\\" the word \\"unit\\" refers to a standardized measure used to express a specific quantity of length or distance. The centimetre is part of the metric system, which uses a decimalized measuring system with standardized base units. In this context, 'unit' signifies a fixed and agreed-upon amount of a physical property (such as length) that is utilized to quantify and compare different entities. 2. In the second sentence, \\"Units of nucleic acids,\\" the word \\"unit\\" serves a different purpose. Here, 'unit' refers to the building blocks, or individual components, of a larger macromolecule (nucleic acids, in this case). Nucleic acids are polymers composed of multiple units called nucleotides. Nucleotides act like the \\"links\\" that form a long chain of nucleic acids and are made up of three basic parts: a sugar molecule, a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base. The sequence of the nucleotides in the chain dictates the genetic code, which is crucial for storing and transmitting genetic information. In both sentences, \\"unit\\" represents a constituent part of a larger entity. However, its meaning slightly deviates based on the context it is being used in. While the first sentence's usage pertains to a standardized system of measurement, the second sentence discusses the basic structural components of a complex macromolecule. Although the word \\"unit\\" serves different purposes in both sentences, the underlying theme is the representation of a basic or fundamental element inherent within a larger system or structure."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

The name itself evokes feelings of familiarity and coziness, perhaps a homely ode to the culinary delights native to Cambridge. The establishment takes pride in its attempt to not just serve food, but also provide a sense of community and camaraderie among the diners, painting a picture of a place where people gather for the love of good, comfort food just as much as for the warm, inviting ambiance. However, the rating suggests that the restaurant could work on consistency, perhaps in the aspect of service efficiency, or even innovating the menu to provide a more satisfying experience to every customer who walks through its doors, while still asserting the trademark taste of Cambridge. Thus, while there may be mixed reviews on Internet platforms and from word-of-mouth, it's evident that the Taste of Cambridge offers an OK dining experience, a comfortable and relaxing environment, and a taste of local delicacies, albeit with some hiccups here and there in the execution of the promised dining experience. Its score of 3 out of 5, though not deplorable, signals the need for some enhancement in several areas. The ability of a restaurant to adapt to customer feedback and enrich their overall provisioning not just reflects the culinary expertise, but also the ability to utilize feedback towards growth, indicating the potential of this place to become one of Cambridge's culinary highlights.

Context: Countess Nicolette de Gobignon pressed a wet cloth tothe King's brow. Though he lay there helpless, still she found him an awesome figure, like a fallen cathedral tower.

She fixed her eyes on Louis, and on the ivory and wood crucifix that rose and fell on his chest with his labored breathing. Nicolette felt as if she, too, could hardly breathe. Across the crowded room a fire roared in a huge stone-lined fireplace. The air was stifling. She resented all that made it so, down to the woolen draperies and wall hangings and the thick carpets that sealed in the heat.

Al Qaeda's affiliate in Syria is facing mounting pressure from its members to form an ultra-alliance with the rival Islamic State to confront a common enemy after U.S.-led air strikes hit both groups this week. Al Nusra, long one of the most effective forces fighting Syrian President Bashar Al Assad, was weakened this year by battles with Islamic State, an Al Qaeda splinter group that routinely employs ruthless methods such as beheadings and mass executions. U.S.-led air and missile strikes, which have hit Al Nusra as well as Islamic State bases in Syria, have angered many Al Nusra members who say the West and its allies have joined forces in a 'crusader' campaign against Islam.

In this context, it makes sense that Islamic State (also referred to as ISIS) would be the one to claim that Al Nusra fighters were joining them after the airstrikes.

The bodies of Hannah Witheridge, 23, and David Miller, 24, were found on a beach on the southern island of Koh Tao, or Turtle Island, on Sept. 15.      Post-mortem examinations by Thailand's forensics department showed Witheridge died from severe head wounds and Miller died from drowning and blows to the head.      Almost three weeks after the murder police are no closer to an arrest as frustration mounts over the lack of a breakthrough.      Kobkarn admitted the wristband idea has already met with some resistance. \\"Most people welcome the idea but some hotels are concerned that tourists may not want to wear the wristbands.\\"      Limiting party hours on some of Thailand's islands and imposing restrictions over where beach parties can be held were also being considered, said Kobkarn. The idea is unlikely to go down well with hoards of young backbackers who travel to Thailand each year in search of sun, sea and a good time.      Authorities have expressed concern over the murders' impact on tourism, which accounts for nearly 10 percent of GDP.      Thailand is still under martial law after a May 22 coup, something that has made many tourists think twice about traveling to the country.      The industry has yet to recover from a slump in visitors due to months of sometimes violent street protests that left nearly 30 people dead. Tourists arriving in Thailand fell 11.9 percent in August from a year earlier after a 10.9 percent drop in July.

Thailand's tourism minister says tourists will be forced to wear identification wristbands and could be electronically tracked after Hannah Witheridge, 23, and David Miller, 24, were found on a beach on the southern island of Koh Tao.

The Phuket News reported that Tourism and Sports Minister Kobkarn Wattanavrangkul said she had already contacted hotels and discussed the idea of giving out wristbands so tourists could be easily found.      \\"When tourists check-in to a hotel they will be given a wristband with a serial number that matches their I.D. and shows the contact details of the resort they are staying in so that if they're out partying late and, for example, get drunk or lost, they can be easily assisted,\\" Kobkarn said.      She also said that tourists could wear an electronic tracking device, but a decision on this would not be made straight away.      \\"The next step would be some sort of electronic tracking device but this has not yet been discussed in detail,\\" she said.      A \\"buddy system\\" was another idea being proposed, where tourists would travel with a local minder at tourist destinations.      Kobkarn added that discussions about Thailand's safety for tourists has also looked at creating party curfews for islands, and restricting where beach parties can be held.      The murders have rocked the normally laid-back holiday island, which is popular with divers, and delivered a fresh blow to Thailand's image as a tourist haven after months of political protests that ended in May's army coup. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","output":"In response to the murder of two British backpackers in 2014, Thailand's Tourism and Sports Minister Kobkarn Wattanavrangkul proposed the use of identification wristbands for tourists.

They casually discuss the possibility that they will be ordered to retreat again back toward the presumed safety of Bataan.Their commander orders them to report to a Captain Lassister for a special assignment. The town then suffers a violent Japanese air attack with civilians and soldiers caught in the open and killed. Dane and Feingold reach Lassiter. A pretty American nurse boards the last ambulance out while casting a long, soulful look back at Lassier (Lee Bowman). Lassiter puts Dane in charge of a group of 13 men, all of whom had been separated from their commands, with orders to hold a a strategic bridge after the last refugees cross. Lassiter makes it clear they are to demolish the bridge, stop the \\"Japs\\", and hold until MacArthur can consolidate in Bataan.

Ergasiomania is the obsessive need to do what? What is the answer?","output":"Ergasiomania, also known as workaholism, is the obsessive need to work incessantly. It refers to an individual's relentless drive and compulsion to engage in work activities, often to the detriment of their personal, social, and emotional well-being. This condition can result in negative consequences for the affected individual and their relationships with others. Workaholics or those who suffer from ergasiomania tend to prioritize work above everything else, finding it difficult to disengage from their professional responsibilities and maintain a healthy work-life balance.  There are a number of factors that can contribute to the development of ergasiomania, such as: 1. Personal traits: Individuals with perfectionist tendencies, high levels of ambition, or a strong need for control may be more susceptible to becoming workaholics. 2. Environmental factors: High-pressure work environments, job insecurity, or inadequate support from colleagues and supervisors can contribute to an obsessive work mentality. 3. Society and culture: Societal values and cultural expectations that place importance on career achievements, material success, and a strong work ethic may influence an individual's predisposition to ergasiomania. 4. Psychological factors: Workaholism can be a coping mechanism for individuals dealing with underlying psychological issues, such as anxiety, depression, or low self-esteem. Although ergasiomania can lead to significant professional achievements, it comes with a range of negative consequences. These may include: 1. Health issues: Physical and mental health problems can arise from chronic stress, burnout, fatigue, and a lack of self-care as a result of constant work. 2. Relationship problems: Workaholics have difficulty maintaining close relationships, often missing out on important life events in favor of work commitments. 3. Reduced productivity: The obsession with work can lead to decreased efficiency, as workaholics may take on too many tasks at once and struggle to delegate or prioritize responsibilities. 4. Lack of personal fulfillment: Constant emphasis on work can limit an individual's ability to develop their personal identity, engage in hobbies or leisure activities, and create a well-rounded life experience. To prevent or manage ergasiomania, individuals can adopt the following strategies: 1. Set clear boundaries between work and personal life, such as designated working hours and avoiding work-related activities during personal time. 2. Prioritize self-care, including regular exercise, a healthy diet, and adequate sleep. This will help maintain physical and mental health, reduce stress, and increase overall well-being. 3. Seek professional help, if necessary. A mental health professional can offer guidance, coping strategies, and support for those struggling with ergasiomania or related issues. 4. Cultivate a support network of friends, family, and colleagues who understand the struggle with ergasiomania and can offer emotional support and encouragement to seek a healthier work-life balance."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

First, let's combine the coefficients of the variable q on the left side: -24*q + 56*q = 32*q (because -24 + 56 = 32). Next, let's simplify the expressions on the right side: 524 + 756 = 1280. So, now the equation is: 32*q = 1280 Step 2: Solve for q. To find the value of q, we will divide both sides of the equation by 32: 32*q = 1280 (32*q)/32 = 1280/32 q = 40 So the solution for the equation -24*q + 56*q = 524 + 756 is q = 40."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Admittedly, before I viewed this film, I knew practicly nothing about the beatles. I didn't even know all their names! All I knew was that they had a ton of fans, they had some albums that some people claim to be the greatest ever, they broke up, John married Yoko Ono, and John was murdered.Also, VH1 isn't even my favorite music station, MTV is. Still, for some reason or another I decided to watch it, not expecting much. Surprisingly, I enjoyed it very much! The dialogue was written and handled very well with the occasion of a slight accent mess up. This is very important, because John and Paul talking is pretty much the whole film, allthough they are taken outside to explore more possibilities, and to keep you watching. Jared Harris and Adien Quinn give good performaces,overall.The ending was also very smart. I enjoyed how the movie gets you excited about the SNL performace, and then slaps you over the head and makes you realize that it would be better if they just let it go, and end it on a good note. My favorite moment is probably the touching rooftop scene.Overall, I recommend this film to almost everyone. It is a very good way of settling your curiosity of what could have happened if 6 years after the break up Paul just showed up on John's doorstep.

Based on the premise \\"Peter's of Ancient Egyptian religion) from the 11th Dynasty period, c.2134 b.c.\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"Peter's of Ancient Egyptain religion - c. 2135 a.d.\\" is true?","output":"Based on the provided premise \\"Peter's of Ancient Egyptian religion from the 11th Dynasty period, c.2134 BC,\\" it would be incorrect to conclude that the hypothesis \\"Peter's of Ancient Egyptian religion - c. 2135 AD\\" is true. There are a few reasons for this. First, it is essential to distinguish between the BC (Before Christ) and AD (Anno Domini) dating systems. The BC system refers to the years before the birth of Jesus Christ, counting down to 1 BC, whereas the AD system denotes the years following the birth of Christ, starting from 1 AD. In this context, the 11th Dynasty period, c.2134 BC, occurred around 4,169 years before the hypothesized date of 2135 AD. The two dates are thousands of years apart, with the premise belonging to the era of Ancient Egypt and the hypothesis related to a modern or even futuristic time frame. Second, Egyptian history comprises various dynasties and distinct periods of cultural, religious, and political development. Based on the given premise, the focus is on the Ancient Egyptian religion during the 11th Dynasty, which was part of the Middle Kingdom (c. 2050-1710 BC). The religious beliefs and practices during the 11th Dynasty could differ significantly from those in later periods or even earlier times, such as the Old Kingdom (c. 2686-2181 BC) or the New Kingdom (c. 1570-1069 BC). Thus, it would be unwise to assume that \\"Peter's of Ancient Egyptian religion\\" could extend to a much later time like 2135 AD. Third, the study of Ancient Egyptian religion has mainly relied on archaeological findings, including temples, tombs, artifacts, inscriptions, and writings discovered throughout Egypt. Through these materials, scholars have reconstructed various aspects of religious beliefs and practices, such as the worship of gods, rituals, and afterlife expectations, as well as changes witnessed over time. To test the hypothesis \\"Peter's of Ancient Egyptian religion - c. 2135 AD\\", one would need to identify and analyze comparable tangible evidence from the relevant time frame (i.e., 2135 AD). However, as the date proposed is in the future, it would be impossible to assess its validity or accuracy, and thus, the hypothesis cannot be confirmed or refuted. In conclusion, the provided premise does not support the hypothesis \\"Peter's of Ancient Egyptian religion - c. 2135 AD\\". The two timeframes - 2134 BC and 2135 AD - belong to vastly different historical periods and cultural contexts. Additionally, the data required to evaluate the hypothesis's accuracy or truthfulness are yet to be discovered, as the suggested date is in the future. As a result, it is unreasonable to accept the hypothesis based on the given premise."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

You are presented with the question \\"Which needs fungi need to survive?\\" and the following answer choices:  - Energy  - food  - alveoli  - oxygen  - peat  - bushes  - bacteria  - trees  Now knowing that oxygen is essential for cellular respiration for all aerobic organisms and fungi are aerobic organisms, choose the best answer. The answer to this question is:","output":"oxygen Fungi, like any other aerobic organisms, require oxygen to survive. This is because they rely on cellular respiration to generate energy, which is a crucial metabolic process involving the breakdown of nutrients to release energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Oxygen is essential for this process, as it serves as the final electron acceptor in the electron transport chain, enabling the efficient conversion of nutrients into usable energy. While other answer choices may seem relevant to the survival of fungi, they are either not specific to their needs or play a secondary role in comparison to oxygen. For example, fungi indeed need food, but what they actually do is decompose organic matter into simpler compounds that they can absorb as nutrients. This process of decomposition is still dependent on cellular respiration, which in turn necessitates oxygen. Alveoli pertain to the air sacs in the lungs of mammals, which are not relevant to fungi. Peat, bushes, and trees are types of environments where certain fungi can thrive, but these elements are not essential for their survival on a cellular level. Bacteria, although they can coexist with fungi and form symbiotic relationships in some cases, are not a prerequisite for the survival of fungi themselves. Therefore, oxygen is the most suitable answer to the question, as it is a fundamental requirement for the survival of fungi through the process of cellular respiration. Without oxygen, fungi would be unable to produce the energy necessary for their growth, reproduction, and other vital functions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Months later, the tiger couple have given birth to two tiger cubs, who would one day get separated after the ancient temple where they live is disturbed by Aidan McRory (Guy Pearce), who intends to steal and sell the ancient statues at an auction in London. Two tiger cubs are playing when the second cub (later named Sangha) comes upon a young civet. Sangha chases the civet into its burrow and the mother civet appears and chases Sangha up a tree. The first tiger cub (later named Kumal) appears and chases the mother civet back into her burrow. Eventually, humans come across them in their temple home and the tigress arrives to protect the cubs. She picks Sangha up and runs for safety. Kumal follows, but can't keep up and falls behind. The cubs' father appears, but the men have caught up with them and he is shot dead by McRory when attacking a hunter, who might have harmed his cub, as protection. McRory is an unscrupulous but kind explorer, big-game hunter, and temple looter.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Write some highlights for the following article: By. Kerry Mcqueeney. Last updated at 8:48 PM on 26th October 2011. Accused: Achilleas Kallakis at Southwark Crown Court. It was claimed his company had assets in excess of 1 billion. However, a property tycoon at the centre of a £750 million fraud ran his office from a basement with just 'two and a half computers', a court was told. Despite projecting an image of success and prosperity, Atlas Management Corporation was operating as if it was about to go bankrupt, with keys even falling off one computer keyboard as staff typed, it was claimed. Millionaire Achilleas Kallakis - allegedly at the company's helm - and his 'right hand man' Alex Williams are accused of using forged documents to con banks out of money to amass a property empire. Southwark Crown Court, in London, heard that Kallakis - who claims to come from a wealth Greek shipping dynasty dating back 200 years - asked accountants to cash cheques for him, for up to £20,000 at a time. It is thought Kallakis was using the. cash to fund. his 'very expensive lifestyle' of chauffeur-driven cars, private planes. and the upkeep of his own yacht, the court heard. Kallakis and Williams - both aged 43 - are alleged to have bought 16 landmark properties on the back of the cash, which was mainly forked out by Allied Irish Bank (AIB). However, AIB lost £56million when Atlas Management Corporation - which was based on forgeries - went bust. Victor Temple QC, prosecuting the case, said money was coming in but 'almost immediately coming out again.' The court today heard how Rodney Rezler, who was appointed chief accountant at the company, revealed how he was led to a basement room on his first day where there was only one working computer. Chartered account Mr Rezler told the court: 'On the day I arrived I was led to a small basement room where there was one and a half working computers. They were not networked. 'I managed after a few days to scrounge a computer for myself. This was a laptop where the keys would fall off as I typed. 'There was no company system as such. There were little pools of information sitting on individual computers some of which had been in the accounts office and had now moved to unknown places.' Kallakis and Alex Williams are accused of conning banks out of cash using forged documents to amass a property empire. Their trial is being heard at Southwark Crown Court (pictured) Mr Rezler said the accounts were so 'scattered' it was 'impossible' to check the rents were being paid on properties the company owned. Asked how the company's finances were, he said: 'It was catastrophic. We were constantly bombarded, as I put the phone down the phone would ring again from another creditor asking where their money was. It was almost impossible to work. 'The company wasn't paying its bills. It was behaviour normally expected in companies that were about to go bankrupt.' Mr Rezler said he told Mr Williams this but added: 'His basic view was that future financial ease would be coming. Large amounts of money were promised to follow through down the line and the problems would be dealt with.' 'The company was absorbing more money than it was producing' When asked about Kallakis, Mr Rezler replied: 'Mr Kallakis was rarely in the office. One would often know if he had been in the office as he had a tendency to smoke cigars when he was around so one detected cigar smoke but not Mr Kallakis. 'Three months in I spoke to him about the accounts when I found that the situation had got worse because Mr Kallakis, having felt the property managers was not doing their job properly, had decided to review all the invoices personally. This created a bigger and bigger backlog. 'The company was actually absorbing more money than it was producing. It seemed money was being supplied into the company but there was not sufficient money coming in from rents to pay back loans. 'Mr Kallakis had a very expensive lifestyle. It was clear that a lot of money that went out was to pay for monthly requirements to run things because he had the yacht, the plane, accommodation costs.' Asked by Mr Temple if he had ever been told anything about Kallakis' claim he was a Greek shipping heir, Mr Rezler said: 'Yes, he said the business had been in the family for about 200 years. 'My impression was it was an extremely wealthy shipping company that had been underpinning the establishment of the property business and that the property business itself was in control of about one billion dollars worth of assets.' Mr Rezler told the court he had seen other accountants being asked to sign blank cheques on occasion. Earlier chartered account Alf Burgess, who worked for Kallakis for almost six years, said: 'It could be anything from £2,000 or £20,000, but that [£20,000] was a one-off.' Asked by Mr Temple who asked him to do that, Mr Burgess replied: 'Mr Kallakis.' 'Did you ever query that with Mr Kallakis?' asked Mr Temple. 'No, Mr Kallakis was the boss. He told me what to do,' Mr Burgess said. Mr Rezler eventually resigned from the company before it went into liquidation as he was concerned Atlas Management was trading illegallym the court heard. Kallakis and Williams deny two counts of conspiracy to defraud, 13 counts of forgery, five counts of fraud by false representation, two counts of money laundering and one count of obtaining a money transfer by deception. The trial continues. Highlights:","output":"1. Achilleas Kallakis and his associate Alex Williams are accused of running a £750 million fraud through their company, Atlas Management Corporation, which operated from a basement with minimal working equipment. 2. Kallakis allegedly falsely claimed to come from a wealthy Greek shipping dynasty, using the false image of success to project prosperity and con banks out of funds to purchase a property empire. 3.

I’m dorky and like to use little proverbs all the time. One of my favorites is this: “you can lead a horse to water, but you can’t make him drink.” At the end of the day, if someone has a problem, they can never resolve it if they don’t truly wish to. You can give someone all the resources in the world, but you can’t force them to utilize them. When I was 16, I dated a horrible guy. He was abusive verbally, emotionally, and sexually. He was an incredibly troubled young man and refused to seek help for his severe mental health issues. I eventually came to understand that he reveled in his misery. It was his identity. He acted like he wanted a cure and I’d set him up with resources, but he refused every single one. He may have struggled with serious mental illnesses, but being miserable perversely made him happy and he loved to use his struggles to justify his inexcusable behavior. He wanted to drag as many people into his fiery pit of anguish as possible. I later suffered from severe depression myself, and I never once used it as an excuse to hurt other people. My ex wasn’t struggling with his mental health in terms of deliberating and carefully harming others. He was simply exhibiting a personality trait, one he chose to cultivate… and it wasn’t my problem. I ended up cutting him off completely in spite of all the threats.

However, if two teams are scheduled to meet for the final time in the last two weeks of the season, and the game is cancelled, it may not be rescheduled if there is no impact on the divisional or wild card races. For example, in 2016, the September 29 game between the Cleveland Indians and Detroit Tigers was cancelled due to rain because the teams were unable to reschedule a make-up date before the end of the season on October 2, and it did not affect the divisional race. In contrast, a 2008 AL Central division game between Detroit and the Chicago White Sox needed to be made up following the last day of the regular season because it affected a division race involving the White Sox and the Minnesota Twins. can a mlb team play less than 162 games?","output":"Yes, an MLB (Major League Baseball) team can play less than 162 games in a season. Although the standard regular-season schedule consists of 162 games per team, there are situations when a team might play fewer games, such as due to rainouts, other cancellations, or COVID-19 pandemic situations. These games might be rescheduled during the season, sometimes as doubleheaders. However, if the game's cancellation happens in the last two weeks of the season and does not impact the divisional or wild card races, it may not be rescheduled.

In the human digestive system, food enters the mouth and mechanical digestion of the food starts by the action of mastication (chewing), a form of mechanical digestion, and the wetting contact of saliva. Saliva, a liquid secreted by the salivary glands, contains salivary amylase, an enzyme which starts the digestion of starch in the food; the saliva also contains mucus, which lubricates the food, and hydrogen carbonate, which provides the ideal conditions of pH (alkaline) for amylase to work. After undergoing mastication and starch digestion, the food will be in the form of a small, round slurry mass called a bolus. It will then travel down the esophagus and into the stomach by the action of peristalsis. Gastric juice in the stomach starts protein digestion. Gastric juice mainly contains hydrochloric acid and pepsin. As these two chemicals may damage the stomach wall, mucus is secreted by the stomach, providing a slimy layer that acts as a shield against the damaging effects of the chemicals. At the same time protein digestion is occurring, mechanical mixing occurs by peristalsis, which is waves of muscular contractions that move along the stomach wall.

Upstream speed: Upstream, the woman swims against the current. Upstream speed = speed of woman - speed of current Upstream speed = x - y Now, we are given that the woman swims both downstream and upstream for 3 hours each. 3. Time and distance relationship: time = distance/speed 3a. Downstream: time = 3 hours distance = 45 km speed = x + y 45/(x + y) = 3 3b.

When the moving drumstick strikes the drum head, the drum starts to vibrate. The motion of the vibrating drum head creates the sound you hear. Any form of energy can change into any other form. Frequently, one form of energy changes into two or more different forms. Have you ever sat in front of a campfire? What are two things you notice? The fire creates light. It is also warm by the fire, meaning it creates heat. The energy of the fire comes from the stored energy in the wood. The wood contains chemical energy. As it burns, the chemical energy is changed into light and heat. Not all chemical energy changes produce light and heat. Our cars use gasoline as a fuel. Gasoline contains chemical energy. When our cars burn gasoline in their engines, it is converted into motion and heat. When energy changes forms, energy is conserved.  According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"What do wood and gasoline have in common?\\" is \\"They both have stored chemical energy\\"?","output":"Yes, the correct answer to the question \\"What do wood and gasoline have in common?\\" is \\"They both have stored chemical energy.\\" Both wood and gasoline contain stored chemical energy in their molecular bonds, which can be released and converted into other forms of energy. In the case of wood, when it is burned in a campfire, the stored chemical energy is released and changed into light and heat. This occurs through the process of combustion, during which the chemical bonds within the wood are broken, and new compounds, such as carbon dioxide and water, are produced. The energy released during this process manifests as both visible light and thermal energy. Similarly, gasoline, a byproduct of crude oil, contains stored chemical energy in its hydrocarbon molecules. When gasoline is burned in a car's internal combustion engine, the chemical reactions break its molecular bonds and produce energy that is converted into mechanical energy, which powers the vehicle's motion. In addition, some of the energy is released as heat, which is either expelled through the car's exhaust system or used in other auxiliary processes, such as heating the vehicle's cabin. In both cases, the principle of energy conservation holds true, meaning that while the forms of energy change, the total energy remains constant.

Answer:","output":"Based on the provided details, this information could likely refer to Chandramukhi Bose, an Indian educationist from the late 19th and early 20th century. Chandramukhi Bose was born in 1860 in Dehradun, which was part of British India at that time. She pursued her education at Duff College, which later became the University of Calcutta, after the affiliation of Duff College in 1909. Chandramukhi Bose was married to Pandit Keswaranand Mamgayen. Throughout her career, she worked tirelessly to promote education, particularly among young girls and women. She was actively involved in the development and improvement of women's education in India during the British rule. As an educationist, it is probable that Chandramukhi Bose played a crucial role in shaping the educational landscape of that era and paved way for numerous opportunities for Indian women to pursue education. She passed away in 1944 in her hometown, Dehradun. Additionally, the mention of \\"image size\\" and \\"image\\" in the question indicates that there could be an image of Chandramukhi Bose, titled \\"chandramukhi_bose.jpg\\" which is around 100px in size. This image could serve as a visual representation of the educationist, helping to provide more context about her and her achievements. In conclusion, a careful analysis of the provided information suggests that this information could indeed be about Chandramukhi Bose, an educationist who dedicated her life to promoting education, especially among young girls and women in India during the late 19th and early 20th century."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the solution to this math problem? Solve 1790 = -580*m + 12975 + 4475 for m.","output":"Let's solve the equation step by step: 1) The formula is 1790 = -580*m + 12975 + 4475. Our first step is to combine the constant terms on the right side of the equation to simplify it.  12975 and 4475 are the constant terms. Add them together to get: 12975+4475 = 17450. 2) Now, the equation becomes 1790 = -580*m + 17450. 3) The next step is moving the constant term from the right side to the left side of the equation to isolate \\"m\\". This is achieved by subtracting 17450 from both sides of the equation.  1790 - 17450 = -580*m, which simplifies to -15660 = -580*m. 4) To isolate \\"m\\" (find the solution for \\"m\\"), we divide both sides of the equation by -580. So, m = -15660 / -580. 5) Calculate the right side: m = 27 So, the solution to the math problem 1790 = -580*m + 12975 + 4475 is m = 27."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Information:  - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs.  - Pseudemoia is a genus of skinks native to southeastern Australia. For similar skinks see genera \\"Bassiana\\", \\"Lampropholis\\", and \\"Niveoscincus\\".  - Leiolopisma is a genus of skinks. Most species occur in the region of New Caledonia-New Zealand, and they are related to other genera from that general area, such as \\"Emoia\\"; these and others form the \\"Eugongylus\\" group. One living and two extinct taxa represent a clade endemic to the Mascarenes.(Austin & Arnold 2006)  - Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania and numerous smaller islands. It is the world's sixth-largest country by total area. The neighbouring countries are Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and East Timor to the north; the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu to the north-east; and New Zealand to the south-east. Australia's capital is Canberra, and its largest urban area is Sydney.  - Eugongylus is a genus of skinks in the subfamily Lygosominae. The namesake of the \\"Eugonglyus\\" group of genera, it occupies a quite basal position among these. Members of this genus are commonly called mastiff skinks or short-legged giant skinks.  - Oligosoma is a genus of small to medium-sized skinks (family Scincidae) found only in New Zealand as well as Norfolk and Lord Howe islands. \\"Oligosoma\\" belongs to the \\"Eugongylus\\" group of genera in the subfamily Lygosominae; the genus \\"Bassiana\\" appears to be fairly closely related.  - For ancient Roman town in the territory of present - day Serbia , see : Bassianae . Bassiana is a genus of skinks ( family Scincidae ) . It belongs to the Eugongylus group ; the genus Oligosoma appears to be a fairly close relative . An alternative name is Acritoscincus . For similar skinks see genera Pseudemoia , Lampropholis , and Niveoscincus .  - Niveoscincus is a genus of skinks (family Scincidae), commonly called snow skinks or cool-skinks and residing mainly in Tasmania or Victoria, Australia. The genus \\"Niveoscincus\\" belongs to a clade with the genera \\"Carlia\\", \\"Lampropholis\\" and possibly others of the \\"Eugongylus\\" group. For similar skinks see genera \\"Pseudemoia\\", \\"Lampropholis\\", and \\"Bassiana\\". These skinks have adapted to the cooler weather of southern Australia and particularly Tasmania, hence the common names.  - Indonesia (or ; Indonesian: ), officially the Republic of Indonesia, is a unitary sovereign state and transcontinental country located mainly in Southeast Asia with some territories in Oceania. Situated between the Indian and Pacific oceans, it is the world's largest island country, with more than seventeen thousand islands. At , Indonesia is the world's 14th-largest country in terms of land area and world's 7th-largest country in terms of combined sea and land area. It has an estimated population of over 260 million people and is the world's fourth most populous country, the most populous Austronesian nation, as well as the most populous Muslim-majority country. The world's most populous island of Java contains more than half of the country's population.  - Skinks are lizards belonging to the family Scincidae and the infraorder Scincomorpha. With more than 1,500 described species, the Scincidae is one of the most diverse families of lizards.  - Lygosominae is the largest subfamily of skinks in the family Scincidae. The subfamily can be divided into a number of genus groups. If the rarely used taxonomic rank of infrafamily is employed, the genus groups would be designated as such, but such a move would require a formal description according to the ICZN standards.  - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus.  - Lizards are a widespread group of squamate reptiles, with over 6,000 species, ranging across all continents except Antarctica, as well as most oceanic island chains. The group, traditionally recognized as the suborder Lacertilia, is defined as all extant members of the Lepidosauria (reptiles with overlapping scales) that are neither sphenodonts (i.e., tuatara) nor snakes  they form an evolutionary grade. While the snakes are recognized as falling phylogenetically within the Toxicofera clade from which they evolved, the sphenodonts are the sister group to the squamates, the larger monophyletic group, which includes both the lizards and the snakes.  - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus.  - Lampropholis, the Indo-Australian ground skinks or sunskinks, are a genus of skinks in the lizard subfamily Lygosominae. The genus \\"Lampropholis\\" belongs to a clade with the genera \\"Niveoscincus\\", \\"Leiolopisma\\" and possibly others of the \\"Eugongylus\\" group. They are found mainly in Indonesia and Australia. For similar skinks see genera \\"Bassiana\\", \\"Pseudemoia\\", and \\"Niveoscincus\\".  - New Zealand is an island nation in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. The country geographically comprises two main landmassesthat of the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Mui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamuand numerous smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland.  - Carlia is a genus of skinks, commonly known as four-fingered skinks, in the subfamily Lygosominae. \\"Carlia\\" belongs to a clade with the genera \\"Niveoscincus\\", \\"Lampropholis\\", and possibly others of the \\"Eugongylus\\" group.  - Tasmania (abbreviated as Tas and known colloquially as \\"Tassie\\") is an island state of the Commonwealth of Australia. It is located to the south of the Australian mainland, separated by Bass Strait. The state encompasses the main island of Tasmania, the 26th-largest island in the world, and the surrounding 334 islands.

One day, I was teaching in a very difficult classroom. I was managing behavior all morning and by lunch time, I knew I needed coffee to even consider surviving the afternoon. So on my lunch break, I drove to a coffee shop nearby to get a cup of coffee. While returning to the car I realized I had locked my keys and my phone inside! I had about 15 minutes to get back to the school which was a good 4- or 5- minute drive away. I considered rushing back, but it being winter, I thought a fall on ice would only make the situation much worse. So I ran into a McDonald's and asked the man at the counter   who happened to be the manager to please call me a taxi. I explained my situation to him, and I could tell by the look in his eyes, that he took pity. He hurried to the back to use the phone while I walked in the restaurant. I had less than 10 minutes to get back to my school at this point. The manager returned only to tell me that the taxi company had put him on hold and then the line got disconnected, and that he was now on hold again, but had not yet been able to ask for the taxi yet. Without a thought, he caught his coat and offered to drive me to the school. Immediately I followed him into his car and made it back into my classroom with 2 minutes left before the bell!

Now, let's look at our choices: (I) means they agree with each other. (II) means we can't tell if the sentences agree or disagree. (III) means they don't agree with each other. Since the first sentence is about focusing on the children and the second one is about not focusing on them, they don't agree with each other.

Write some highlights for the following article: Detectives investigating the murder of two British tourists on the Thai island of Kao Tao are hunting for three men - two of whom they say raped the female victim while the third watched. The bodies of David Miller, 24, and Hannah Witheridge, 23, were found on a beach on the holiday isle on September 15. A bloodstained garden hoe, believed to be the murder weapon, was found nearby. In the wake of heavy criticism over the investigation into their brutal deaths, police sought to allay fears that the killers had long escaped saying they were 'confident' that a significant breakthrough was on the horizon. The bodies of David Miller, 24, and Hannah Witheridge, 23, were found on a beach on Koh Tao on September 15. The last known picture of the pair, together with a group at the sports bar called Choppers - they also went to the AC bar where a group of amateur footballers were celebrating the end of a tournament. 'Two of the suspects raped and killed Witheridge while another one witnessed the murder,' Pol Lt Gen Panya Mamen, commissioner of Provincial Police Region 8, said yesterday. 'We're confident we have a very high chance of finding the suspects,' the senior police officer said. 'I'm not worried [about high public expectations] because I know how much the probe has been progressing. We just have to follow forensic results.' Police have taken more than 200 DNA samples from men living and working in the area of the crime scene - most of them being migrant workers from Burma. But there have been no matches so far with the victims. Police have been taking DNA swabs and footprints of people on the island in a bid to find the killers. A group of Thai footballers are the latest people to be questioned by police amid fears that the hunt for the killers has stalled. A spokesman for the Royal Thai Police confirmed that DNA samples were taken from 'more than eight' footballers - who reportedly threw a late-night party at the AC nightclub where the victims spent their final hours - and officers were awaiting the results. The amateur footballers were allegedly at the nightclub celebrating the end of a tournament while the British backpackers were there. Police have offered a reward of 700,000 baht - roughly £13,300 -  for information which leads to the arrests of the culprits. The murders – and Ms Witheridge's suspected rape – were the work of a group of at least three 'attackers', two of whom are Asian men, police have claimed, citing analysis of DNA and other evidence. Dressed in a pink top and white skirt, Hannah Witheridge looked happy and relaxed as she strolled past fruit stands and in and out of bars on the night before her murder. Investigating officers have said they believe sexual jealousy was the motive behind the murder of 23-year-old from Great Yarmouth in the early hours of September 15. A condom has recently been recovered from the crime scene which has the young woman's DNA on its outer skin. Police have already said that DNA recovered from her body has shown that two men took advantage of her on the morning of her death. 'The discovery of the condom is an important piece of evidence,' said provincial police commander General Kiattipong Kaosam-ang. 'Solving this crime is going to come down to DNA matches and we are working hard on this.' Her recently-met friend David Miller, 24, from Jersey died when he was attacked after - it is believed - he went to her aid when he found her in trouble near a group of boulders on the beach. The movements of David Miller and Miss Witheridge are not known afterwards though some locals claim to have seen them in a bar arguing with an Asian man. DNA found on a cigarette matches a sample taken from Miss Witheridge and police say they are hoping that matching it with a suspect would 'open the door' to finding who else was involved. 'There is no doubt the murder of Miss Witheridge was sexually motivated because none of her belongings or those of the English man were missing,' said General Kiattipong Kaosam-ang. 'Yes, the motivation for the attack is rape.' He said the attackers might have been smoking when they saw Miss Witheridge walking back to her guest house alone along the beach. Miss Witheridge's family said they are 'broken' by her death and revealed several days ago that they have returned to the UK with her body. In a statement, they said: 'As a family we feel enormous relief to have Hannah back at home where she belongs. 'We continue to work closely with officers to assist in the investigation and bring those responsible to justice. 'Our family is broken and require time to grieve in private - as do Hannah's many friends.'","output":"Thai authorities are investigating the murder of two British tourists, David Miller (24) and Hannah Witheridge (23), whose bodies were found on a beach on Koh Tao island on September 15.

Groups are also applied in many other mathematical areas. Mathematical objects are often examined by associating groups to them and studying the properties of the corresponding groups. For example, Henri Poincaré founded what is now called algebraic topology by introducing the fundamental group. By means of this connection, topological properties such as proximity and continuity translate into properties of groups.i[›] For example, elements of the fundamental group are represented by loops. The second image at the right shows some loops in a plane minus a point. The blue loop is considered null-homotopic (and thus irrelevant), because it can be continuously shrunk to a point. The presence of the hole prevents the orange loop from being shrunk to a point.

Paragraph: Victims of domestic violence will have access to quality legal representation through a campaign undertaken by Idaho Supreme Court Chief Justice Linda Copple Trout and corporate leaders. \\"Thousands of times a year, Idahoans are victims of domestic violence. The victims are often women and their children and they frequently have few resources with which to pursue their legal rights,\\" Trout said Tuesday. \\"This campaign helps fill that gap in legal services for women who need the help at a time when they are in crisis.\\" The Idaho Partners for Justice Project has already secured pledges of more than 35,000 from law firms, attorneys, corporations and individuals. The goal is 100,000. The drive to pay for free legal services will continue for the next two months. The money goes to Idaho Legal Aid Services and the Idaho Volunteer Lawyers Program. Last year, more than 5,000 petitions were filed in Idaho for protection orders in domestic violence cases. More than 12,000 victims contacted shelters or crisis hotlines. Joining Trout in the announcement was Idaho Bar Association President Fred Hoopes of Idaho Falls and Ida-West Energy Co. Chief Executive Officer Randy Hill, members of the project's executive committee. Also on hand were some women who were victims of such violence, but benefited from free legal services. Last year's campaign generated enough money and resources to help more than 450 victims.

Lifeguard Bill Bender told NBC San Diego, \\"Witnesses stated seeing someone distracted by an electronic device and he just fell over the edge.\\" The reason for the man's distraction remains unconfirmed, but NBC San Diego cites lifeguard speculation that it was a phone or camera. A device, however, has not yet been recovered from the scene. The man had reportedly driven to the area with a passenger to watch the sunset. KABC reports that after struggling to find parking, he exited the vehicle in search of a spot. It was then that witnesses saw him engrossed in a device before he plummeted 60 feet to his death. Heroic Attempts to Save the Victim Following the man's fall, three witnesses put themselves at risk by making their way down the rocks to administer CPR. Despite their courageous efforts, the man was pronounced dead at the scene. Conclusion The unfortunate incident at the Sunset Cliffs area on Christmas Day has highlighted the dangers of distracted walking, which can be as hazardous as distracted driving.

Text:  Longer wires have more resistance than shorter wires. A:","output":"If a wire were to be cut in half, each half would have less resistance than the whole wire. This conclusion can be deduced from the given text, which states that \\"longer wires have more resistance than shorter wires.\\" When the wire is cut into two pieces, the length of each piece becomes shorter than the original wire. As a result, the resistance of each half will be less than the resistance of the entire wire. To further explain this concept, let's consider the factors that determine wire resistance. The resistance of a wire (R) can be calculated using the formula: R = ρ (L/A), where ρ (rho) is the resistivity of the material, L is the length of the wire, and A is the cross-sectional area of the wire. When the wire is halved, two significant changes occur: 1. The length of the wire (L) decreases, which directly affects the resistance. As the formula shows, when the length of the wire decreases, the resistance also decreases. Since each half of the wire is half its original length, their resistance will inevitably be lower than that of the complete wire. 2. The cross-sectional area of the wire (A) remains constant for each half. Since the wire has been cut but not split or changed in any other manner, its cross-sectional area does not change. As a result, the resistance will not be affected by the area in this context. In summary, cutting a wire in half will result in each half possessing less resistance than the whole wire, primarily due to the reduction in length. This conclusion aligns with the provided text, which states that shorter wires have less resistance than longer wires."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The Yacolt Fire Department confirmed that medics responded to Moulton Falls Regional Park Tuesday afternoon on reports that a teen girl was hurt after going over the popular pedestrian bridge.      First responders told FOX 12 the girl was out of the water when they arrived and she was alert and conscious when she was taken to the hospital by ambulance.      A video posted by a family member shows a girl standing on a ledge over the railing while surrounded by a group of people. One person is heard yelling a countdown, and when the teen doesn’t jump, another person is seen pushing her off the bridge – her arms flail out as she appears to fall toward the water torso-first.      Tanner Peterson was jumping off the same bridge Wednesday evening. He said he saw the video of the teen falling off the bridge on YouTube, and decided to visit the park for the first time, just to jump.      “She face-planted that, her pusher just threw her whole upper body off and that would be the scariest five seconds of her life,” Peterson said. “If that was someone I knew, I’d be really upset with the person who pushed them.”      Despite signs warning people not to dive or jump of the bridge, several others jumped off Wednesday evening.      Peterson said he wasn’t worried about the water or his jumping technique, but believes a push off the bridge should be a crime.      “You hit wrong and it’s like hitting concrete,” Peterson said. “You could die, easy. If your head hits and your neck breaks, you’re going to die.”      Firefighters said the jump is dangerous, not recommended, and the injuries at the bridge are stacking up. Officials said medics have responded to four cases this summer alone – a new record.      They rescued a man who lost consciousness after making the jump a couple of weeks ago.      “Someone pulled him out of the water, and just right under the bridge, and put him on a rock that’s pretty even,” Edgar Ruesga said. “He was out, he was unconscious.”      As for the teenage girl, officials at PeaceHealth Southwest Medical Center said she is in stable condition.      The Clark County Sheriff’s Office told FOX 12 that the case is being investigated and several witnesses have been contacted.      Copyright 2018 KPTV-KPDX Broadcasting Corporation.

Answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: BC Social Report, August 14, 2010 Scandinavians may spend a lot of the winter in darkness but they are the happiest people in Europe, according to a study showed this month. Countries like Denmark and Finland scored highest on the study of happiness in Europe carried out by Cambridge University, which also found that the sunny southern countries of Italy, Portugal and Greece got the least joy out of  life. The survey entitled:  \\"No Man is an Island\\" showed that countries where people enjoy time with friends and family, have trust in government and national institutions were more likely to be happy than those living in a sunny climate. The study rated respondent on their overall sense of happiness and life satisfaction on a _ of one to 10. Danes  --who expressed a high level of trust in their politicians and public institutions--came top of the field at 8.3. Italians--who reported lower levels of satisfaction with their national quality of government--came last at 6.49.' \\"Italy, Greece, Portugal, Germany and France report the lowest levels of happiness while the Scandinavian Countries, Netherlands and Luxembourg report the highest,\\" the study said. Although Europeans are generally four times wealthier than their fathers and grandfathers, their levels of happiness are either equal to or lower than 40 years ago. The study also looked at factors contributing to happiness within countries and surprisingly found that an interest in politics actually increased happiness. Lead researcher Luisa Corrado said tax cuts and throwing money at social problems appeared to have no effect on the happiness of citizens when compared with government policies which strengthened and supported wider social networks.  \\"People are less naive ( ) than one would expect, politicians need to adapted their policies and target specific problems in specific areas,\\" she said.

What is the story behind anonymous animals on Google Sheets and Docs? Imagine you're in a playground with your friends, and you're all wearing animal masks so no one knows who you are. Google Sheets and Docs have a similar feature, called anonymous animals. When people who haven't signed in with their Google account view or edit a Google Sheet or Doc, instead of showing their names, Google gives them an \\"animal mask.\\" This way, people can collaborate on the same document without knowing each other's identities. There are many different anonymous animals like elephants, camels, and penguins. It helps keep things fun and private! 2. Is there any way I can receive any kind of reminder, alarm, or notification based on a simple word on a Google Doc or Sheet? Unfortunately, Google Docs and Sheets don't have a built-in way to send reminders, alarms, or notifications based on words. However, you can work around this by using an app called \\"Google Calendar.\\" First, find the word you want a reminder for and decide when you want the reminder. Next, go to Google Calendar, create a new event and type the word into the event's title or description. Finally, set a reminder for this event. Now, Google Calendar will send you a notification when it's time for the reminder! 3. Would you say that these questions are the same? No, these questions are not the same.

He was best known for his national radio and television acts between 1937 and 1971, and as host of the television program The Red Skelton Show. He has stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his work in radio and television, and also appeared in burlesque, vaudeville, films, nightclubs, and casinos, all while he pursued an entirely separate career as an artist. Skelton began developing his comedic and pantomime skills from the age of 10, when he became part of a traveling medicine show. Skelton and Edna worked for a year in Camden, New Jersey, and were able to get an engagement at Montreal's Lido Club in 1934 through a friend who managed the chorus lines at New York's Roxy Theatre. Despite an initial rocky start, the act was a success, and brought them more theater dates throughout Canada.  Skelton's performances in Canada led to new opportunities and the inspiration for a new, innovative routine that brought him recognition in the years to come. While performing in Montreal, the Skeltons met Harry Anger, a vaudeville producer for New York City's Loew's State Theatre. Anger promised the pair a booking as a headlining act at Loew's, but they would need to come up with new material for the engagement. While the Skeltons were having breakfast in a Montreal diner, Edna had an idea for a new routine as she and Skelton observed the other patrons eating doughnuts and drinking coffee. They devised the \\"Doughnut Dunkers\\" routine, with Skelton's visual impressions of how different people ate doughnuts. The skit won them the Loew's State engagement and a handsome fee.  The couple viewed the Loew's State engagement in 1937 as Skelton's big chance. They hired New York comedy writers to prepare material for the engagement, believing they needed more sophisticated jokes and skits than the routines Skelton normally performed. However, his New York audience did not laugh or applaud until Skelton abandoned the newly written material and began performing the \\"Doughnut Dunkers\\" and his older routines. The doughnut-dunking routine also helped Skelton rise to celebrity status. In 1937, while he was entertaining at the Capitol Theater in Washington, D.C., President Franklin D. Roosevelt invited Skelton to perform at a White House luncheon. During one of the official toasts, Skelton grabbed Roosevelt's glass, saying, \\"Careful what you drink, Mr. President. I got rolled in a place like this once.\\" His humor appealed to FDR and Skelton became the master of ceremonies for Roosevelt's official birthday celebration for many years afterward. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: Was this found to be funny?","output":"Yes, Skelton's humor was found to be funny. As mentioned in the article, his New York audience did not laugh or applaud until Skelton abandoned the newly written material and began performing the \\"Doughnut Dunkers\\" and his older routines. Moreover, his humor appealed to President Franklin D. Roosevelt, which led to Skelton becoming the master of ceremonies for Roosevelt's official birthday celebration for many years afterward."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Stan went to a group to try to accept that Sheila was gone. It was a group for people whose unrequited love had ended in some kind of surrealist moment. There is a group for everything in California. After several months of hard work on himself with the group, Stan was ready to open a shop and sell the thousands of yellow gumballs.

When he closed the store each night he would count the gumballs sold, and he would determine his gross revenue, his operating expenses, his operating margin; he would adjust his balance sheet and learn his debt to equity ratio; and after this exercise each night, Stan felt he understood himself and was at peace, and he could go home to his apartment and drink tea and sleep, without shooting himself or thinking about Sheila.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize: You don't need to fake cheeriness, but try not to get bogged down in worrying about the particulars of your relationship. Let your time together be easy, fun, and stress-free. If you and your boyfriend only ever talk about the heavy stuff, he may have formed negative associations around hanging out with you. That said: if you need to talk about these things, you may as well let them out. Whether it's a walk, a trip to the beach, or a movie night – find something that you both can get excited about. Consider what he's into lately, and what he might most want to spend his time on. Think back to where you met him and what the two of you did together at the beginning of your relationship. Find common ground.  If you aren't sure, you might need to take a more active approach. Try as many different things as you can until you find a few that you both enjoy. Think about what he does with his friends. You don't need to do these things, and you shouldn't cut completely into his friend time – but it might help to understand where his time is going. Engage with his thoughts and feelings while still being true to your own. Be considerate, and don't force him to do things that make him comfortable. Don't try to make him jealous or stressed-out just so that he will hang out with you. When you are hanging out together, try to strike a balance between what you want to do and what he wants to do. Sometimes, you might have to spend time doing something that bores you in order to be around him. If you do things that your boyfriend likes doing, he may be much more open to spending time with you when you're doing things that he doesn't enjoy. For example: Say that you hate baseball, but your boyfriend loves it – and you love going to museums, but your boyfriend can't stand them. Make an agreement: if you go to a baseball game, he'll accompany you to a museum! . Check back in periodically to see if things have improved. If you find your boyfriend spending more time with you in an enjoyable way, then you should keep doing what you're doing. However: if he still isn't spending time with you despite your best efforts, then it might be time to end things. You may simply not have common interests; he may not like you as much as you think; or he may just generally not spend much time with his partners. Whatever the case, he's clearly not giving you the attention you need – so if you aren't comfortable, you might consider leaving him.","output":"In summary, it is essential to maintain a balance between addressing relationship concerns and enjoying light-hearted moments with your boyfriend. Aim for stress-free and fun experiences while still addressing important matters if needed. To find activities you both enjoy, consider your boyfriend's current interests, reflect on what you did together early in your relationship, and find common ground. Exploring various activities together and paying attention to what he does with his friends can provide insight into what he enjoys spending time on. However, don't intrude on his friendships or sacrifice your own interests. Be considerate, engaging, and genuine in your interactions, while also respecting his comfort levels. Striking a balance between your preferences and his is crucial, and sometimes making compromises can help strengthen your bond. Periodically assess the situation and the quality of time you spend together. If you observe improvements, continue with your approach. However, if your boyfriend is still not spending time with you despite your efforts, it may be time to consider if the relationship is meeting your needs and whether it should continue. Reasons could range from a lack of common interests to decreased feelings or incompatible habits in relationships. Ultimately, prioritize finding a balance that brings happiness, understanding, and mutual respect to both of you."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Background: Adolf Hitler (German: ['adolf 'hItla] ( listen); 20 April 1889 - 30 April 1945) was a German politician who was the leader of the Nazi Party (Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei; NSDAP), Chancellor of Germany from 1933 to 1945 and Fuhrer (\\"Leader\\") of Nazi Germany from 1934 to 1945. As dictator, Hitler initiated World War II in Europe with the invasion of Poland in September 1939, and was central to the Holocaust. Hitler was born in Austria--then part of Austria-Hungary--and was raised near Linz. He moved to Germany in 1913 and was decorated during his service in the German Army in World War I. Context: Adolf Hitler was born on 20 April 1889 in Braunau am Inn, a town in Austria-Hungary (in present-day Austria), close to the border with the German Empire. He was christened as \\"Adolphus Hitler\\". He was the fourth of six children born to Alois Hitler and his third wife, Klara Polzl. Three of Hitler's siblings--Gustav, Ida, and Otto--died in infancy. Also living in the household were Alois's children from his second marriage: Alois Jr. (born 1882) and Angela (born 1883). When Hitler was three, the family moved to Passau, Germany. There he acquired the distinctive lower Bavarian dialect, rather than Austrian German, which marked his speech throughout his life. The family returned to Austria and settled in Leonding in 1894, and in June 1895 Alois retired to Hafeld, near Lambach, where he farmed and kept bees. Hitler attended Volksschule (a state-owned school) in nearby Fischlham.  The move to Hafeld coincided with the onset of intense father-son conflicts caused by Hitler's refusal to conform to the strict discipline of his school. Alois Hitler's farming efforts at Hafeld ended in failure, and in 1897 the family moved to Lambach. The eight-year-old Hitler took singing lessons, sang in the church choir, and even considered becoming a priest. In 1898 the family returned permanently to Leonding. Hitler was deeply affected by the death of his younger brother Edmund, who died in 1900 from measles. Hitler changed from a confident, outgoing, conscientious student to a morose, detached boy who constantly fought with his father and teachers.  Alois had made a successful career in the customs bureau, and wanted his son to follow in his footsteps. Hitler later dramatised an episode from this period when his father took him to visit a customs office, depicting it as an event that gave rise to an unforgiving antagonism between father and son, who were both strong-willed. Ignoring his son's desire to attend a classical high school and become an artist, Alois sent Hitler to the Realschule in Linz in September 1900. Hitler rebelled against this decision, and in Mein Kampf states that he intentionally did poorly in school, hoping that once his father saw \\"what little progress I was making at the technical school he would let me devote myself to my dream\\".  Like many Austrian Germans, Hitler began to develop German nationalist ideas from a young age. He expressed loyalty only to Germany, despising the declining Habsburg Monarchy and its rule over an ethnically variegated empire. Hitler and his friends used the greeting \\"Heil\\", and sang the \\"Deutschlandlied\\" instead of the Austrian Imperial anthem.  After Alois's sudden death on 3 January 1903, Hitler's performance at school deteriorated and his mother allowed him to leave. He enrolled at the Realschule in Steyr in September 1904, where his behaviour and performance improved. In 1905, after passing a repeat of the final exam, Hitler left the school without any ambitions for further education or clear plans for a career. Question: Did he attend highschool?. Whats the answer?","output":"Yes, Adolf Hitler attended high school. He went to the Realschule in Linz and later enrolled at the Realschule in Steyr. However, his performance in school was initially poor, and he eventually left without any ambitions for further education or clear plans for a career."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

An arrow pierced through the darkness, its barbed head tearing through flesh and muscle. A roar echoed off of the mountains far to the west. A cry broke through soon after. Then silence. Char stood over a pile of black fur and red blood. He held a curved sword, jagged half way down the wide blade and hilted in bone. He held a large thick bow in the other. Lorfel and Ranur stood behind him, panting. Lorfel, a short man of twenty six held a large axe in both hands and still prepared to swing it hard. Ranur, the largest of the three held a pike in one hand, its tip hanging low towards the ground. He buried his other hand in his gray tunic. \\"Did it get either of you?\\" Char's voice rasped low in the silence of the night. \\"No\\" Lorfel said. He planted his axe head on the ground with a thud and leaned on the tall handle. There was a pause. Char turned towards Ranur. \\"Are you hurt?\\" \\"Mm...My hand.\\" Ranur took his hand out of his tunic. Moonlight gleamed red off of the ragged wound. Char thought he saw a glimmer of bone. \\"Did he claw you or bite you?\\" Char's voice held an urgency that set both Lorfel and Ranur on edge. Ranur paused and then spoke low. \\"He bit me.\\" Char picked Lorfel and Ranur as his hunting partners for their speed and sharpness in battle. They had hunted beasts of the deep woods all of their lives. They hunted the beasts that hunted men. They all knew the risks of battling such creatures.

This inspires Commander Mark Harmon ( played by José Jiménez ) to recite some of the lines of Wally Schirra to the great amusement of all at the table . Choose your answer from: (A). no (B). yes","output":"(B). yes Both sentences convey the same meaning, despite their slight differences in phrasing. To better understand this, let's break down each of these sentences. 1. \\"This inspires Commander Mark Harmon (played by José Jiménez) to recite some of Wally Schirra's lines, to the great amusement of everyone at the table.\\" 2. \\"This inspires Commander Mark Harmon (played by José Jiménez) to recite some of the lines of Wally Schirra to the great amusement of all at the table.\\" In both sentences, \\"This\\" serves as the subject, and it refers to an action or event that prompts Commander Mark Harmon's response. Commander Mark Harmon, played by José Jiménez, is the main character in both sentences. Next, let's examine the section about Wally Schirra's lines: 1. Wally Schirra's lines 2. the lines of Wally Schirra Both phrases convey that Commander Mark Harmon is reciting lines that belong to or are associated with Wally Schirra. Using the possessive form (Schirra's) or the \\"of\\" form (lines of) do not change the meaning of the phrase. Lastly, let's analyze the reactions of the people at the table: 1. to the great amusement of everyone at the table 2. to the great amusement of all at the table In both cases, the reactions are of amusement, and the people experiencing this amusement are those present at the table. The only difference between the two phrases is the use of \\"everyone\\" and \\"all,\\" which in this context are synonyms and can be used interchangeably. Therefore, considering that both sentences express the same idea—Commander Mark Harmon, played by José Jiménez, reciting Wally Schirra's lines to the amusement of those at the table—the correct answer is (B). Yes, both sentences share the same meaning."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer.

Given list: [-79, 53, -94, 38, -29, -50, -26, 57] We will calculate the averages as follows: 1. Average of -79 and 53 = (-79 + 53) / 2 = -26 / 2 = -13 2. Average of 53 and -94 = (53 + -94) / 2 = -41 / 2 = -20.5 3. Average of -94 and 38 = (-94 + 38) / 2 = -56 / 2 = -28 4. Average of 38 and -29 = (38 + -29) / 2 = 9 / 2 = 4.5 5. Average of -29 and -50 = (-29 + -50) / 2 = -79 / 2 = -39.5 6. Average of -50 and -26 = (-50 + -26) / 2 = -76 / 2 = -38 7. Average of -26 and 57 = (-26 + 57) / 2 = 31 / 2 = 15.5 So, the output list of the averages of each two consecutive values is: [-13, -20.5, -28, 4.5, -39.5, -38, 15.5]"},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Steven Taylor’s contribution to Newcastle’s winless start to the Premier League season amounted to little more than 60 seconds. Seven games without victory, United were adrift in the relegation places with their long-serving defender having warmed the bench for the majority. Now, on the back of maximum returns against Leicester and Spurs, the Magpies are up to 14th and manager Alan Pardew’s job is safe. Steven Taylor has played for Newcastle United for the last eleven years - since he was 16 years old. The former England Under 21 captain has found first team appearances hard to come by of late. Taylor has played every minute of those victories but was only recalled in the wake of an injury to Mike Williamson. The starting XI, however, is where the 28-year-old intends to stay and, when asked if he now deserved his place in the side, Taylor shot back: ‘Absolutely. The one thing I’ve done is waited for my chance and kept myself in good shape. ‘I’ve taken my chance and that’s what I had to do – we’ve got three points in both games. ‘One hundred per cent (I intend to stay in the side). I love my football and there’s nothing better than playing in front of 52,000 fans, that’s where I want to be.’ Since an injury to Mike Williamson though, Taylor has rejoined the Newcastle back-line for two wins in a row. Taylor (left) insists that he wants to make the position his own, as Newcastle moved up to 16th on Sunday. Taylor, the former England Under-21 captain, was sent off on the opening day of last season following a reckless elbow on Sergio Aguero during a 4-0 defeat at Manchester City. Pardew lost faith in the centre-back following that dismissal and he appeared just nine times in the league during the remainder of the campaign. And, ahead of tomorrow’s return to the Etihad Stadium, Taylor reflected: ‘It’s horrible (being out of the team). You’ve just got to knuckle down and work hard and make sure you take that chance when it comes. Now, I’m feeling full of confidence. ‘But the rest of the lads have been fantastic and it’s been a real team effort these past two games.’ Taylor is not one to shirk from danger - pictured here (second left) putting his body on the line against Leicester. Taylor (second left) celebrates with team-mates Paul Dummett and Tim Krul after Sunday's win against Spurs. Taylor prefers not to talk about his red card but believes United travel to City for their Capital One Cup fourth-round tie in good spirits. ‘If you win games you are confident,’ he said, Sammy Ameobi and Ayoze Perez having got the second-half goals during Sunday’s 2-1 win at Spurs. ‘We have that belief to stay in a game even when we are not playing well. ‘We did not play that well in the first half (at Spurs) even though we created a few chances. ‘But we had no fear - you cannot playing with fear when you go to White Hart Lane. Taylor (centre) looked delighted at the full-time whistle against Tottenham at White Hart Lane on Sunday. Taylor's first game back after Mike Williamson's injury coincided with Newcastle's first win of the season. ‘I thought we were fantastic in the second half. We really stuck at it. They had one shot maybe. When you come to Tottenham that doesn’t ever happen. ‘In the second half only one team was in it. We have creativity in the side and Sammy Ameobi was a breath of fresh air for us. He showed that. ‘And it was great for Ayoze Perez to get his goal. He is a goalscorer, put the ball in front of him and he has that ability. ‘We are now looking forward to City. It will be tough game, we know that, but we will cause them problems.’ What are the important parts of this article?","output":"The important parts of this article focus on Steven Taylor's contribution to Newcastle United's success during the time of the article and his determination to maintain his position in the team's starting lineup. Taylor, who had been with the team since he was 16, had to regain the trust and confidence of manager Alan Pardew after a red card incident in the previous season. Due to injury to his teammate Mike Williamson, Taylor got a chance to play and helped the team secure two wins in a row, moving them up in the Premier League rankings. Taylor emphasized his commitment to remaining in the starting lineup and expressed his confidence in the team's recent performances.

Vietnam A:","output":"Title: The Last Battle Plot: The story is set in the year 1997, where the emotional and psychological effects of the Vietnam War still plague its veterans. The protagonist, Frankie, is a former soldier who served in the Vietnam War. He now leads a low-key life as a mechanic in a small garage owned by his sister, Anna, and tends to avoid social interaction. One regular day at the garage, Frankie encounters a mysterious man named John, who is desperately seeking help as his car has broken down. Frankie recognizes an unusual tattoo on John's arm from his days in Vietnam, which reveals his past as a war veteran and a member of the same unit Frankie was with during the war. The duo is surprised to find each other alive after so many years, as most of their comrades from the war have passed away. As they reconnect, Frankie learns that John is on a mission to find and bring justice to a notorious war criminal known as \\"The Ghost,\\" who went into hiding after the war. The Ghost is responsible for war crimes and the brutal massacre of their fellow soldiers during the Vietnam War. John believes The Ghost is now operating under a new identity in the United States. Frankie, haunted by his own past and memories of the war, decides to join John in his quest for justice. The duo begins their investigation, which takes them through the dark and grim underworld of weapon smugglers and drug cartels. Their journey brings them face to face with the evil remnants of wartime. As they inch closer to The Ghost, old memories from the war resurface. Both Frankie and John must confront their own nightmares and traumas before they can finally come face to face with the man responsible for the atrocities they had to endure.  The climax of the film sees an epic showdown between Frankie, John, and The Ghost in an abandoned warehouse, where Frankie is forced to relive the horrors of his time in Vietnam. In the end, Frankie manages to conquer his demons and avenges his fallen comrades. He kills The Ghost, in not just a physical battle, but also a psychological one. In the aftermath, Frankie and John, both scarred by their experiences, find solace in each other's company and finally start to come to terms with their past. They spearhead an initiative to help other veterans like them deal with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and adjust to civilian life. The film ends with a touching tribute to all those who have served and lived through the traumatic experiences of war."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

To analyze this situation further, let's break down each statement and examine the logical relationship between them. Statement 1: \\"A man wearing a gray jacket standing on the side of a street.\\" This statement describes the man's specific location and attire. The location is the side of a street, and the attire consists of a gray jacket. Statement 2: \\"The man on the side of the street is wearing a bright red coat.\\" This statement has a similar structure to Statement 1. It describes the attire of a man who is at the same location as the one mentioned in Statement 1 - the side of a street. However, the attire mentioned in this statement is different - a bright red coat. To determine whether it logically follows that \\"The man on the side of the street is wearing a bright red coat,\\" when given that \\"a man wearing a gray jacket standing on the side of a street,\\" we can use logical principles to examine the relationship between the statements. One such principle is the Law of Non-Contradiction, which states that contradictory statements cannot both be true at the same time and in the same sense. In this case, the attire of the man is contradictory (gray jacket vs. bright red coat). Thus, it is not logically possible for both statements to be true simultaneously. If we assume that the statement \\"a man wearing a gray jacket standing on the side of a street\\" is true, then the statement \\"The man on the side of the street is wearing a bright red coat\\" must be false, as the description of the man's attire contradicts the first statement. It is important to note that this conclusion assumes we are referring to the same man in both statements. To summarize, it does not logically follow that \\"The man on the side of the street is wearing a bright red coat\\" when given the statement \\"a man wearing a gray jacket standing on the side of a street.\\" Both statements are contradictory in nature, and if we accept one as true, the other must be false."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

These add-ons and toolbars not only slow down the browser's performance but may also bring security risks. This article will guide you step-by-step on how to remove these unwanted entities from your Firefox browser and protect your computer from potential malware attacks. Section 1: Understanding Add-ons and Toolbars Add-ons are extensions, plugins, or small applications created by developers to enhance the browser's functionality, including managing passwords, blocking ads, or altering the browser's appearance. On the other hand, toolbars are a type of add-on that usually appears beneath the address bar, offering shortcuts to frequently accessed websites, search engines, or other services. While add-ons and toolbars can improve your browsing experience, some may be unnecessary, intrusive, or even harmful. It is essential to know how to manage and remove them when needed. Section 2: Opening the Add-on Manager in Firefox The first step in removing an unwanted add-on or toolbar is to open the Add-on Manager. Follow these simple steps: 1. Launch the Firefox browser. 2. Click the menu button (three horizontal lines) located in the upper-right corner of the Firefox window. 3. Select \\"Add-ons and Themes\\" or simply \\"Add-ons\\" from the dropdown menu. 4. The Add-on Manager tab will open, displaying a list of installed extensions, themes, and plugins. Section 3: Finding and Removing the Unwanted Add-on Once the Add-on Manager is open, follow these steps to find and remove the unwanted add-on: 1. Browse through the list of installed extensions (These are the add-ons in Firefox). 2. Locate the add-on or toolbar you want to remove. 3. Click the three-dot menu button next to the add-on's name. 4. Select \\"Remove\\" from the dropdown menu to uninstall the add-on. 5. A confirmation message will appear, select \\"Remove\\" again to confirm the uninstallation. Section 4: Restarting Firefox After removing the unwanted add-on, it is necessary to restart the Firefox browser for the changes to take effect. Close all Firefox windows and reopen the browser. The removed add-on should no longer be present in your browser. Section 5: Dealing with Stubborn Toolbars In some cases, toolbars can be persistent and difficult to remove using the standard method outlined above. In such situations, using antimalware software can help eliminate the stubborn toolbars.  1. Download and install a reputable antimalware software, such as Malwarebytes, Norton, or Bitdefender. 2. Update the software to ensure it has the most recent malware definitions. 3. Perform a full or custom scan on your computer, specifically targeting browsers or browser-related files. 4. The antimalware software will detect and quarantine the problematic toolbar and any related malicious files. 5. Follow the software's instructions to remove the toolbar and any associated threats. Section 6: Staying Safe and Preventing Unwanted Add-ons and Toolbars To reduce the chances of future incidents with unwanted add-ons and toolbars, try following these tips: 1. Download add-ons and toolbars only from the official Firefox Add-on website or trusted sources. 2. Pay close attention during the installation of new software, as some may bundle unwanted toolbars or add-ons. 3. Regularly update your browser and antimalware software to protect against new threats. 4. Periodically check the list of installed add-ons and remove any that you no longer use or are suspicious. Conclusion: Unwanted add-ons and toolbars can compromise your browsing experience and pose a threat to your computer's security.

Article: Parents divorced, little Buddy was in the care of his mother's large Alabama family. Over the years, Buddy seldom saw either of his parents. But he was happy where he was and he had many kindly  s, among whom Miss Sook was by far his best friend. Before Christmas, Buddy's father had managed to get legal custody  of him for this Christmas. So, he had a new suit, with a card pinned with his name and address and made the trip alone, by bus, to New Orleans. Several things occurred that kept me awake the whole night. First, the footfalls, the noise of my father running up and down the stairs, breathing heavily, I had to see what he was up to. So I hid and watched. There was a Christmas tree and the fireplace downstairs. Moreover, I could see my father. He was crawling around under the tree arranging a pyramid of packages. I felt dizzy, for what I saw forced me to reconsider everything. If these were presents intended for me, then obviously they had not been ordered by the Lord and delivered by Santa Claus; no, they were gifts bought and wrapped by my father. Which meant that my rotten little cousin Billy Bob and other rotten kids like him weren't lying when they laughed at me and told me there was no Santa Claus. The worst thought was: Had Sook known the truth, and lied to me? No, Sook would never lie to me. She believed. It was just that--well, though she was sixty-something, in some ways she was at least as much of a child as I was. I waited until I was sure he was in bed and sound asleep. Then I crept downstairs and examined the tags attached to each of the packages. They all said: \\"For Buddy.\\" I decided to open the packages: It was Christmas morning. I was awake, so why not? I won't bother to describe what was inside them: just shirts and sweaters and dull stuff like that. The only thing I appreciated was a toy gun. Somehow I got the idea it would be fun to waken my father by firing it. So I did. Bang. Bang. Bang. He raced out of his room, wild-eyed, Bang. Bang.

(June 2013) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Introduction: The title card is shown as a billboard behind which Wile E. Coyote is hiding, ready to chase the Road Runner. He starts the chase, until he runs into a large truck. Wile E. runs the other way, and the truck shows the credit. The chase ends in a win for the truck, and the Coyote emerges battered. A box with director Chuck Jones' credit then squashes him. The Coyote throws the box away, and the shot freezes: COYOTE - Eatius Birdius. He resumes the chase, which freezes to show the Road Runner: Delicius-Delicius. The chase continues down the road until the Road Runner makes a U-turn. The Coyote turns around, then stops. The Road Runner completes the circuit around, meanwhile, and beeps as the Coyote turns around, causing him to leap back. The Road Runner starts off down the road and loosens it from its hinge briefly. Wile E. points worriedly and displays an \\"EGAD\\" sign, then an \\"!!\\" sign. He drops them and thinks of his new plan. 1. Wile E. hides in a manhole, and as the Road Runner passes over him, he pops out and fires a rifle. The bullet and the Road Runner are shown in slow time, with the bullet closing to within a half-body length of the bird. Then the Road Runner turns to notice the threat, lets out a beep and gears into super speed. The bullet then brakes in puzzlement and falls to the ground. Wile E. picks it up, and then it detonates. Behind another rock face (in completely different desert scenery), Wile E. paces until he comes up with a new plan. 2. Wile E. leaps out into the road with \\"1 sheet ACME Triple Strength BATTLESHIP STEEL ARMOR PLATE\\" in front of him; even this cannot stop the Road Runner from barreling through it. The Coyote stares in puzzlement at the resulting hole, which shows only the scenery behind him where parts of his body should logically be, then walks... The answer to this question is:","output":"While Wile E. Coyote paces behind the rock face in the completely different desert scenery, he is thinking and strategizing, attempting to come up with a new plan to catch the Road Runner.

At Catskill Game Farm there were Peacocks that walked around free and made startling noises. There were also punk flamingoes there that were amazing to see. Maybe the funniest (not so funny though) thing was in the area where you could feed deer and baby pigs so sometimes they’d all come around at once and mob you? My daughter wanted to feed who she wanted to feed but the deer and the pigs had their own ideas. The deer liked these crackers kind of like rye crisps and the baby pigs went for the bottles of milk or formula. When my daughter tried to pick and choose and just feed one suddenly she would be surrounded by many. I think my husband must have videos of what transpired. One of these days it might be entertaining to view them again. At the Bronx Zoo I remember going one or more years during the winter to see the animal light sculptures and huge block ice carving and the penguins and polar bears maybe? I can’t remember anything funny happening. When we went out to San Diego around years ago during a business trip my husband got to go on then my daughter and I went with him.

The official death toll has reached 114 -- including 66 women, 28 children and 20 men, the ministry said. The bodies of 15 people are still missing. There were 208 people on the \\"Bulgaria\\" at the time of the accident Sunday, of whom 79 were rescued. Divers have checked all the boat's compartments, the ministry said, and are now looking for more bodies around the boat as well downstream on the Volga River, where they could have been carried by the current. The area where search efforts continue has been enlarged to 200 kilometers (125 miles) from the scene, Russian Transport Minister Igor Levitin said at a briefing Friday. Preparations are under way for the cruise ship to be raised from the river bottom in the coming days. Two large boat cranes, one from Moscow and another one from Volgograd, which will be used for the lifting, are on the way to the accident site. \\"We have asked the Emergency Situations Ministry to keep 23 divers at the scene to continue the search for bodies even during the lifting operation,\\" Levitin said.

A former chief of the Basque terrorist group ETA has been sentenced to 105 years in prison for ordering the assassination of a politician, according to a copy of the court ruling, made public Monday. It is the first sentence in a case involving ETA from the National Court, which handles terrorism cases, since ETA announced last month \\"a definitive cessation of its armed activity,\\" raising hopes that decades of separatist violence may finally be over. The maximum that can be served in Spanish prison is 40 years, although courts often hand down a longer sentence for terrorist attacks. Spain has no death penalty. In the sentence issued last Friday but made public on Monday, the court ruled that Francisco Javier Garcia Gaztelu, whom Spanish authorities called the military chief of ETA when he was captured in 2001, ordered the assassination of a Basque Socialist politician, Fernando Buesa. Buesa and his bodyguard were killed in the Basque city of Vitoria in northern Spain in February 2000 when they walked past a vehicle that contained a hidden bomb that was exploded by remote control. Garcia Gaztelu, now 45, was sentenced to 30 years each for the killings of Buesa and his bodyguard, 13 years each for two people injured in the attack, and additional time mainly for damage caused by the bomb, the court said. The government, courts and police have said they will not halt the court cases pending against ETA operatives despite the outlawed group's announcement last month. Listed as a terrorist organization by Spain, the United States and the European Union, ETA is blamed for more than 800 deaths in its decades-long fight for an independent Basque state that it wants carved out of sections of northern Spain and southwestern France. ETA's announcement last month followed a recent push for the group to abandon violence permanently. That effort was led by international figures who include Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams of Northern Ireland and former U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan. Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero termed ETA's announcement as being of \\"transcendental importance\\" and a \\"victory for democracy.\\" \\"Ours will be a democracy without terrorism, but not without memory,\\" Zapatero said, referring to 829 people killed by ETA and their families. The prime minister said that it would be up to Spain's next government -- which will be formed after parliamentary elections on November 20 -- to lead the peace process. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","output":"The National Court of Spain has sentenced Francisco Javier Garcia Gaztelu, a former chief of the Basque terrorist group ETA, to 105 years in prison for ordering the assassination of a Basque Socialist politician, Fernando Buesa.

The little moments of this film are so accurate and right on pace with what is going on in the minds and hearts of young girls during those coming of age teenage years. Now at my age I want to preach to them about their decisions and how life during those times are not as important as it all seems in those moments. That if they can be patient in their youth and wait to experience the hardships of life both external and internal that life would be so much sweeter. But then again young people today are faced with some variables that I never had to deal with a youth.  The three main characters well played by all three actors (Kerry Wahington - Lanisha, Anna Simpson - Joycelyn and Melissa Martinez- Maria) give us the very believable depiction of a piece of reality for young girls living in impoverished situations. They have impoverished family lives all being raised by single mothers with expectation of Lanisha whose father is present but not actively supporting her day to day. The have impoverished educational systems and lack direct contact with achieving role models. These situations powerfully affect them and is their reality but all this is of no great depressive concern to these young women in their day to day. They except their plight and focus on the same things young girls all over the world are concerned with. Finding true love in a male, having good friends that you can depend on, gaining some respect/love and responsibility from parents and enjoying life. This is were this film cross the race, age and gender gap imposed upon it by its characters and the setting in which it is stamped.  The Director and writer McKay explains on the DVD how each of scenes got into his head, by just observing young people of that age that lived in those types of neighborhoods. Plus you add three up and coming actresses who are not so far removed from that time in their own lives that you get a real good synergy of reality and acting at its best. The one thing I know about (African Americans and Hispanics) is that there is always a spiritual family member or neighbor that is in the foreground or near ground believing in a better day and better life and future in spite of the present situation and is role modeling that to some extent. This was never touched in the movie in order not to preach and I understand that but it also narrows the culture to having no hope in anything other than themselves.  The HOPE FACTOR: I now think about my future and where I have come from and say as Lanisha did \` Today is a good day.' Yes poverty still exists, racism, sexism, and any other ism that we can added. Yes some of each of these young girls actions perpetuate the isms and are self-destructive, everything around them is impoverished but NONE of those actions past or neither present nor their environment leaves them without hope for a bright future. I was left with saddened hope of each of the characters and a deeper desire to be a role model in the life of some young girl on the edge of making a destructive decision. I suppose that is the value of film it should not only entertain but cause each of us to think, reflect and then act in some positive way to make this world a better place.  What is the sentiment of this review?","output":"The sentiment of this review is predominantly positive, with a touch of nostalgia, reflection, and hope. The reviewer appreciates the realism and accuracy of the film's portrayal of teenage girls during their coming-of-age years, praising the performances of the three main actresses and the director's keen observations. However, the reviewer also acknowledges the challenges faced by the characters, the importance of hope, and the necessity to be a role model and support for young people in similar situations. Overall, the review conveys a strong emotional connection to the film and its message."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

While most networks, cable networks included, were regurgitating wire service copy and the same six minutes of videotape, Americans were turning to weblogs for the latest news and to peer-to-peer services like BitTorrent for videos, most of them shot by amateurs. The first images of the tragedy did not come from CNN, but rather were grainy, blurry photos captured by camera phones. As the network anchors drummed their manicured fingers, waiting for correspondents to parachute into position, the sketchy wire reports were supplanted by real-life, as-it-was-happening stories by bloggers who penned moving first-person accounts. You had to wait for the official death toll to be announced on CNN, but you could smell the stench of death on Evelyn Rodriguez's weblog. You could sense the horror in Morquendi's text messages, which were being sent from Sri Lanka and posted on ChiensSansFrontiers. This is as real-time as news can get. Weblogs, which started out as online diaries, have morphed into reporters' notebooks. The information is raw -- and perhaps unpolished when compared with news from more established outlets -- but it is nonetheless news. I think what we are seeing is the rise of a new kind of news network, thanks in large part to technology. Average Joes and Janes are now armed to the teeth with technology that can capture and distribute news almost anywhere. A smartphone like the Nokia 6630 has more processing power and is more connected to the Internet than a circa-1995 PC. The high-speed connections, coupled with easy-to-use newsreader software from startups like FeedDemon maker Bradbury Software, Ranchero Software, and Videora, make it a breeze to gather and read all the news in real time. Already 32 million Americans are reading weblogs. That's a large enough number to make even the biggest skeptic believe that this is a real revolution. How much of an impact will this have on the media giants? It's too early to tell. But as my colleagues over at Fortune suggest, one thing's for sure: This trend is too big to ignore. What are the most important parts of this text?","output":"The most important parts of this text can be summarized as follows: 1. The rise of weblogs and peer-to-peer services as new sources of real-time news: The tsunami disaster serves as an example of how people turned to blogs and platforms like BitTorrent for immediate updates, images, and videos, as opposed to traditional media outlets. 2. Weblogs evolving into reporters' notebooks: Bloggers provided raw, unpolished, and real-life stories as news unfolded, offering a more authentic and as-it-happened perspective compared to more established news sources. 3. Technology empowering the average person to capture and distribute news: Advancements in smartphone technology and high-speed internet connections have facilitated the easy creation and dissemination of news by non-professionals. 4. Growing popularity of weblogs: With 32 million Americans reading blogs, this trend is gaining immense traction and is considered a media revolution. 5. Impact on traditional media giants: While it is still early to determine the exact impact, it is essential for traditional media companies to recognize and adapt to the changing landscape of news consumption. In summary, the text highlights the rise of a new news network influenced by technological advancements and the public's interest in real-time information sharing. It emphasizes the growing dominance of weblogs in providing authentic, raw, and immediate news, and stresses the importance of traditional media giants acknowledging this revolution for their survival."},{"instruction":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis on Saturday slammed China's militarization of disputed South China Sea islands, insisting that weapons systems recently deployed in the area were meant to intimidate and coerce Beijing's neighbors. The comments came during a speech at the Shangri-La Dialogue, an annual Asian defense forum in Singapore. In the speech, Mattis laid out the broader U.S. strategy for a \\"free and open\\" Indo-Pacific region. \\"China's policy in the South China Sea stands in stark contrast to the openness our strategy promotes. It calls into question China's broader goals,\\" Mattis said. Specifically, the Pentagon chief mentioned China's deployment of anti-ship and surface-to-air missiles, electronic jammers, and the landing of a bomber aircraft at the Paracel Islands off the coast of Vietnam. \\"Despite China's claim to the contrary, the placement of these weapon systems is tied directly to military use for the purposes of intimidation and coercion,\\" Mattis added. Though much of the world is focused on an upcoming summit between North Korea and the United States, this year's Shangri-La Dialogue has focused primarily on the region's long-term future and how to deal with a more assertive China. Beijing has begun projecting power beyond its borders, most notably through the construction and militarization of islands in disputed areas of the South China Sea. China claims nearly the entire South China Sea, despite overlapping claims by countries including Vietnam, the Philippines, Brunei, Malaysia and Taiwan. Last week, the United States disinvited China from the Rim of the Pacific exercise (RIMPAC), a major international maritime exercise to be held later this year, citing Beijing's behavior in the South China Sea. Mattis on Saturday referred to that disinvitation as an \\"initial response\\" to China, but he did not outline any additional steps that might be taken. \\"The U.S. will continue to pursue a constructive, results-oriented relationship with China, cooperating when possible and competing vigorously where...

Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: Which of the following is not considered a great Liberal: Burke, Macaulay, or Hirst? Context: The 19th-century Liberal Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone considered Burke \\"a magazine of wisdom on Ireland and America\\" and in his diary recorded: \\"Made many extracts from Burke—sometimes almost divine\\". The Radical MP and anti-Corn Law activist Richard Cobden often praised Burke's Thoughts and Details on Scarcity. The Liberal historian Lord Acton considered Burke one of the three greatest Liberals, along with William Gladstone and Thomas Babington Macaulay. Lord Macaulay recorded in his diary: \\"I have now finished reading again most of Burke's works. Admirable! The greatest man since Milton\\". The Gladstonian Liberal MP John Morley published two books on Burke (including a biography) and was influenced by Burke, including his views on prejudice. The Cobdenite Radical Francis Hirst thought Burke deserved \\"a place among English libertarians, even though of all lovers of liberty and of all reformers he was the most conservative, the least abstract, always anxious to preserve and renovate rather than to innovate. In politics he resembled the modern architect who would restore an old house instead of pulling it down to construct a new one on the site\\".

Liszt wanted to learn more about instrumentation and acknowledged Raff's greater expertise in this area. Hence, he gave Raff piano sketches to orchestrate, just as he had done earlier with Conradi—\\"so that he might rehearse them, reflect on them, and then, as his confidence in the orchestra grew, change them.\\" Raff disagreed, having the impression that Liszt wanted him on equal terms as a full collaborator. While attending an 1850 rehearsal of Prometheus, he told Bernhard Cossmann, who sat next to him, \\"Listen to the instrumentation. It is by me.\\"Raff continued making such claims about his role in Liszt's compositional process. Some of these accounts, published posthumously by Die Musik in 1902 and 1903, suggest that he was an equal collaborator with Liszt.

What a difference a year makes. At the beginning of April last year, Sir Alex Ferguson’s Manchester United headed into the derby at Old Trafford 15 points clear of Manchester City. On Tuesday evening, it is Manuel Pellegrini’s City who will stroll into their neighbours’ backyard with a strut of arrogance, knowing United’s status has been diminished to that of inferiors. This time it is they who sit in the ascendency, 12 points ahead of David Moyes’ ailing side. A win would convert 12 into 15. Damning: Our graphic shows years of United dominance, with the difference in points between the two sides going into Old Trafford derbies heavily in their favour, but the pendulum appears to have swung. Bubble's burst: David Moyes will be desperate to beat Manchester City at Old Trafford on Tuesday night. Saviour? Wayne Rooney scores his wonder goal against West Ham last weekend. Focus: Manchester City's players look fired up in their training session ahead of the derby at Old Trafford. Two more victories in City’s games in hand on United and the gap would become 21. It is a prospect barely worth thinking about for those at Old Trafford, offering a frightening snapshot of just how far United have plummeted in the post-Ferguson era. Yet there would also be little surprise if United were to surrender once more. After all, they have won just one match in 12 against the top nine in the Barclays Premier League this season, losing seven of those. It is not difficult to see, therefore, why City are the bookmakers’ favourites to win a match at Old Trafford for the first time since the inception of the Premier League. City have inflicted the odd flesh wound in the past, of course. Kevin Keegan’s side, with Jon Macken up front rather than Sergio Aguero, as the main man beat United 4-1 at the City of Manchester Stadium in 2004. More cuttingly, there was that 6-1. two years ago at Old Trafford, leaving Ferguson ‘shattered’ after the. ‘worst result in my history, ever’. And then there was the last-gasp. Aguero goal to snatch the title from United in the most dramatic manner. possible. These were. body-blows to the United system but they were swiftly corrected, first. through the signing of Robin van Persie, ahead of City, and. then by reclaiming the title in Ferguson’s final season. Blip? Shaun Goater scores for Manchester City in the 3-1 win at Maine Road in 2002. Unprecedented: Trevor Sinclair celebrates back in 2004 during the 4-1 rout of their rivals. Old rivalry: City fans goad then opposition manager Sir Alex Ferguson in the 2004 victory. It's been 44 years since Manchester City beat United in three consecutive league matches. City could break this run if they win at Old Trafford on Wednesday. The Blues won 2-1 at Old Trafford last April before battering David Moyes' side 4-1 in his first derby at the Etihad in September. So, can they make it three on the bounce once again? It is a very long time indeed since United were last unequivocally considered the weaker force in Manchester and that should be a serious concern within the walls of Old Trafford. Certainly, it has never been the case in the Premier League era. Indeed, only twice before have United entered a Manchester derby at home in the Premier League trailing City on points. Before the 6-1 in 2012, City were two points ahead of Ferguson’s side but that was after just eight games. The only other occasion was an anomaly, in September 2005, when United were one point behind Stuart Pearce’s City. City had played four games to United three, meaning that particular statistic was rather skewed. Another rout: City hammered United at the Etihad earlier this season with Sergio Aguero scoring. Not you again: Aguero struck the winner at Old Trafford last season with a powerful effort after a nice run. Relief for United: Aguero has been ruled out of Tuesday's derby with a hamstring injury. The turnaround can perhaps be more readily attributed to United’s decline than City’s development in this past year. Intriguingly, for all the calmness instilled by their phlegmatic manager, City are only four points better off than they were after 28 games last season. United, by contrast, are 26 points worse off than they were at the same stage last season. All things considered, it does not require much this season to be more formidable than Moyes’ side. Big-game player: Yaya Toure has been in exceptional form of late for City. Unstoppable: Rooney scores a tremendous overhead kick against City in 2011. Tormentor: Rooney has a penchant for scoring against City in Manchester derbies. But we should not forget that is new territory for City supporters, for the first time indisputably the dominant outfit. Previously, this would be the stuff of printed T-shirts. Now, it is par for the course. This can be rammed home if Pellegrini’s side secure a third consecutive league victory at Old Trafford on Tuesday night. That has not happened for more than 40 years, when City won five games in a row at the home of United between 1967 and 1972. Another enemy: Steven Gerrard celebrates after scoring against Manchester United. Sore sight: Luis Suarez netted Liverpool's third at Old Trafford on a dismal day for United fans. It would be the latest of a succession of records to topple under Moyes and fresh on the back of a 3-0 humiliation by Liverpool, defeat against City would provide compelling evidence that the tide has turned irretrievably in Manchester. Dropping below City or Liverpool is one thing, to fall below the two is another thing entirely. But that is the unacceptable reality that the rank-and-file at Old Trafford may be just obliged to accept come Tuesday evening at The Theatre of Dreams. Bygone era: Francis Lee (left) was part of a Manchester City team that dominated United for a period. Glory days: City fans run on the pitch at Old Trafford in 1974 after Denis Law's goal relegated United. Highlights:","output":"1. Manchester City is expected to dominate the upcoming derby against Manchester United on Tuesday evening, with both teams in vastly different positions compared to a year ago. 2.

Summarize this article: A research organization is growing human skin in the hope of using it to trial cosmetics and medicines, reducing the need for animal testing. The synthetic skin is made using cells from infant foreskins.            The idea of a \\"skin factory\\" may sound sinister, but that is exactly what scientists at the Fraunhofer Institute in Stuttgart have created. Their so-calledgrows tiny swatches of skin - not for skin grafts, but for testing consumer products.The renowned institute is presenting their ground-breaking invention as an affordable and sustainable alternative to animal testing, which many consider unnecessarily cruel.The skin factory is a machine measuring seven metres long, three metres high and three metres deep, sealed and heated to 37 degrees Celsius – the same temperature as inside people.The machine is fitted with 500 boards, each with 24 tissue cultures growing on it in little tube formations. In each tube, extremely thin skin samples grow from cells, which robotic hands have painstakingly extracted from foreskins donated to the project. Scientists use enzymes to detach the very top layer of cells from the skin, along with connective tissue and pigment cells.The foreskin used for the process is only taken from boys up to the age of four. “The older skin is, the worse the cells function,” explained Andreas Traube, an engineer at the institute's department of production technology and automation.“It is also important that the cells we use are coming from a uniform source,\\" said Traube. \\"This avoids discrepancies in the production of the new skin.\\"The equipment developed by the Fraunhofer team can extract between three to 10 million cells from a single foreskin. In the incubator these cells then multiply hundreds of times.The brand new skin cells are mixed with collagen and connective tissue, which then becomes ‘proper’ skin, measuring up to five millimetres in thickness. The whole process can take up to six weeks, but according to Traube, “We can’t use the machine to speed up the process; biology needs time to take its course.”In a single month, the machine can produce around 5,000 skin samples. For now, these delicate creations remain untouched as the process is still being authorized by European authorities, who are examining the growths to see whether they are suitable to be used in testing.But the process has been given the nod of approval by some key members of the Association of Research-based Pharmaceutical Companies (VFA).“I think the idea is a good one,” said Rolf Hömke, VFA spokesman. “I believe cells from artificially cultivated skin are indeed comparable with real skin.”“I do think it might take a few years to get up and running though,” warned Hömke. “There are complicated international safety standards, these procedures can’t just be changed overnight.”At the moment only very small skin samples are being created. “It’s logical that we’d want to take the operation to a bigger scale,” said Traube.He added that possible future applications for products from thecould be research into cancer, pigmentation diseases, allergic reactions and fungal infections.The next step for the company is a little smaller though, as their sights are set on synthesizing a human cornea. ||||| Researchers at the Fraunhofer Institute in Stuttgart recently created the \\"Skin Factory,\\" an advanced piece of lab equipment designed to use foreskin taken from babies to grow patches of human skin that can be used in the place of animals to test products, the German Herald reported.      According to a spokesman for the Institute, the groundbreaking equipment may be able to eliminate animal testing altogether and, if developed on a larger scale, could be useful in developing treatments for cancer, pigmentation diseases, and certain skin allergies.      So how does the miracle machine work? First, it's heated to roughly 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit, the temperature of the human body, according to the German news outlet The Local. Next, robotic hands meticulously extract cells from foreskins donated to the project, all samples of which must come from boys age four-and-under.      \\"The older skin is, the worse the cells function,\\" Andreas Traube, an engineer at the institute.      Scientists then take the cells extracted from the foreskin (one sample can provide up to 10 million cells) and incubate them inside tubes, where they multiply hundreds of times. The cells are then mixed with collagen and connective tissue to create skin about 5 millimeters thick. All in all, Traube explained, the process takes about six weeks -- about the same amount of time it takes skin to grow naturally.      \\"We can't use the machine to speed up the process; biology needs time to take its course,\\" Traube told the The Local.      At least one organization within Germany has already expressed measured approval for the machine.      \\"I think the idea is a good one. I believe cells from artificially cultivated skin are indeed comparable with real skin,\\" Rolf Homke, spokesman for the German Association of Research-based Pharmaceutical Companies, told The Local. \\"I do think it might take a few years to get up and running though.

Article: One day, a man found the cocoon   of a butterfly and he brought it home. A few days later, the man saw a small hole in the cocoon. He sat and watched for several hours as a butterfly struggled to force its body through that little hole. Then it stopped. So the man decided to help the butterfly. He took a knife and cut a bigger hole in the cocoon. The butterfly came out of the cocoon but it had a weak body and small, thin wings. The butterfly didn't start to fly. In fact, the butterfly spent the rest of its life crawling  around with a weak body and thin wings. It was never able to fly. The man acted with kindness but he didn't understand that he had done something wrong. When a butterfly crawls out of the cocoon, it must struggle. The hard work of getting out of the cocoon forces the fluid  from the butterfly's body into wings. It helps the butterfly be ready to fly. If the butterfly never has to force itself out of the cocoon, its wings never get the fluid and it can never fly. Sometimes struggles are exactly what we need in our lives. If we lived our lives without any problems, we would never learn or grow. We would not be as strong as we could have been and we would never fly. So, the next time you are faced with a challenge or a problem, remember the butterfly. Struggle a little - then fly! Question: What does the writer want to tell us?

Q:Information:  - An aircraft carrier is a warship that serves as a seagoing airbase, equipped with a full-length flight deck and facilities for carrying, arming, deploying, and recovering aircraft. Typically, it is the capital ship of a fleet, as it allows a naval force to project air power worldwide without depending on local bases for staging aircraft operations. Aircraft carriers are expensive to build and are critical assets. Carriers have evolved since their inception in the early twentieth century from wooden vessels used to deploy balloons to nuclear-powered warships that carry numerous fighter planes, strike aircraft, helicopters, and other types of aircraft.   - Colombia (or ), officially the Republic of Colombia, is a transcontinental country largely situated in the northwest of South America, with territories in Central America. Colombia shares a border to the northwest with Panama, to the east with Venezuela and Brazil and to the south with Ecuador and Peru. It shares its maritime limits with Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras, Jamaica, the Dominican Republic and Haiti. It is a unitary, constitutional republic comprising thirty-two departments. The territory of what is now Colombia was originally inhabited by indigenous peoples including the Muisca, the Quimbaya and the Tairona.  - Birds (Aves), also known as avian dinosaurs, are a group of endothermic vertebrates, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a lightweight but strong skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the bee hummingbird to the ostrich. They rank as the class of tetrapods with the most living species, at approximately ten thousand, with more than half of these being passerines, sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds.  - A gill is a respiratory organ found in many aquatic organisms that extracts dissolved oxygen from water and excretes carbon dioxide. The gills of some species, such as hermit crabs, have adapted to allow respiration on land provided they are kept moist. The microscopic structure of a gill presents a large surface area to the external environment.  - A reserve fleet is a collection of naval vessels of all types that are fully equipped for service but are not currently needed, and thus partially or fully decommissioned. A reserve fleet is informally said to be \\"in mothballs\\" or \\"mothballed\\"; an equivalent expression in unofficial modern U.S. naval usage is \\"ghost fleet\\". In earlier times, and especially in British usage, these ships were said to be \\"laid up in ordinary\\".  - An aircraft is a machine that is able to fly by gaining support from the air. It counters the force of gravity by using either static lift or by using the dynamic lift of an airfoil, or in a few cases the downward thrust from jet engines.  - A fish is any member of a group of organisms that consist of all gill-bearing aquatic craniate animals that lack limbs with digits. They form a sister group to the tunicates, together forming the olfactores. Included in this definition are the living hagfish, lampreys, and cartilaginous and bony fish as well as various extinct related groups. Tetrapods emerged within lobe-finned fishes, so cladistically they are fish as well. However, traditionally fish are rendered obsolete or paraphyletic by excluding the tetrapods (i.e., the amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals which all descended from within the same ancestry). Because in this manner the term \\"fish\\" is defined negatively as a paraphyletic group, it is not considered a formal taxonomic grouping in systematic biology. The traditional term pisces (also ichthyes) is considered a typological, but not a phylogenetic classification.  - Amphibians are ectothermic, tetrapod vertebrates of the class Amphibia. Modern amphibians are all Lissamphibia. They inhabit a wide variety of habitats, with most species living within terrestrial, fossorial, arboreal or freshwater aquatic ecosystems. Thus amphibians typically start out as larvae living in water, but some species have developed behavioural adaptations to bypass this. The young generally undergo metamorphosis from larva with gills to an adult air-breathing form with lungs. Amphibians use their skin as a secondary respiratory surface and some small terrestrial salamanders and frogs lack lungs and rely entirely on their skin. They are superficially similar to lizards but, along with mammals and birds, reptiles are amniotes and do not require water bodies in which to breed. With their complex reproductive needs and permeable skins, amphibians are often ecological indicators; in recent decades there has been a dramatic decline in amphibian populations for many species around the globe.  - The winghead shark (\\"Eusphyra blochii\\") is a species of hammerhead shark, and part of the family Sphyrnidae. Reaching a length of , this small brown to gray shark has a slender body with a tall, sickle-shaped first dorsal fin. Its name comes from its exceptionally large \\"hammer\\", or cephalofoil, which can be as wide as half of the shark's total length. The function of this structure is unclear but may relate to the shark's senses. The wide spacing of its eyes grants superb binocular vision, while the extremely long nostrils on the leading margin of the cephalofoil may allow for better detection and tracking of odor trails in the water. The cephalofoil also provides a large surface area for its ampullae of Lorenzini and lateral line, with potential benefits for electroreception and mechanoreception respectively.  - Costa Rica (literally meaning \\"Rich Coast\\"), officially the Republic of Costa Rica, is a country in Central America, bordered by Nicaragua to the north, Panama to the southeast, the Pacific Ocean to the west, the Caribbean Sea to the east, and Ecuador to the south of Cocos Island. It has a population of around 4.5 million, of whom nearly a quarter live in the metropolitan area of the capital and largest city, San José.  - Lampreys (sometimes also called, inaccurately, lamprey eels) are any jawless fish of the order Petromyzontiformes, placed in the superclass Cyclostomata. The adult lamprey may be characterized by a toothed, funnel-like sucking mouth. The common name \\"lamprey\\" is probably derived from Latin \\"lampetra\\", which may mean \\"stone licker\\" (\\"lambere\\" \\"to lick\\" + \\"petra\\" \\"stone\\"), though the etymology is uncertain.  - Malpelo is a small island in the East Pacific Ocean, located about west of the Colombian mainland. Except for a small military post that is manned by the Colombian Armed Forces, it is uninhabited. It consists of a sheer and barren rock with three high peaks, the highest being \\"Cerro de la Mona\\" with a height of . The island is about one mile in length from northeast to southwest, and 700 yards in width.  - The United States Navy (USN) is the naval warfare service branch of the United States Armed Forces and one of the seven uniformed services of the United States. The U.S. Navy is the largest, most capable navy in the world, with the highest combined battle fleet tonnage. The U.S. Navy has the world's largest aircraft carrier fleet, with ten in service, two in the reserve fleet, and three new carriers under construction. The service has 323,792 personnel on active duty and 108,515 in the Navy Reserve. It has 274 deployable combat vessels and more than 3,700 aircraft in active service .  - The United States Armed Forces are the federal armed forces of the United States. They consist of the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard. The President of the United States is the military's overall head, and helps form military policy with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), a federal executive department, acting as the principal organ by which military policy is carried out. From the time of its inception, the military played a decisive role in the history of the United States. A sense of national unity and identity was forged as a result of victory in the First Barbary War and the Second Barbary War. Even so, the Founders were suspicious of a permanent military force. It played an important role in the American Civil War, where leading generals on both sides were picked from members of the United States military. Not until the outbreak of World War II did a large standing army become officially established. The National Security Act of 1947, adopted following World War II and during the Cold War's onset, created the modern U.S. military framework; the Act merged previously Cabinet-level Department of War and the Department of the Navy into the National Military Establishment (renamed the Department of Defense in 1949), headed by the Secretary of Defense; and created the Department of the Air Force and National Security Council.  - A fin is a thin component or appendage attached to a larger body or structure. Fins typically function as foils that produce lift or thrust, or provide the ability to steer or stabilize motion while traveling in water, air, or other fluid media. Fins are also used to increase surface areas for heat transfer purposes, or simply as ornamentation.  - Molokai or Molokai (Hawaiian: ), often called the \\"Friendly Island\\", is an island in the Hawaiian archipelago. It is 38 by 10 miles (61 by 16 km) in size at its extreme length and width with a usable land area of , making it the fifth-largest of the main Hawaiian Islands and the 27th largest island in the United States. It lies east of Oahu across the 25-mile (40 km) wide Kaiwi Channel and north of Lnai, separated from it by the Kalohi Channel.  - Hawaii is the 50th and most recent state to have joined the United States of America, having received statehood on August 21, 1959. Hawaii is the only U.S. state located in Oceania and the only one composed entirely of islands. It is the northernmost island group in Polynesia, occupying most of an archipelago in the central Pacific Ocean. Hawaii is the only U.S. state not located in the Americas.  - Cocos Island is an island designated as a National Park off the shore of Costa Rica, that does not allow inhabitants other than Costa Rican Park Rangers. It constitutes the 11th of the 13 districts of Puntarenas Canton of the province of Puntarenas. It is located in the Pacific Ocean, approximately from the Pacific shore of Costa Rica. With an area of approximately , about and a perimeter of around , this island is more or less rectangular in shape.  - Naval warfare is combat in and on the sea, the ocean, or any other major body of water such as a large lake or wide river.  - A tunicate is a marine invertebrate animal, a member of the subphylum Tunicata, which is part of the Chordata, a phylum which includes all animals with dorsal nerve cords and notochords. The subphylum was at one time called Urochordata, and the term urochordates is still sometimes used for these animals. Some tunicates live as solitary individuals, but others replicate by budding and become colonies, each unit being known as a zooid. They are marine filter feeders with a water-filled, sac-like body structure and two tubular openings, known as siphons, through which they draw in and expel water. During their respiration and feeding, they take in water through the incurrent (or inhalant) siphon and expel the filtered water through the excurrent (or exhalant) siphon. Most adult tunicates are sessile, and are permanently attached to rocks or other hard surfaces on the ocean floor; others, such as salps, doliolids and pyrosomes, swim in the pelagic zone of the sea as adults. Various species are commonly known as sea squirts, sea pork, sea livers, or sea tulips.  - The United States of America has seven federal uniformed services that commission officers as defined by Title 10, and subsequently structured and organized by Title 10, Title 14, Title 32 and Title 42 of the United States Code.  - USS Hammerhead ( SSN - 663 ) , a Sturgeon - class submarine , was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for the hammerhead shark , a voracious fish found in warm seas , with a curious hammerlike head .  - In cryptography, SHARK is a block cipher identified as one of the predecessors of Rijndael (the Advanced Encryption Standard).  - The superclass Tetrapoda (Ancient Greek s tetrapods, \\"four-footed\\"), or the tetrapods , comprises the first four-limbed vertebrates and their descendants, including the living and extinct amphibians, birds, mammals, reptiles and some ancient, exclusively aquatic creatures such as the Acanthostega. Tetrapods evolved from the lobe-finned fishes around 390 million years ago in the middle Devonian Period, with modern tetrapod groups having appeared by the late Devonian, 367.5 million years ago. The specific aquatic ancestors of the tetrapods, and the process by which land colonization occurred, remain unclear, and are areas of active research and debate among palaeontologists at present.  - The hammerhead sharks are a group of sharks in the family Sphyrnidae, so named for the unusual and distinctive structure of their heads, which are flattened and laterally extended into a \\"hammer\\" shape called a cephalofoil. Most hammerhead species are placed in the genus Sphyrna while the winghead shark is placed in its own genus, Eusphyra. Many not necessarily mutually exclusive functions have been proposed for the cephalofoil, including sensory reception, manoeuvering, and prey manipulation. Hammerheads are found worldwide in warmer waters along coastlines and continental shelves. Unlike most sharks, hammerheads usually swim in schools during the day, becoming solitary hunters at night. Some of these schools can be found near Malpelo Island in Colombia, Cocos Island off Costa Rica, and near Molokai in Hawaii. Large schools are also seen in the waters off southern and eastern Africa.    What object entity has the relation of 'named after' with the subject 'uss hammerhead '?

Article: Anxiety may cause people to neglect their physical or emotional health, and you can help by suggesting that she do something if you notice she has forgotten. Self-soothing activities may be especially important if she has frequent anxiety. For example, ask her if she would like to get something to eat or suggest that she take a warm, long bath.  When dealing with children, engage in relaxing activities together. Let them pick what they want to do. Not everyone with anxiety will have an anxiety disorder but that doesn’t mean it doesn’t need to be dealt with. Set aside 30 minutes out of the day, where your loved one can just have a good worry. During this time, don’t let him be distracted by anything other than worrying and feeling anxious. Encourage him to think of solutions to his problems. This technique is effective with children as well as adults and helps them gain a sense of control over their problems. Your loved one may tell you why she feels upset, or you may have been able to tell based on what set off the anxiety. Try saying how upset she looks, and recognize that this is hard. This lets her know that you care, and that you think her struggles are valid. Ironically, affirming her stress can reduce it.  \\"That sounds really hard.\\" \\"I can see why that would be upsetting to you. It sounds like visiting your father can be difficult for you sometimes.\\" \\"You look stressed. Your face is scrunched up and you look hunched over. Do you want to talk about it?\\" Hugs can bring comfort to an anxious person. You may try to pat his back, give him a one-armed hug or put your arm around his shoulder to make him comfortable. Only do what you and he are comfortable with. Always give him opportunities to decline. If he is dealing with sensory overload or are autistic, touch may make things worse. Or he may not be in the mood. This can be an enormous relief to the anxious person. Be accommodating, and don't question her bad days or unusual needs. Treat her anxiety like a fact that, while unfortunate, is not a dreadful burden upon your life. Recognize that her feelings matter, and treat her with compassion, anxiety and all. Be flexible. It may take longer for people with anxiety problems to get ready for events such as getting ready for school. Factor in this time and allow for delays. If your loved one isn't being treated already, seeing a doctor about his anxiety may allow him to get the help he needs. It’s important to rule out any underlying medical or biological causes of the anxiety. Once you know that the cause of  your loved one’s anxiety is psychological, you will be in a better position to seek treatment. To give him a boost, you might suggest accompanying him to take notes, help him remember symptoms, or just for moral support. Asking others for help can be very encouraging for a person with anxiety problems. In fact, persons with strong informal support networks have increase their chances of benefitting from treatment for anxiety.  You don’t have to do anything specific. Just knowing that there are people around with whom to talk to and share her worries with, can help a person with anxiety problems feel better. What is a summary of what this article is about?","output":"The article discusses the importance of understanding, supporting, and helping individuals dealing with anxiety. It suggests various practical techniques to offer assistance and comfort, such as engaging in self-soothing activities, setting aside time for worrying, providing validation, offering physical comfort through touch (when appropriate), being flexible, seeking professional help, and building a strong support network.

Answer the following question: This is a correct answer to the following question about Beowulf (hero). Yes or no? Answer: Beowulf (; Old English : ) is a legendary Geatish hero and later turned king in the epic poem named after him , one of the oldest surviving pieces of literature in the English language. Question: what is the name of beowulf's king Answer:","output":"The name of Beowulf's king is King Hrothgar.  King Hrothgar is the ruler of the Danes in the epic poem Beowulf and is an important secondary character in the story. Hrothgar is portrayed as a wise and experienced leader who seeks the help of the Geatish warrior Beowulf in dealing with the monster Grendel, a creature terrorizing the kingdom of Denmark.  Hrothgar's kingdom has been under the scourge of Grendel for twelve years when Beowulf, a hero from the land of the Geats, arrives. Beowulf offers his assistance to rid Denmark of the monster and protect its people. Hrothgar, as a grateful king, accepts Beowulf's help with open arms and holds feasts in honor of his bravery. After Beowulf successfully defeats Grendel and his mother, Hrothgar rewards Beowulf for his heroic deeds, bestowing great treasures and wisdom upon him. The two develop a strong bond and mutual respect despite their cultural differences, illustrating the epic's underlying themes of heroism, loyalty, and friendship. King Hrothgar is an essential figure in the epic poem Beowulf, as he represents a wise and compassionate ruler who seeks to protect his people from harm. His relationship with Beowulf serves as a crucial point in the story, demonstrating the importance of cooperation and valuing the skills and courage of others, irrespective of their origins. Hrothgar's character also effectively highlights the impact of strong leadership in fostering peace and prosperity within a kingdom."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Much like the Grand Old Duke of York, who had ten thousand men and marched them up to the top of the hill, and then marched them down again, I can’t get enough of York… (because he visited repeatedly, that was obvious, right?) Having visited nearly half a dozen times over the years, and somehow not managing to share it on my blog over the years, I would say that although you could visit from London for the day, I wouldn’t. Go for a minimum of an overnight stay, or a few days if you can. Witness a misty morning, and a candy coloured sunset, wander out into the Dales or slip in a seaside visit somewhere like Scarborough, and really get to know the ancient city. Alas, I haven’t really learned how to take my own advice, but hot on the end of a family visit in Lincolnshire we were lucky enough to spend sometime with one of my favourite expats on Yorkshire (ok, ok, I only know two, but they are definitely in the top two of that limited ranking system). It was of course Amanda, her fabulous husband Sam and we got to meet their gorgeous new addition to the family, a mischevious Dachshund pup who goes by the name of Harold. Instagram was alive with “OOOOOOOH MY GOD YOU GOT TO MEET HAROLLLLLD” Forget being a rockstar in this day and age, puppy dog eyes are all you need to make ladies weep and then squeal into their keyboards. We tumbled off the train, cheeks ruddy from the fresh the North Sea breezes (fresh from visiting the Seal colony with a litany of pups at Donna Nook, and nibbling fish and chips with the family in Cleethorpes) and went wandering. I’m going to make a big claim here – if you’re travelling through the UK and can only fit in one city visit outside of London, York or perhaps Bath would be excellent choices. Compact enough to really explore, full of ancient buildings and history, and good cake. What more do you even need? When did the writer meet Harold?

It was released on record label Universal Music Australia on 21 August 2000 as the first single from the band's fourth album, Odyssey Number Five. The single is Powderfinger's most successful; it peaked at number four on the Australian ARIA Singles Chart, and charted in the United States on the Hot Modern Rock Tracks chart--the first Powderfinger song to do so. Powderfinger frontman Bernard Fanning wrote the lyrics for \\"My Happiness\\" as a reflection on the time the band spent touring to promote their work, and the loneliness that came as a result. \\"My Happiness\\" was put on heavy rotation by Los Angeles radio station KROQ-FM two months prior to its United States release, and Powderfinger signed a contract with United States label Republic as a result of the song's early success. Beat journalist Jayson Argall joked the song had received \\"a bit\\" of airplay. Although \\"My Happiness\\" was subsequently dropped from KROQ's roster, other radio stations continued to give the song high priority.  \\"My Happiness\\" peaked at number 23 on the Hot Modern Rock Tracks, making it the first Powderfinger song to appear on a Billboard chart. According to Susan Groves of WHRL, part of the song's success came about because very few people knew of Powderfinger, but were drawn towards \\"My Happiness\\" because it was \\"melodic, [and] pretty\\"--a change from what she described as \\"middle of the road rock\\" popular in the United States. Meanwhile, Australians were \\"starting to get sick of My Happiness\\"--Cameron Adams argued in The Hobart Mercury that this was one of the reasons Powderfinger decided to focus on the offshore market.  Powderfinger performed \\"My Happiness\\" live on the Late Show with David Letterman while touring North America with British rock group Coldplay. They were the fourth Australian act (after The Living End, Silverchair, and Nick Cave) to play on the show. The band also did free promotional shows leading up to the release of the single. In Europe, \\"My Happiness\\" received approximately four weeks of airplay on German music video program Viva II, and the band sold out for three nights in a row in London, partly due to the success of the single. Are there any interesting aspects about this article?","output":"There are several interesting aspects about this article: 1. \\"My Happiness\\" stands out as Powderfinger's most successful single, not only in Australia but also charted in the United States on the Hot Modern Rock Tracks chart, making it the first song by the band to do so. 2. The song was written by Powderfinger frontman Bernard Fanning, reflecting on the band's experience of touring and the loneliness resulting from it, which adds an emotional background to the song. 3. The single gained early traction in the United States due to heavy rotation by Los Angeles radio station KROQ-FM, even before its official release in the country. This early success led the band to sign a contract with US label Republic. 4. Susan Groves of WHRL suggested that part of \\"My Happiness's\\" success was due to its melodic and pretty sound, which contrasted with the \\"middle of the road rock\\" that was popular in the United States at the time. 5. Powderfinger focused on the offshore market partly because Australians were starting to get tired of \\"My Happiness,\\" as mentioned by Cameron Adams in The Hobart Mercury. 6. While touring North America with British rock group Coldplay, Powderfinger performed \\"My Happiness\\" live on the Late Show with David Letterman, making them the fourth Australian act to play on the show. 7. In Europe, the single received around four weeks of airplay on German music video program Viva II and contributed to the band selling out three nights in a row in London. These aspects highlight the song's popularity, its impact on Powderfinger's career, and the international recognition it achieved for the band."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Q:Background: During late adulthood, the risk of developing diseases such as cardiovascular diseases and cancer continues to rise. Most people also have a decline in strength and stamina. Their senses may start failing, and their reflex time typically increases. Their immune system also doesn’t work as well as it used to. As a result, common diseases like the flu may become more serious and even lead to death. The majority of late adults develop arthritis, and as many as one in four develop Alzheimer’s disease.  Paragraph: Robert and his son Michael are going to the doctor for their yearly physical. Robert is currently in the late adulthood phase of his life. Michael, on the other hand, just began adulthood and is still quite young. Both of them want to ask the doctor about their risks for future health problems.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Who is less likely to develop a cardiovascular disease? A:","output":"Given the information provided, Michael is less likely to develop a cardiovascular disease compared to his father, Robert. This conclusion is based on the fact that the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases and many other health conditions increases with age.  In terms of life stage, Robert is in late adulthood, a phase which is often marked by an increased susceptibility to health problems. With age, many elements of the human body start to degrade including the cardiovascular system. Arteries may harden and narrow over time due to a condition called atherosclerosis, which significantly boosts the risk for cardiovascular diseases. Furthermore, the immune system in older adults doesn't work as effectively as it once did, making them more prone to illnesses and diseases.  On the contrary, Michael has just entered adulthood. During this stage of life, the risk of suffering from cardiovascular diseases or other major health conditions is typically much lower, provided the individual maintains a reasonably healthy lifestyle. The cardiovascular system in younger adults tends to be healthier with less plaque buildup in the arteries. The immune system in this phase is also generally stronger, offering better protection against infections and diseases. However, it is critical to note that although the given background suggests a higher probability for Robert to develop cardiovascular diseases, it doesn't exclude Michael from the risk entirely. Factors like genetics, lifestyle choices, and environmental influences can significantly impact an individual's health at any age. Therefore, both should engage in regular check-ups and maintain a healthy lifestyle to reduce their risks as much as possible. In conclusion, while Michael is statistically less likely to develop cardiovascular diseases compared to Robert due to their respective ages, both individuals still carry some level of risk."},{"instruction":"Information:  - The Southern African Development Community (SADC) is an inter-governmental organization headquartered in Gaborone, Botswana.

Instead, Francesco Schettino \\"jumped into the lifeboat,\\" Stefano Iannelli said.  Schettino is on trial in Grosseto on charges of manslaughter and abandoning ship after 32 people died in the shipwreck off the Tuscan island of Giglio on January 13, 2012.  Iannelli, who was on the bridge when the ship hit the outcropping, testified that Schettino's reaction was, \\"What have I done?!\\"  As part of his defense for the abandoning ship charge, Schettino has maintained that by the time he left the crippled vessel, the inclination made it impossible to stay on the ship. He told the court at a hearing in October that the ship was literally falling on top of him and he fell into the lifeboat. The ship ended up lying on its side.  INTERACTIVE: How ill-fated cruise liner was raised from Italian seabed  Iannelli, who followed Schettino off the ship, testified Monday that he did not see passengers when they left the vessel, even though more than 1,000 people were later rescued from the ship. In a taped conversation between the captain and the port authority in Livorno, the port authority ordered Schettino to \\"get back on board\\" while passengers were still being rescued from the other side of the ship.  Schettino, who admits that he was in command when the ship veered off course and hit the rocks, also blames a malfunction of the ship's watertight doors for making the situation worse.

What creature is portrayed on the Victoria Cross?","output":"The Victoria Cross is the highest military honor awarded to members of the British and Commonwealth armed forces for acts of conspicuous gallantry, extraordinary bravery, and self-sacrifice in the face of extreme danger. It was instituted by Queen Victoria in a Royal Warrant on 29 January 1856 during the Crimean War and remains the most prestigious military decoration in the United Kingdom, as well as in many Commonwealth countries. The creature portrayed on the Victoria Cross is a lion, specifically a rampant lion. A rampant lion is a heraldic symbol that denotes a lion standing on its hind legs with its forepaws raised. This posture of the lion signifies strength, courage, and valiance—qualities that the recipients of the Victoria Cross must possess to be deemed worthy of this esteemed accolade. The design of the Victoria Cross consists of a Maltese Cross made from bronze and measuring approximately 1.375 inches (34.9 mm) across. The bronze used in making the medals is traditionally obtained from the metal of Russian guns captured during the Crimean War, adding a historical and symbolic connection to its recipients' unmatched heroism. The obverse of the Victoria Cross bears the lion on top of the royal crown, and the lion is passant guardant, which means it is walking with one forepaw raised and its head facing forward. The lion on the Victoria Cross is encircled by a scroll-like structure that displays the inscription \\"FOR VALOUR\\". This phrase was chosen by Queen Victoria herself after rejecting the initial suggestion of \\"FOR BRAVERY,\\" as she believed that soldiers of the British armed forces were inherently brave, and only those who had displayed extraordinary levels of valor would deserve this recognition. On the reverse side of the Victoria Cross, a circular panel displays the recipient's rank, name, and unit, along with the date of the act of valor for which they are receiving the award. Suspended from a crimson ribbon, the medal is worn on the left side of the recipient's chest above all other decorations and medals, signifying its position as the highest honor in the military order of precedence. The image of the lion is not unique to the Victoria Cross and has been a recurring symbol throughout British history, particularly in heraldry, where it has long been associated with the English monarchy. As the symbol of the Victoria Cross, the lion epitomizes the renowned courage, gallantry, and selflessness that Victoria Cross recipients have consistently displayed during their service to the nation in the face of great adversity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

They go away to college or find full-time jobs, and they often rent their own apartments. Some get married and start families. This independence  is learned from childhood. From an early age, American children learn responsibility . Children as young as 2 begin to put away their toys and dress themselves. At 3, many children do simple chores like setting the table. Using money wisely is also taught early. As soon as a child understands the value of money, he or she receives a weekly _ . This is used for things the child wants, like toys or treats. The child can spend or save it, usually with little guidance  from parents. If the child wants money besides his or her allowance, it must be made by doing extra chores. Children are taught early in life to think for themselves. They are allowed to make some decisions--and make mistakes. Failure often teaches more than success. A child can get some more money by   _  . A) understanding the value of money B) helping the rich C) reading many books D) doing extra chores A:","output":"In the United States, it is quite common for young adults at the age of 18 to venture out on their own and seek independence. This custom has its roots in American culture and upbringing, where children are taught self-reliance and responsibility from a very early age. The development of these skills is crucial as it helps to shape young minds into becoming responsible and confident adults in the long run.  Starting from the age of 2, American children are encouraged to take responsibility for simple tasks such as putting away their toys and learning to dress themselves. As they grow older, around the age of 3, they are taught to complete slightly more complex chores like setting the table, which instill a sense of responsibility and pride in their accomplishments.  Another vital aspect of the American upbringing is teaching children the value of money and how to manage it wisely. Once a child grasps this concept, they usually begin receiving a weekly allowance. This allowance serves as an opportunity for children to learn how to make decisions about their finances independently, allowing them to use this money to buy things they desire, such as toys or treats. Parents may not give much guidance on how the allowance is used, enabling the child to develop their decision-making skills. With the weekly allowance, there is often an expectation that the child must earn any additional money needed beyond the allowance by undertaking extra chores or tasks. This practice teaches children the importance of working to achieve their goals and instills a strong work ethic from a young age. One key aspect of American upbringing that sets it apart from some other cultures is the emphasis on allowing children to think for themselves and make their own decisions. Consequently, they are sometimes permitted to make mistakes, as failure can often teach us more than success. By learning from their errors, children develop resilience and problem-solving skills which prove valuable in adulthood. In conclusion, American culture places a strong emphasis on cultivating independence, responsibility, and decision-making skills in children from a young age. By acquiring these attributes, young adults are better equipped to face the challenges that arise as they embark on their journey towards self-reliance. Through learning the value of money, undertaking chores, and being allowed to make mistakes, children in the United States are set on a path to personal success and, ultimately, independence."},{"instruction":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Paragraph: Milwaukee, Wisconsin (CNN) -- President Barack Obama, in a bid to create jobs and boost economic growth, called on Congress on Monday to pass a 50 billion plan to renew the country's transportation infrastructure. His address was the first of two speeches the president is scheduled to make this week to frame his administration's ongoing response to the recession, less than two months ahead of midterm elections in which Democratic majorities in the House and Senate are in jeopardy. \\"Today, I am announcing a new plan for rebuilding and modernizing America's roads, and rails and runways for the long term,\\" said Obama, who spoke on Labor Day in Milwaukee, Wisconsin -- a state with competitive gubernatorial and U.S. Senate races. \\"We used to have the best infrastructure in the world. We can have it again,\\" he said to loud cheers from a crowd of union workers. The proposal envisions -- over a six year period -- rebuilding 150,000 miles of roads, 4,000 miles of rail and 150 miles of airport runways. It also would include modernizing the nation's air traffic control system in an effort to reduce delays and travel time. \\"This will not only create jobs immediately. It's also going to make our economy hum over the long haul,\\" said the president. Obama hopes to work with Congress to enact an up-front investment of 50 billion -- an amount a White House statement said would represent a significant chunk of new spending on infrastructure. The investment would then be paired with what the administration called a framework to improve transportation spending. The long-term plan would include the establishment of an Infrastructure Bank, which would leverage federal dollars and focus on projects that could deliver the the biggest bang for the buck, Obama said. The president stressed the need for Democrats and Republicans to work together on the transportation initiative, which would need to be approved by Congress.

This means that when he rolls his melon across the _____ will experience more resistance (A) farm field (B) back yard it  Choose the answer between \\"farm field\\" and \\"back yard\\". Answer:","output":"The answer to this logic test is the back yard (B). Here's a detailed explanation: The situation presented in the question describes two areas: Mike's farm field and his back yard. The former is described as smooth, while the latter is described as rough. From this information, we can infer certain attributes that can affect the resistance experienced by the melon when rolled across either area. Resistance, in this context, refers to the opposition or difficulty faced by the melon as it moves across the surface of either area. In general, resistance can be attributed to several factors, including surface texture, friction, and obstacles. In this case, the question highlights the surface texture as the main factor influencing resistance. While rolling the melon across the farm field, the smoother surface allows for easier movement due to minimal obstacles and lower friction between the melon and the ground. The lack of roughness means that there's little interference or hindrance, and less force is needed to overcome any obstacles that may be present. Therefore, the resistance experienced by the melon on the farm field will be less. On the other hand, when the melon is rolled across the back yard, its rough surface will present greater resistance, as the uneven and irregular texture can amplify the friction between the melon and the ground. Additionally, the roughness implies a higher probability of obstacles, which the melon must overcome to continue moving. The presence of such obstacles would require more force to be exerted to achieve the same movement as on a smooth surface. As a result, the resistance experienced by the melon in the back yard will be higher. In conclusion, taking into account the characteristics and differences between the farm field's smooth surface and the back yard's rough surface, the melon will experience more resistance when rolled across the back yard (B), as opposed to the farm field (A)."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You can have fun together and make each other happy. Sometimes you will meet fair-weather friends. They will be with you as long as you have money or luck, but when you are down, they will run away. How do I know when I have found a good friend? I look for certain qualities  of character, especially understanding, honesty and reliability . Above all else, I look for understanding in a friend. A good friend tries to understand how another person is feeling. He is not quick to judge. Instead, he tries to learn from others. He puts himself in the other person's place, and he tries to think of ways to be helpful. He is also a good listener. At the same time, however, a good friend is honest. He does not look for faults  in others. He notices their good points. In short, a friend will try to understand me and accept me. Another quality of a friend is reliability. I can always depend on a good friend. If he tells me he will meet me somewhere at a certain time, I can be sure that he will be there. If I need a favor, he will do his best to help me. If I am in trouble, he will not run away from me. There is a fourth quality that makes a friend special. A special friend is someone with whom we can have fun. We should enjoy our lives, and we would enjoy our friendship. That is why I especially like friends who are fun to be with. A good friend likes the same things I like. We share experiences and learn from each other. A good friend has a good sense of humor, too. He likes to laugh with me. That is how we share in the joy of being friends. And I know that he is looking for the same quality in me. When I meet someone who is reliable, honest and understanding, I know I've found a friend!

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: When was the Chicxulub crater discovered? ?  The Chicxulub crater (; Mayan: [tʃʼikʃuluɓ]) is an impact crater buried underneath the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico. Its center is located near the town of Chicxulub, after which the crater is named. It was formed by a large asteroid or comet about 11 to 81 kilometres (6.8 to 50.3 miles) in diameter, the Chicxulub impactor, striking the Earth. The date of the impact coincides precisely with the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary (K–Pg boundary), slightly less than 66 million years ago, and a widely accepted theory is that worldwide climate disruption from the event was the cause of the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, a mass extinction in which 75% of plant and animal species on Earth became extinct, including all non-avian dinosaurs. The crater is estimated to be 150 kilometres (93 miles) in diameter and 20 km (12 mi) in depth, well into the continental crust of the region of about 10–30 km (6.2–18.6 mi) depth. It is the second largest confirmed impact structure on Earth and the only one whose peak ring is intact and directly accessible for scientific research.The crater was discovered by Antonio Camargo and Glen Penfield, geophysicists who had been looking for petroleum in the Yucatán during the late 1970s. Penfield was initially unable to obtain evidence that the geological feature was a crater and gave up his search. Later, through contact with Alan Hildebrand in 1990, Penfield obtained samples that suggested it was an impact feature. Evidence for the impact origin of the crater includes shocked quartz, a gravity anomaly, and tektites in surrounding areas. In 2016, a scientific drilling project drilled deep into the peak ring of the impact crater, hundreds of meters below the current sea floor, to obtain rock core samples from the impact itself. The discoveries were widely seen as confirming current theories related to both the crater impact and its effects.","output":"The Chicxulub crater was discovered during the late 1970s by Antonio Camargo and Glen Penfield, who were geophysicists searching for petroleum in the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico.

Q: In this task, you will be shown a prompt from a judicial decision and multiple holding statements derived from citations following text in a legal decision.

The correct answer is the holding statement that corresponds to the citing text. The four incorrect answers are other holding statements. You should find the correct option.

Thus, to the extent there is a “presumption” regarding survival of a contractual obligation after the death of one of the parties, it is exactly the converse of that advanced by the Estate and adopted by the trial court.

A number of  popular musicians - including Jimi Hendrix and Kurt Cobain - have died at the age of 27. In the past six decades homicide rates were up to eight times greater amongst musicians than the US population. Female musicians tend to die in their early 60s rather than their 80s.

However, recent research by Sydney University highlights a darker side to the lives of musicians, including shorter lifespans, and increased suicide and homicide rates. This disturbing trend begs the question: does the music industry do enough to support and protect its stars? Shorter Lifespans and Rising Homicide Rates The groundbreaking study, conducted by Professor Dianna Kenny, delved into the lives of 12,665 deceased musicians and singers across various popular genres between 1950 and 2014. These statistics uncovered the shocking reality that popular musicians' lifespans are up to 25 years shorter than the comparable US population. In the past six decades, homicide rates among musicians were found to be up to eight times greater than that of the US population. This comes as a stark reminder of the tragic and untimely deaths of artists such as John Lennon, Tupac Shakur, and Biggie Smalls. Death by Accidents and the Infamous Age of 27 The 1950s and 60s saw a spate of fatal accidents involving musicians, such as Buddy Holly, whose life was cut short in a plane crash. More recent times have seen the emergence of the so-called \\"27 Club,\\" a group of musicians who have all died at the age of 27, often under tragic circumstances. This includes legendary artists like Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, and Kurt Cobain. Gender Differences and the Role of Life Choices The research also revealed that female musicians, on average, tend to die in their early 60s rather than the average lifespan for their gender, which falls in the 80s. Meanwhile, male musicians were found to have a life expectancy in the late 50s, compared to the general male population who have an average lifespan of 75 years. Professor Kenny's work suggests one possible explanation for these shortened lifespans lies in the lack of boundaries, and the failure of the music scene to model and expect acceptable behavior from its stars. The pressures of fame, the access to drugs, and the influence of enablers could all play a role in this disturbing trend. Conclusion As the music industry continues to evolve in the face of globalization and technological advances, the findings of Professor Dianna Kenny's research serve as a sobering reminder that the lives of our celebrated musicians are not without their struggles and pitfalls. It is crucial that the industry takes these statistics as a wake-up call to provide better support and guidance to young and upcoming stars. This could be the difference between a long, successful career and a life tragically cut short."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

A detailed explanation for the answer: The given scenario mentions that the woman has a bandana tied around her eyes. This suggests that she is participating in an activity that requires her to be blindfolded. Among the four options provided, option II is the most suitable, as it involves the woman using a stick to swing at a pinata.  Pinatas are typically used during parties or celebrations, and swinging at them while blindfolded is a common custom. Participants take turns trying to hit the pinata while their eyes are covered, adding an element of suspense and excitement to the game. Option I may not be appropriate because it is unclear why the woman would need to be blindfolded while putting on a boot. Option III is not suitable as it doesn't explain why the woman needs to be blindfolded to dance with the children. In fact, being blindfolded might make it more difficult and dangerous for her to dance with them. Option IV might be interesting in a different context, but it does not provide a reason for both the woman and the man to be blindfolded, nor does it explain an activity that requires them to be so. Thus, the most logical answer considering the given context and the implications of the bandana tied around her eyes is option II, which indicates that the woman is using a stick to swing at a pinata."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Here is a news article: Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey showed no remorse over the alleged bad behavior of a former \\"hero\\" cop who is now being held on a 60 million dollar bail -- charged with sex assaults at gunpoint. (Published Monday, May 20, 2013)      Former Philadelphia police officer Richard DeCoatsworth, once honored by President Barack Obama for his heroism, remains in jail on 60 million bail for allegedly raping two women -- forcing one into prostitution.      Now, NBC10 has learned the City of Philadelphia is spending more than 1.5 million defending itself against DeCoatsworth's checkered past on the force.      Law enforcement sources say DeCoatsworth had nine citizen complaints against him over his nearly five year stint with the department. The complains, sources say, included allegations of assault, abuse and misconduct.      Issues with the 27-year-old began to arise in 2005 when he was in the Philadelphia Police Academy. DeCoatsworth allegedly injured a Girard Avenue business owner during a fight. However, he was allowed to remain a recruit despite the allegations.      Former Hero Officer Charged With Rape      A former Philadelphia Police Officer once hailed a hero is now in jail on 60 million bail after he allegedly raped two women at gunpoint. NBC10's Katy Zachry has the latest details. (Published Sunday, May 19, 2013)      In 2007 as a rookie officer, DeCoatsworth was severely injured after being shot in the face. After being shot, he managed to chase down the suspect for several blocks before collapsing. He called in enough information by radio that police were able to track down and arrest the suspect later the same day.      His actions earned him an invitation from Vice President Joe Biden to attend President Obama’s first congressional address at the U.S. Capital in February 2009. The officer sat in the gallery with First Lady Michelle Obama during the speech. He was also honored by his peers as a 2008 Top Cop.      Exclusive Beaten Man Flabbergasted by Police Arrest      Soon after, though, he was involved in two more dramatic incidents.      In April 2009, police say DeCoatsworth was jumped and attacked by a man when he tried to disperse a crowd at the Logan section of the city. During the struggle, sources say DeCoatsworth’s gun went off and hit the suspect who took off running. Another officer responding to the scene shot the suspect dead, according to sources.      Bail Set at 60M for Hero Officer Charged With Rape      Bail was set at 60 million Saturday for a former Philadelphia police officer Richard Decoatsworth who has been charged with raping two women at gunpoint. NBC10's Nefertiti Jaquez reports on the developing case. (Published Sunday, June 9, 2013)      In September 2009, DeCoatsworth and another officer stopped a man on a motorcycle in the Kensington section of the city. While they were questioning him, a second man allegedly jumped on the motorcycle and drove at the officers. Police say DeCoatsworth shot at the suspect, who sped off. The suspect was found later at the hospital where his mother had taken him to be treated for a shotgun wound.      During the incident, local witnesses claimed the two suspects did nothing wrong and that DeCoatsworth and the other officer acted recklessly -- shooting while children were nearby.      In November 2011, Internal Affairs investigated an alleged scuffle between DeCoatsworth and another officer, according to Philly.com.      DeCoatsworth retired from the police force on disability back in December 2011.      Hero Officer Charged With Raping Women      A former Philadelphia police officer once hailed as a hero and given a seat next to the first lady at a speech by President Obama has been arrested and charged with raping two women and other crimes. Former officer Richard DeCoatsworth was arrested and charged Saturday with rape, sexual assault, terroristic threats and related offenses. NBC10's Cydney Long reports. (Published Saturday, May 18, 2013)      In February of 2012, an arrest warrant was issued for DeCoatsworth after he allegedly threatened a woman in Port Richmond.      The most recent incident began two weeks ago after DeCoatsworth allegedly met a woman at a bar on North Front Street. Police say the former officer forced the woman into prostitution at a Days Inn hotel along Roosevelt Boulevard in the Lawncrest section of the city.      Then, between 2 a.m. Thursday and Friday evening, DeCoatsworth went to the woman’s home along North Howard Street in the Fishtown-Kensington area, according to a law enforcement source close to the investigation.      Once he arrived, DeCoatsworth allegedly forced that woman and a second woman, both in their 20s, to use drugs and perform oral sex on him at gunpoint. The alleged victims reported the assault Friday only after DeCoatsworth went home, according to police.      Hero Officer Arrested      A former Philadelphia Police Officer once hailed a hero was arrested on Saturday for allegedly holding two women captive. NBC10's Katy Zachry has the details. (Published Saturday, May 18, 2013)      Police raided DeCoatsworth’s house on the 2700 block of Salmon Street in the Port Richmond section of Philadelphia around 6:30 a.m. on Saturday.      He was arraigned and charged with rape, sexual assault, terroristic threats and other related offenses. Police also confiscated drugs and guns from the home, according to a source. No word yet on what kind of drugs were removed from the home.      Video Crossing Gate Hits School Bus as Train Approaches      According to court documents, bail was set at 25 million for each of the alleged victims. Another 10 million bail was set in a separate domestic violence case DeCoatsworth is now being charged with, according to investigators.      Police say he assaulted his live-in girlfriend on May 9. The 60 million bail is reportedly one of the highest set in Philadelphia history.      DeCoatsworth faces more than 32 crimes in all three cases. He is scheduled for another court appearance on June 17.      One of DeCoatsworth’s neighbors said she was relieved to hear about his arrest.      “I am scared to be saying this now but I hope he stays where he is at, he has been a thorn in the side of this neighborhood for so long,” said the woman who did not want to be identified.      Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter's Office says of the nine complaints lodged against DeCoatsworth -- one resulted in a lawsuit. The suit alleged DeCoatsworth used aggressive behavior while on the job.      The city settled that suit for 1.5 million. However, officials say Philadelphia has accrued other legal costs related to DeCoatsworth.      Last year, Philadelphia Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey told police he believed he failed DeCoatsworth by letting him go back to work with a stressful unit too soon after he was shot in the face.      \\"I think I screwed up on that,\\" Ramsey told the Daily News. \\"I think I should have given him more time. He didn't want more time but I should have done that.\\"      In light of his most recent arrest however, Ramsey had much harsher words for DeCoatsworth on Monday.      \\"He has to be held accountable,\\" Ramsey said. \\"Just like anybody else. There should be no special consideration given simply because he once served as a police officer.\\"      DeCoatsworth is being held on 60 million bail. A figure that is rarely seen in the U.S. criminal justice system.      Philadelphia District Attorney's Office spokeswoman Tasha Jamerson said prosecution did not request a high bail amount, rather that DeCoatsworth be held without bail.      “Being held without bail is the highest bail situation you could face as a defendant in Philadelphia,\\" Jamerson said, “At DeCoatsworth's arraignment on Saturday, we requested that he be held without bail, but the judge instead chose to impose bail at 60 million.”      Other high-profile cases, including federal trials held in Pennsylvania, have included large sums, but none are near what the 27-year-old is held on.      While many with similarly egregious crimes are held without bail, some are held on bonds that reach into the millions of dollars.      Christina Regusters, the 20-year old woman charged with abducting and raping a 5-year old girl in Cobbs Creek, is currently held on 4 million bond.      Ariel Castro, the Ohio man who is facing four counts of kidnapping and three counts of rape for holding three women captive in his home for a decade, is held on only 8 million.      While DeCoatsworth is listed as being represented by a public defender, family members are currently helping him acquire an attorney.

Richard DeCoatsworth in happier times, as he joined first lady Michelle Obama and Jill Biden at a presidential address in 2009. (Associated Press/File)      A retired Philadelphia police officer once hailed as a hero and invited by Michelle Obama in 2009 to sit next to her during the president's State of the Union address has been arrested and charged with raping and holding two women captive for two days. Richard DeCoatsworth, 27, was taken into custody early Saturday. When police arrived at his Port Richmond house on the 2700 block of Salmon Street, DeCoatsworth, who was armed, went to the basement to open a garage door and let out his pit bull, a law enforcement source said. The dog ran away after police fired two flash grenades. DeCoatsworth, discarding his gun, ran into the bedroom, where there was a loaded shotgun. Police subdued and arrested him without incident, the source said. DeCoatsworth had been under investigation by the Special Victims Unit after two women alleged that he forced them to use drugs and engage in sexual activity.      The women said they came into contact with DeCoatsworth about 2 a.m. Thursday at a party, said Officer Christine O'Brien, a police spokeswoman. They left the party with him, and the three went to another location.      Police did not identify the site of the party or say where the alleged crimes took place.      At the second site, DeCoatsworth took out a handgun and allegedly forced the two women \\"to engage in the use of narcotics and sexual acts,\\" O'Brien said.      The women reported the incident to police, and DeCoatsworth was charged with rape, sexual assault, terroristic threats, and related charges. His bail was set at 60 million.      The women told police DeCoatsworth had held them captive for two days, according to the law enforcement source.      It was a long fall from grace for the former officer, who in 2007 was lauded as a hero.      2009 tribute      As a 21-year-old rookie, DeCoatsworth took a shotgun blast to the face and, bleeding heavily and returning fire, pursued his attacker for several blocks before collapsing and radioing for help.      The gunman, Antonio Coulter, was caught and later pleaded guilty in the shooting. DeCoatsworth underwent extensive surgery and returned to duty in June 2008.      His heroism in that case led to an invitation to sit next to the first lady during the president's 2009 address.      DeCoatsworth then became involved in two controversial incidents in which he shot at suspects. In April 2009, he shot Anthony Temple when the man lunged for his gun, police said, and a backup officer then shot and killed Temple.      The following September, he wounded a man in a leg who allegedly ran at him on a motorcycle.      DeCoatsworth racked up a number of Internal Affairs complaints, and he retired in December 2011 at age 25. He left, a police spokesman said at the time, due to injuries from the 2007 shooting.      'Something like this'      Some in the Police Department had feared DeCoatsworth was badly troubled. One officer said DeCoatsworth's unpredictable behavior and temper had led some in the department to view him as a time bomb.      \\"I hate to say it, but I did see something like this coming,\\" the officer said Saturday.      Neighbors at a diner down the block from DeCoatsworth's home said he had been known to behave erratically. A woman who asked not to be named said she avoided the former officer after an incident in the fall in which his pit bull allegedly charged at her chihuahua.      \\"From the look in his eyes,\\" she said, \\"I was terrified.\\"      Shattered glass from DeCoatsworth's door spilled out over his front steps Saturday afternoon, and people inside refused to answer the door. When two people left the apartment, they declined to comment.      Contact Jonathan Lai      at 856-779-3220, jlai@phillynews.com, or follow on Twitter @elaijuh.

The First Crusade was proclaimed by Pope Urban II (pope 1088–99) at the Council of Clermont in 1095 in response to a request from the Byzantine Emperor Alexios I Komnenos (r. 1081–1118) for aid against further Muslim advances. Urban promised indulgence to anyone who took part. Tens of thousands of people from all levels of society mobilised across Europe and captured Jerusalem in 1099. One feature of the crusades was the pogroms against local Jews that often took place as the crusaders left their countries for the East. These were especially brutal during the First Crusade, when the Jewish communities in Cologne, Mainz, and Worms were destroyed, and other communities in cities between the rivers Seine and Rhine suffered destruction. Another outgrowth of the crusades was the foundation of a new type of monastic order, the military orders of the Templars and Hospitallers, which fused monastic life with military service.\\". Can you tell me what it is? Answer:","output":"After the First Crusade, which was proclaimed by Pope Urban II in 1095 and resulted in the capture of Jerusalem in 1099, several important events and developments took place. Firstly, there were pogroms against local Jewish communities as the crusaders left their countries for the East. The Jewish communities in Cologne, Mainz, and Worms were destroyed, and other communities in cities between the rivers Seine and Rhine suffered destruction as well. Another significant outcome of the First Crusade was the establishment of a new type of monastic order, the military orders of the Templars and Hospitallers. These orders combined monastic life with military service, representing a new fusion of religious and martial objectives. Despite the initial success of the First Crusade in capturing Jerusalem, it should be noted that this victory was followed by additional crusades over the next two centuries, as various Christian and Muslim powers struggled for control of the Holy Land and surrounding regions."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Before you begin the process of haltering your horse, you'll need to prepare the halter. If your horse is acting up, it can be hard to prepare the halter in the moment.  Unbuckle or unsnap the crown piece. This is the strap of the halter that goes behind the horse's ears. It should have a buckle or snap somewhere on it. Have your halter clipped to your lead line ahead of time. You want to be able to halter your horse and immediately lead him where he needs to go. You clip the lead line onto a ring at the bottom of the noseband. The noseband is the portion of a halter that slips around a horse's nose. Call your horse as you approach him. This helps alert your horse to your presence. This way, he's less likely to get spooked by your approach. Call out his name or call out something like, \\"I'm coming in!\\" to let him know you're entering his pasture or stall. Make sure you have your halter in your left hand as you approach. You will be haltering the horse from the left side. You want to make sure your horse knows what's happening. If you try to deceive the horse by hiding the halter, he'll learn to be distrustful of your intent. This can lead to a bad relationship between you and the horse. When haltering a horse, you should always approach from the left side. Halters are designed to be buckled on the left. You should approach your horse so you're standing near his head on the left side of his body. You do not want to put the halter on instantly. This can startle your horse. When you are a foot or so away from your horse's head, allow him to sniff your hand. This way, your horse will also familiarize himself with your scent. He'll be able to differentiate your smell from the smell of potential predators in other situations down the road. A nervous horse may benefit from having treats as a reward for staying calm.

Se completó en agosto de 1940, cuando entró en servicio en la armada alemana. Junto con su gemelo Tirpitz, fue el acorazado más grande jamás construido por Alemania y uno de los mayores botado por cualquier armada europea.[N 1]​ QUESTION: ¿Por qué se denominó Bismarck a este acorazado?","output":"En honor al canciller Otto von Bismarck, promotor de la unificación alemana en 1871."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Is \\"In 2009, Tucson ranked as the 32nd largest city and 52nd largest metropolitan area in the United States.\\" a good answer to the question \\"Where does Tuscon rank in terms of the largest city in the U.S. in 2009?\\"","output":"Yes, the statement \\"In 2009, Tucson ranked as the 32nd largest city and 52nd largest metropolitan area in the United States.\\" provides a sufficient answer to the question \\"Where does Tucson rank in terms of the largest city in the U.S. in 2009?\\". However, the answer can be expanded and contextualized to provide a more detailed and comprehensive response. Here is an elaborated answer: In 2009, Tucson, Arizona was ranked as the 32nd largest city by population in the United States. With a population of over 525,000 residents, Tucson was considered a significant urban center within the country. Located in the state of Arizona, Tucson is a thriving city in the Sonoran Desert, surrounded by beautiful mountain ranges. Established in 1775, Tucson has a rich history that predates its status as an American city and plays a major role in the state's development and identity. In addition to its ranking as the 32nd largest city, Tucson was also ranked as the 52nd largest metropolitan area within the United States in 2009. The Tucson metropolitan area, comprising Tucson as well as the surrounding towns and cities in Pima County, had an estimated population of just over 980,000 residents at that time. This designation highlights that Tucson is not only a significant city in its own right, but it is also an important part of a broader region that includes a large number of residents, businesses, and cultural institutions. Tucson's size and ranking in 2009 showcase its importance regionally and nationally, as well as its continued growth and development over the years. As part of the Sun Belt, a region in the United States characterized by its warm climate and rapid population growth since the 1960s, Tucson has been an appealing destination for people seeking new opportunities or looking to enjoy the city's unique desert landscape. Since that time, Tucson has continued to experience changes in its growth and ranking as other cities in the United States evolve and develop. It is important to note that these rankings are subject to change over time, and the latest available data should always be consulted for the most current rankings. However, the statement provided aptly answers the question of Tucson's ranking in 2009, while the expanded information offers a more comprehensive understanding of the city's historical context, regional significance, and potential for future growth."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer based on context: For the fourth time in as many trips to the western United States, the Jets lost to the woeful Seahawks in Mike Holmgren's final home game as  the team's head coach. The loss dropped the Jets to 9-6 and out of first place in the AFC East. Jay Feely put the Jets on the board with a field goal eight minutes into the game and the lead held for most of the remainder of the first half. Seattle scored with thirty one seconds remaining in the half on a Seneca Wallace touchdown pass. Olindo Mare kicked two field goals in the second half, including one with 1:47 remaining to clinch victory for Seattle. Brett Favre was held without a touchdown pass for the Jets and threw two interceptions, and Thomas Jones was held to 67 yards. For the Seahawks Maurice Morris rushed for 116 yards on 29 carries and Wallace finished with 175 yards passing and his second-quarter touchdown. How many more total rushing yards did Maurice Morris have compared to Thomas Jones?","output":"Maurice Morris rushed for 116 yards and Thomas Jones was held to 67 yards. To find the difference in total rushing yards between the two players, we can simply subtract Thomas Jones' yards from Maurice Morris' yards: 116 yards (Maurice Morris) - 67 yards (Thomas Jones) = 49 yards Maurice Morris had 49 more total rushing yards compared to Thomas Jones in that game."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Due to natural selection, organisms with traits that better enable them to adapt to their environment will tend to survive and reproduce in greater numbers. Natural selection causes beneficial heritable traits to become more common in a population and unfavorable heritable traits to become less common. For example, a giraffe’s neck is beneficial because it allows the giraffe to reach leaves high in trees. Natural selection caused this beneficial trait to become more common than short necks.  Mike lives in a cold mid-western city, where there is not much predator prey interaction. Mike noticed that in his city some squirrels have darker coat, while others have lighter coat.

Which coat would most likely become more common, darker or lighter? A:","output":"The darker coat would most likely become more common in Mike's city, as it is more suitable for the cold environment with less predator-prey interaction.

The corrected version is: \\"Notice again: 'To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in His throne' (Rev. 3:21).\\" The passage you have provided is taken from the Bible, specifically the Book of Revelation, which is the last book of the New Testament. It is written by the apostle John, who is the recipient of a series of visions and messages that foretell the end times and the second coming of Jesus Christ. In this passage, Jesus promises to those that remain steadfast in their faith and overcome the trials and tribulations they face, the reward of sitting with Him on the throne. This can be understood as a promise of eternal life, salvation, and co-reigning with Jesus in the Kingdom of God. The key themes of this verse are faithfulness, perseverance, and the ultimate reward for those who conquer the challenges that they encounter during their lifetime. This message of hope and reward serves as an inspiration for believers to persist in their faith despite the hardships they may face, as well as assurance that Jesus will be faithful to those who remain true to Him. The imagery of sitting on a throne with Jesus emphasizes the royal nature of the reward, which indicates that these individuals who overcome will share in the divine authority and governance in the new heaven and new earth as described in the Book of Revelation. The reference to Jesus overcoming and sitting down with the Father in His throne is a reminder of how Jesus overcame sin, death, and Satan through His death and resurrection, and also how He established the foundation for this eternal inheritance. In summary, Revelation 3:21 is a passage that offers hope, encouragement, and motivation for believers to face and prevail over any obstacles that come their way, knowing that the reward awaiting them is eternal salvation and the ultimate promise of sharing in the divine authority and glory with Jesus Christ Himself."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

I loved it, wore it for years, and haven't had another one since it stopped ticking a decade ago. Why? Because I don't need one. I have a mobile phone and I'm always near someone with an iPod or something like that. All these devices tell the time--which is why, if you look around, you'll see lots of empty wrists; sales of watches to young adults have been going down since 2007. But while the wise have realized that they don't need them, others--apparently including some distinguished men of our time--are spending total fortunes on them. Brands such as Rolex, Patek Philippe and Breitling command shocking prices, up to PS250.000 for a piece. This is ridiculous. Expensive cars go faster than cheap cars. Expensive clothes hang better than cheap clothes. But these days all watches tell the time as well as all other watches. Expensive watches come with extra functions--but who needs them? How often do you dive to 300 metres into the sea or need to find your direction in the area around the South Pole? So why pay that much of five years' school fees for watches that allow you to do these things? If justice were done, the Swiss watch industry should have closed down when the Japanese discovered how to make accurate watches for a five-pound note. Instead the Swiss reinvented the watch, with the aid of millions of pounds' worth of advertising, as a message about the man wearing it. Rolexes are for those who spend their weekends climbing icy mountains; a Patek Philippe is for one from a rich or noble family; a Breitling suggests you like to pilot planes across the world. Watches are now classified as\\"investments\\" . A 1994 Philippe recently sold for nearly PS350, 000, while the 1960s Rolexes have gone from PS15, 000 to PS30, 000 plus in a year.

Submission to RIM 2009 Translate to French","output":"Soumission au RIM 2009 Traduction en français: \\"Soumission au RIM 2009\\" se traduit simplement par \\"Soumission au RIM 2009\\" en français car RIM (Recherche et Innovation de Montréal) est un acronyme qui ne nécessite pas de traduction. Cependant, pour vous fournir une réponse détaillée et longue, je vais vous donner plus d'informations concernant la traduction de ce genre de phrases. Tout d'abord, il est important de noter que les acronymes n'ont généralement pas besoin d'être traduits, car ils constituent souvent des abréviations de noms propres ou d'organisations qui restent les mêmes dans toutes les langues. Par conséquent, \\"RIM\\" reste \\"RIM\\" en français. Cependant, il peut y avoir des cas où un acronyme a une signification différente dans une autre langue, ce qui pourrait alors nécessiter une traduction appropriée. Par exemple, si l'acronyme était \\"NASA\\" (National Aeronautics and Space Administration), alors il pourrait être traduit en français par \\"Agence spatiale américaine\\" même si son acronyme reste \\"NASA\\". Dans le contexte de cette phrase, \\"Submission\\" peut être traduit en \\"Soumission\\", qui souligne le fait que vous soumettez quelque chose (par exemple, un document, un projet ou une proposition) à l'organisation mentionnée. En ce qui concerne \\"to\\", il s'agit d'une préposition qui indique la direction ou le destinataire. En français, il peut être traduit par \\"à\\" ou \\"au\\" en fonction du genre et du nombre du nom qui suit. Dans ce cas, \\"au\\" est la traduction correcte puisque \\"RIM\\" est considéré comme un nom masculin singulier en français. Enfin, pour les années, la règle générale est de ne pas les traduire, car elles restent les mêmes dans toutes les langues. Ainsi, \\"2009\\" en anglais reste \\"2009\\" en français.

Movie Title: Disappointment Unleashed Step 1: Begin with an attention-grabbing introduction Justification: An interesting introduction will capture the reader's attention and encourage them to continue reading the review. Review: With a title that perfectly captures the essence of its content, Disappointment Unleashed swoops in like a tornado of bad decisions, destroying everything that made its promising premise so attractive. Step 2: Provide a brief summary of the plot Justification: Giving a brief summary will acquaint the reader with the film's storyline without revealing any spoilers. Review: The movie follows the lackluster journey of protagonist John Doe, a former secret agent, as he is coerced back into action to save the world from a generic megalomaniac villain bent on world domination. Step 3: Discuss the weaknesses in the plot and screenplay Justification: Pointing out the weaknesses in the plot and screenplay allows the reader to understand why the movie fails to deliver. Review: The plot is riddled with glaring clichés, inconsistencies, and illogical actions that completely tear apart any suspension of disbelief. The screenplay offers nothing new to the action genre, recycling tired one-liners and unimaginative set pieces, making the entire experience a true exercise in tolerance. Step 4: Comment on the performances of the actors Justification: Analyzing the performances can help the reader grasp how the actors contributed to the overall quality of the movie. Review: Despite a seasoned cast, the lackluster performances only further diminish the movie's already crumbling foundation. It seems as though the actors are all too aware of the weak material they are working with, resulting in disinterested and uninspired portrayals. Step 5: Evaluate the film's technical aspects Justification: Assessing the film's technical aspects gives a comprehensive review of every aspect of the movie production. Review: Adding insult to injury, Disappointment Unleashed also underwhelms in the technical department. From hastily edited action sequences to an underwhelming and forgettable score, it appears as though every creative choice made was another nail in the coffin for this deeply flawed film. Step 6: End with a concise conclusion Justification: Summing up the review with a clear evaluation will help the reader understand the overall quality of the movie. Review: Overall, Disappointment Unleashed lives up to its name and does little to redeem itself. With a weak plot, unimpressive performances, and forgettable technical aspects, it's best to leave this movie unwatched, unless you enjoy torturing yourself with cinematic failures.

Coopération internationale en matière fiscale Translate this to English?","output":"\\"International cooperation in fiscal matters\\" The phrase \\"Coopération internationale en matière fiscale\\" translates to \\"International cooperation in fiscal matters\\" in English.  This term typically refers to various activities and policies that countries establish and implement together to ensure efficiency, fairness, and transparency in fiscal matters. These activities may include organizing efforts to prevent illegal tax evasion across borders, establishing fair tax competition, ensuring effective information exchange regarding tax matters, and aligning global tax rules.  International cooperation in fiscal matters is a crucial topic in the global economy. The primary reason being that in this era of globalization and digital technology, companies and individuals can easily conduct activities and transactions across multiple countries. This then creates complexities in tax-related matters as different countries have diverse tax laws and regulations.  Therefore, multiple platforms have been established to enhance this area of cooperation. For example, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) often takes a lead, providing a forum for governments to work together to share experiences and seek solutions to common problems. It has been active in promoting international cooperation in tax matters, most notably through its Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) project, a comprehensive package of tax reforms aimed at ensuring multinational enterprises pay their fair share of taxes wherever they operate. Another example of an initiative that promotes international cooperation in fiscal matters is the Common Reporting Standard (CRS). Developed by the OECD and adopted by numerous countries, the CRS calls on jurisdictions to obtain information from their financial institutions and automatically exchange that information with other jurisdictions on an annual basis. This transparency allows for closer scrutiny of taxpayers’ accounts held overseas and is an effective measure against off-shore tax evasion. Moreover, it isn't just about combating tax evasion and avoidance. International cooperation in fiscal matters also looks at optimizing tax structures, harmonizing tax policies across countries to avoid double taxation, and supporting developing nations in building their tax capacities.  In conclusion, international cooperation in fiscal matters is a broad yet vital sector that plays a significant role in shaping up a just and stable global economy. It requires an ongoing commitment from all countries to work together to establish efficient, fair, and transparent tax systems globally."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this summary: – Despite some presidential Twitter drama, the House voted to extend the government's powers of warrantless surveillance another six years on Tuesday with a 256-164 vote, the Hill reports. Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act allows the NSA to collect from US companies texts and emails of foreign targets, even when those targets are communicating with Americans. The legislation was opposed by privacy advocates, and Republican Rep. Justin Amash introduced changes that would have forced authorities to get warrants before obtaining information on Americans caught in the surveillance, according to the Washington Post. Those changes were voted down 183-233. The Senate is expected to vote on and pass a Section 702 renewal before it expires Jan. 19. The vote wasn't without drama. President Trump sent House Republicans scrambling ahead of the vote when he tweeted that Section 702 \\"may have been used, with the help of the discredited and phony Dossier, to so badly surveil and abuse the Trump Campaign by the previous administration and others.\\" Trump's tweet came after the president watched a related segment on Fox News and despite the White House's official support for the legislation. About 90 minutes later he reversed course. \\"Today's vote is about foreign surveillance of foreign bad guys on foreign land,\\" Trump tweeted. \\"We need it! Get smart!\\" NPR takes a closer look at what Trump was talking about in his tweets, determining the president's \\"comments throw together a rat's nest of related, semi-related, and unrelated strands.\\"","output":"Title: House Votes to Extend Powers of Warrantless Surveillance Amid Presidential Drama  Despite some confusion and contention stirred by President Trump's tweets, the House of Representatives passed a vote, 256 to 164, to extend the government's authority for warrantless surveillance for another six years, according to a report from The Hill. This decision substantiates and prolongs Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), a policy that grants the National Security Agency (NSA) powers to gather texts and emails from foreign targets via US companies. This power extends even when these targets communicate with American citizens, which has raised serious concerns among privacy advocates.  Section 702 has long been a point of debate for privacy advocates, who argue that such warrantless surveillance stands in contrast to fundamental civil rights. The underlying opposition was further emphasized when Republican Representative Justin Amash attempted to introduce changes that would necessitate authorities to secure warrants before gaining access to any information about Americans ensnared in such surveillance. However, these proposed changes were voted down, 183 to 233, according to the Washington Post.  The surveillance power extension now sits before the Senate, which is projected to vote and pass the Section 702 renewal before it expires on January 19. The lead-up to the vote in the House was served with a side of drama when President Donald Trump, following a related segment on Fox News, tweeted contentious remarks about Section 702, suggesting its potential misuse during his campaign by the former administration. The tweet left many House Republicans in disarray, especially given the White House's official endorsement of the legislation. Around 90 minutes later, however, President Trump appeared to reverse his stance in another tweet emphasizing the importance of foreign surveillance. \\"Today's vote is about foreign surveillance of foreign bad guys on foreign land,\\" Trump wrote. \\"We need it! Get smart!\\" Nevertheless, the President's initial remarks raised numerous questions and speculations. NPR sought to unpack Trump's tweets and establish an understanding of their context, concluding that the president's \\"comments throw together a rat's nest of related, semi-related, and unrelated strands.\\" What remains clear is that the fate of Section 702, alongside the complex interplay of foreign surveillance, civil rights, and political statements, continues to remain a contentious and significant issue in contemporary American politics.  This case provides a clear illustration of how intricate and complex legislative processes can become when they intersect with advanced communication technologies, individual political agendas, and critical civil issues such as privacy rights. And, as the nation awaits the Senate's decision, we are reminded of how closely our civil liberties are linked to the judgments made within corridors of power."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize: Cleveland Police allegedly tried to monitor the activity of six people after a 2012 front-page story in the Northern Echo. This included reporters from the paper, a staff member and a solicitor, the Echo said. The force has not commented to the BBC. A complaint has been lodged by the Police Federation with the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC). The force allegedly used the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (RIPA) - which governs surveillance in relation to crime or concerns over public safety - to identify the whistle-blower. An application was made, the Echo said, after it published the story, which was based on an internal force report about institutionalised racism within the force. A Cleveland Police spokeswoman told the paper she could \\"neither confirm nor deny\\" whether a RIPA application had been made to monitor the phone activity of three of its journalists, a serving police officer, a solicitor and the then-chairman of Cleveland Police Federation. Northern Echo editor Peter Barron said: \\"These allegations are a matter of serious concern - that a police force should apparently go to these lengths to identify the source of a story which was clearly in the public interest. \\"This is surely not what the legislation was intended to do and the fact that Cleveland Police will neither confirm nor deny the allegations adds to our concerns.\\" The IPCC confirmed it had received the letter of complaint from the National Police Federation on behalf of the Cleveland Police Federation chair. Once registered, the complaint will be referred back to Cleveland Police to look at before the IPCC considers an independent investigation.

Which of the following solutions is better for the following goal: How to melt wax?","output":"To determine the best solution for melting wax, we need to consider multiple factors such as safety, efficiency, and convenience. Here, I will outline two common methods for melting wax and provide a comparative analysis to decide which one is better. 1. Double Boiler Method: A double boiler is a traditional stove-top method that involves placing a heat-safe bowl or container containing wax over a pot of simmering water. The steam from the water indirectly heats the container, thus melting the wax gently and evenly. Advantages: - It is a safer method, as the risk of overheating or burning the wax is considerably low. - The wax temperature can be maintained easily and consistently by controlling the water's temperature. - Suitable for melting various types of wax, including candle wax, paraffin wax, and beeswax. Disadvantages: - Takes longer to melt wax as the heat is indirect. - Requires constant supervision to ensure the water does not boil away. 2. Microwave Method: This method involves placing wax in a microwave-safe container and heating it in a microwave at short intervals. The wax is stirred between each interval to promote even melting. Advantages: - It is a faster method, typically taking only a few minutes to melt wax. - Easy and convenient as most households have access to a microwave. - Uses less energy compared to the double boiler method. Disadvantages: - Uneven heating can cause temperature spikes and result in overheated wax, releasing toxic fumes. - Monitoring the melting wax can be challenging due to microwaving at short intervals. - Not suitable for all types of wax, as some waxes need consistent, gentle heat to avoid damaging their properties. Comparative Analysis: The double boiler method is a safer option, offering more precise control of temperature and reduces the chance of overheating the wax. While it may take longer to melt the wax, it's ideal for all types of wax, ensuring quality and consistency. This method is essential in crafting high-quality candles, cosmetics, or other products that require greater control over wax properties. On the other hand, the microwave method is a quicker solution that's more energy-efficient. However, it lacks the level of temperature control offered by the double boiler method. It can result in uneven heating and limit its applicability to specific types of wax. Conclusion: Considering safety, efficiency, and convenience, the double boiler method is the better solution for melting wax. It provides better temperature control, consistency, and accommodates various types of wax, ultimately resulting in better outcomes for your projects. While the microwave method may be faster, the risks and limitations outweigh the benefits and make it less suitable for most wax melting purposes."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

What kind of thing would answer this question?","output":"To tie-dye clothes, you will need a few materials and follow some simple steps. Tie-dying is a fun and creative way to add color and design to clothing. The process involves using colored dyes and different tying techniques to create unique patterns on fabric. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to tie-dye clothes: Materials: 1. White or light-colored clothing (cotton works best) 2. Fabric dye (you can use multiple colors for more vibrant results) 3. Rubber bands or string 4. Gloves (to avoid staining your hands with the dye) 5. Plastic wrap or large plastic bags 6. Buckets or containers for dye baths 7. Water 8. Mixing sticks or spoons 9. White vinegar or soda ash (to help the dye set) 10. Access to water for rinsing (sink, hose, or washing machine) Here's a detailed process to tie-dye your clothes: Step 1: Prewash your fabric Before you begin tie-dying, make sure to prewash your fabric. This removes any dirt, grease, or sizing from the fabric and ensures that the dye will bond better. Keep your fabric damp after washing, as it's easier to apply the dye to wet fabric. Step 2: Choose your dyeing technique There are several tying techniques that create different patterns on your fabric. Some popular patterns are the classic spiral, bullseye, sunburst, and accordion folds. Choose the technique you'd like to create on your clothing, and follow the corresponding folding and tying method. Step 3: Tie your fabric Using your chosen technique, fold and tie the fabric with rubber bands or string. Ensure the ties are secure, as they will create the pattern by resisting the dye. Step 4: Prepare your dye Following the instructions on your fabric dye, mix the dye with water in your buckets or containers. If your dye requires a fixative to help it set, mix either white vinegar or soda ash into the dye bath. Step 5: Apply the dye to your fabric Put on your gloves and begin applying dye to your tied fabric. You can either submerge your fabric in the dye bath or use squeeze bottles to apply the dye directly to specific areas. Make sure you saturate the fabric well with the dye to achieve a vibrant result. Step 6: Wrap the dyed fabric Once you've applied the dye, wrap your fabric in plastic wrap or place it in a large plastic bag. This helps to keep the dye moist, allowing it to set more effectively. Let the fabric sit for at least 6-8 hours, or for the time specified by your dye manufacturer. Some people let their fabric sit for up to 24 hours for more vibrant colors. Step 7: Rinse and wash your fabric After the dye has set, remove your fabric from the plastic wrap and carefully remove the rubber bands or string. Rinse the fabric with cold water until the water runs clear. Then, wash your tie-dyed clothing separately using mild detergent and warm water. This removes any excess dye and helps to prevent color bleeding. After washing, dry your fabric according to its care instructions. Step 8: Enjoy your tie-dyed clothing Now you have a uniquely designed piece of tie-dyed clothing. Show off your creation and enjoy the vibrant colors and patterns. Remember that experimentation and practice are key to perfecting your tie-dye technique. Try different folding and tying methods, as well as different dye combinations to find your favorite styles and designs."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Write an article based on these highlights.","output":"Title: Controversial Rally Set to Take Place at Gettysburg National Military Park on October 5 Subtitle: Park Officials Defend the Group's Right to Hold Event Under the First Amendment Date: September 30 Gettysburg National Military Park in Pennsylvania is set to host a rally on October 5 despite concerns raised by some surrounding its controversial nature. Park officials have stated that the group organizing the event has the right to hold the rally, as guaranteed by the First Amendment of the United States Constitution, which protects freedom of speech, assembly, and the right to petition the government for redress of grievances. The group in question, which has chosen to remain anonymous, has faced widespread criticism for its views and messages conveyed during previous demonstrations, prompting public backlash and debates over the appropriateness of rallying at such a historic and symbolically significant site. Gettysburg National Military Park, established in 1895, commemorates and preserves the site of the Battle of Gettysburg, a turning point in the American Civil War that effectively ended Confederate General Robert E. Lee's second and arguably his most ambitious invasion of the North. The decision to allow the event to proceed appears to be an effort to balance the protection of First Amendment rights and respect for the historical significance of the park, which continues to draw intense public interest and discussion. As one of the most visited national military parks in the country, Gettysburg remains a symbolic site representing the struggle for unity and civil liberties in the United States. Park officials have defended their position by emphasizing the importance of upholding the fundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution, even in the face of potentially provocative and contentious topics. They cited the First Amendment not only as protection for the organizers' right to assemble and express their views but also as a bulwark that ensures the preservation of historical sites like Gettysburg, where the lessons of the past can be confronted and discussed openly. The upcoming rally on October 5 is not the first event of its kind held at the park; the group organized a similar demonstration in early September, which also sparked controversy and debates over free speech and historical preservation. Critics of the rallies argue that allowing these potentially divisive events at such hallowed ground might detract from Gettysburg's primary purpose: to provide a space where visitors can reflect on the gravity of the Civil War and its impact on American history. On the other hand, proponents of the group's right to hold the event state that allowing them to rally at Gettysburg might serve as a timely reminder of the very liberties and principles that the site represents. As the park itself bears witness to a nation divided, it is crucial to uphold the constitutional rights that ultimately define the freedoms and values the United States was built upon. As the October 5 rally approaches, park officials, participants, and the public alike will be forced to grapple with the delicate balance between the exercise of First Amendment rights and the respectful preservation of the nation's historical landmarks. Gettysburg National Military Park will undoubtedly remain a site of reflection for the ongoing triumphs and challenges faced by the United States as a nation committed to upholding the ideals of civil liberties and unity."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Victoria lacked a great deal of patience. So while Emily continued to develop her sewing skills, Victoria decided to try something else that might suit her temperament better. She thought about what kind of hobbies she could dedicate her time to, ones that would bring her more immediate satisfaction. After some research, she stumbled upon painting. Intrigued, Victoria bought some basic supplies and set up her first canvas. Emily, on the other hand, was finding a lot of joy in sewing. She took her time to learn various stitches, patterns, and techniques, eagerly following tutorials to create intricate designs. She found the process to be soothing and rewarding, as her patience allowed her to produce beautiful, detailed work. Eventually, she started working on more elaborate projects, such as quilting and creating custom clothing. Victoria dove headfirst into the world of painting, quickly discovering that she enjoyed the spontaneity and creative freedom it provided. Unlike sewing, which required her to follow specific patterns and be meticulous, painting allowed her to quickly capture her emotions and ideas on the canvas. Without the need for extensive planning or preparation, Victoria felt more in control and excited to see immediate results. One day, Emily and Victoria decided to combine their newfound skills and collaborate on a project. They brainstormed ideas and settled on creating a unique piece of artwork together. Emily sewed a beautiful tapestry, featuring intricate patterns and designs. Victoria, feeling inspired, added vibrant colors and bold strokes of paint to the tapestry, enhancing the visual impact of the piece. The finished tapestry was a stunning combination of both their skills, showcasing the harmonious blend of sewing and painting. Emily's patience and dedication to detail in the sewing perfectly complemented Victoria's spontaneous and expressive painting style. Their friends and family were amazed by the incredible piece of art they had created together. Through this experience, Emily and Victoria learned that, despite their contrasting personalities and individual interests, they could still find a way to collaborate and create something beautiful. They continued to explore their respective passions while also encouraging and supporting each other's creative journey.

First, they had to pay a 10 cover charge, which might have led them to expect certain quality facilities and entertainment.

Given those answer options, answer the question: U.S. President Donald Trump says he may veto a 1.3 trillion spending bill because it does not offer protections for young undocumented immigrants who arrived as children and does not fully fund the border wall. In a Twitter post Friday morning, Trump said he is considering a veto of the omnibus spending bill based on \\"the fact that the 800,000 plus DACA recipients have been totally abandoned by the Democrats (not even mentioned in Bill) and the BORDER WALL, which is desperately needed for our National Defense, is not fully funded.\\" Previously, White House officials said Trump would sign the spending package, a move that would head off a potential government shutdown due to a lack of funding. The measure funds the federal government through September 30. If Trump does not sign the legislation into law, the federal government will shut down at 12:01 a.m. Saturday. The Senate passed the bill by a 65-32 vote early Friday morning after the House of Representatives approved the measure Thursday. Lawmakers had just hours to read the nearly 2,200-page bill released Wednesday night.  With midterm elections looming in November, the bill likely marks the final time Capitol Hill considers major legislation this year. The measure fulfills Trump’s vow to boost military funding but provides funding for limited parts of his immigration agenda. The bill includes a 2.4 percent pay raise for military personnel. After extensive negotiations between Republicans and Democrats, the bill also provides 1.6 billion for physical barriers and 150 kilometers of a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border, short of the 25 billion Trump requested for the project he repeatedly touted on the campaign trail while pledging Mexico would pick up the cost.

Just because he might not have shown interest in the past doesn't mean he can't grow to like you in the future.\\" Evalle nodded half-heartedly, trying her best to believe in Lanna's words. She couldn't shake the nagging feeling that she had messed up, that she had pushed him away by revealing her emotions too soon. Their friendship had always been the perfect blend of laughter, understanding, and support – perhaps adding romantic feelings into the mix had ruined everything. The thought was unbearable. \\"Why don't you try talking to him?\\" Lanna suggested, leaning toward Evalle as she placed a comforting hand on her arm. \\"Get his perspective on things.

Yet, the thought of rejection loomed over her like a dark cloud, threatening to send her spiraling into a pit of loneliness and despair. Unable to decide on her course of action, Evalle found herself turning her gaze to Lanna, seeking reassurance and guidance.

It is held on the last Wednesday of August.?","output":"The festival you are referring to is called \\"La Tomatina.\\" La Tomatina is a unique and world-famous event held annually in the Valencian town of Buñol, Spain, on the last Wednesday of August. The festival is centered around a massive tomato fight, where participants engage in throwing tomatoes at each other for fun and amusement.  La Tomatina's origin dates back to 1945, when a group of young people were participating in a parade with musicians, giants, and big-heads figures in Buñol's town square. A participant accidentally fell off one of the big-heads, causing a fight to ensue in which someone grabbed tomatoes from a nearby vegetable stall and started throwing them as a form of retaliation. The following year, people brought tomatoes from their homes to engage in a tomato fight without any official permission. Eventually, after several years of being banned and embraced, La Tomatina festival became part of Buñol's official annual festivities in 1975. The event now attracts thousands of participants from all over the world, who gather in Buñol to be part of this exciting and fun-filled spectacle. The festival begins early in the morning when trucks carrying loads of ripe tomatoes make their way through the town square. Once the event starts, people throw tomatoes at each other for approximately one hour, resulting in the streets and participants being covered in a sea of red tomato pulp.  To ensure safety and order, certain rules are put in place during La Tomatina. Participants are required to crush the tomatoes before throwing them to avoid injuring anyone. It is prohibited to bring any hard objects, wear flip-flops, or throw anything other than tomatoes during the event. The tomato fight ends with the firing of a second shot, signaling participants to stop throwing tomatoes. Once La Tomatina's tomato fight is over, the town's streets and participants are hosed down, leaving Buñol clean and spotless. Participants can also make use of public showers or take a dip in the local river to wash off the tomato residue. Following the cleaning, the remaining festival activities commence, including music, dancing, and food events, as people celebrate the unique tradition and joy of La Tomatina."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Read this article and answer this question Somers and his company remained in Bermuda for 10 months, living on food they could gather on the island and fish from the sea. Some commentators believe that this incident inspired William Shakespeare's play The Tempest. During their time on the islands, the crew and passengers built a church and houses, the start of the Bermuda colony. Somers and Sir Thomas Gates oversaw the construction of two small ships, the Deliverance and the Patience. They were built from local timber  and the salvaged spars and rigging of the wrecked Sea Venture. In May 1610 the ships set sail for Jamestown, with the surviving 142 castaways on board taking food from the island. When they reached the settlement, they found it nearly destroyed by the famine and disease of what has been called the \\"Starving Time\\". Few of the supplies from the Supply Relief Fleet had arrived , and only 60 settlers survived. Only the food and help offered by those on the two small ships from Bermuda, followed by a relief fleet in July 1610 commanded by Lord Delaware, enabled the colony to survive and avoided the abandonment of Jamestown. Somers returned to Bermuda in the Patience to collect more food, but he became ill on the journey. He died in Bermuda on 9 November 1610 at age 56.

Federal prosecutors involved in escapee’s case get protection BY FRANK MAIN AND FRAN SPIELMAN Staff Reporters      Joseph \\"Jose\\" Banks escaped from the Metropolitan Correctional Center at 71 W. Van Buren St. Last week, Banks told U.S. District Judge Rebecca Pallmeyer, “You’ll hear from me!” after he was found guilty of bank robbery. | FBI photo      storyidforme: 41897451      tmspicid: 15470045      fileheaderid: 7004157      Updated:      Even though he made an apparent threat to a judge last week, Joseph “Jose” Banks wasn’t under extra security in the federal jail in downtown Chicago.      The convicted bank robber escaped from the Metropolitan Correctional Center early Tuesday with fellow bank robber Kenneth Conley. They apparently crawled through a hole bashed in their 17th-floor cell and slid down a rope fashioned from sheets.      Last week, Banks told U.S. District Judge Rebecca Pallmeyer, “You’ll hear from me!” after he was found guilty of bank robbery. An apparent threat like that would typically land a prisoner in a special housing unit where he would be allowed out just one hour a day until authorities checked it out, said a source familiar with the jail’s procedures.      The decision to house Banks in the general jail population raises questions about the security there, the source said. Indeed, Pallmeyer and the federal prosecutors in Banks’ case are now being given special protection because of the apparent threat.      On Wednesday, authorities said a videotape from a private surveillance camera showed the robbers fleeing in a cab on Congress Parkway around 2:40 a.m. Tuesday.      Officials continued the manhunt Wednesday and the FBI offered a 50,000 reward for information leading to the escapees’ capture.      On Wednesday, the head of the national jail guards union and Chicago Police Supt. Garry McCarthy raised questions about the escape, but federal prison officials didn’t have many answers.      Dale Deshotel, president of the Council of Prison Locals 33, said the escape raises key concerns about whether there was enough staffing at the jail and whether it was an “inside job” that involved a bribed jail employee. He also wondered whether jail officials assigned anyone to conduct regular patrols outside the facility to look for signs of an escape.      McCarthy said the daring breakout will almost certainly result in disciplinary action — and it should.      “There’s probably some sort of a systematic problem, and I’m sure that they will address it,” he said.      Banks and Conley were accounted for at a 10 p.m. Monday head count. Jail employees discovered the escape at 7 a.m. Tuesday. It’s unclear what happened during the usual head counts at midnight, 3 a.m. and 5 a.m.      Ed Ross, spokesman for the U.S. Bureau of Prisons, said escapes from “secured facilities” like the MCC are rare.      “From time to time, we have inmates who walk away from camps, but those are not considered secured facilities, and they don’t have fences and perimeter patrols,” he said.      Ross said the last escape from a secured federal facility was in 2006, when convicted murderer Richard McNair busted out of the U.S. penitentiary in Pollock, La.      Ross said he couldn’t provide details of the circumstances surrounding Tuesday’s escape.      In 1985, two inmates engineered a similar breakout from the MCC. They smuggled a barbell from a workout area into their sixth-floor cell and punched a hole in the cinder-block wall. They used a cord connected to a floor buffer to rappel down the wall to the plaza below.      Last year, a Chicago narcotics kingpin testified about several glaring security breaches at the MCC. Saul Rodriguez told a jury he recruited his wife and an inmate to smuggle a cellphone into the jail. He also said he used his job as a jail orderly to get close to a Mexican drug cartel leader who wanted government witnesses killed. ||||| Two convicted bank robbers who pulled off a daring overnight escape from a high-rise Chicago jail had changed from their prison garb by the time they hopped into a cab near the lock-up, investigators said Wednesday as they expanded their manhunt for the men.

Chicago Police Sgt. Michael... (Associated Press)      Authorities were raiding houses and combing through records looking for anybody with ties to the inmates who climbed out a jail window and descended 20 stories using a makeshift rope.      The FBI said surveillance footage from a camera near the Metropolitan Correctional Center shows Kenneth Conley and Joseph Banks getting into a cab at about 2:45 a.m. Tuesday _ about two hours before guards were supposed to do a bed check and four hours before workers spotted the rope dangling from the federal jail. The pair had changed from their orange jail-issued jumpsuits into light-colored pants and shirts, the FBI said.      \\"We don't know if they fashioned their own clothes, or what,\\" said Special Agent Frank Bochte.      The FBI was offering a 50,000 reward for information leading to the apprehension of Conley and Banks, with the manhunt focused mainly on Chicago and its suburbs.      Law enforcement officials said at least three homes in the suburbs south of Chicago where one of the inmates once lived were searched Tuesday, and a suburban strip club where Conley once worked confirmed that investigators had visited.      Investigators believe the men had been at a home in Tinley Park, 25 miles southwest of Chicago, just hours before police SWAT teams stormed it. A law enforcement official said the home was that of Conley's mother and that after the woman refused to let the escapees in, the men used a rock to break a window.      The person, who was not authorized to discuss the investigation so would speak only on condition of anonymity, said authorities also searched the home of a former girlfriend of Conley in nearby New Lenox, where the escapees had eaten breakfast.      In Orland Park, which borders Tinley Park, police Chief Timothy McCarthy said records revealed Conley had been arrested several years ago on a robbery charge.      \\"We looked at our own files and came up with a former colleague, a past associate,\\" he said.      Orland Park officers helped search a house where the associate lives or once lived, he said, but there was no evidence the escaped inmates had been there.      But the chain of events illustrates just the kind of thing investigators are doing: looking through records, arrest reports and even traffic tickets in the hopes of finding where the men went.      Authorities have not said exactly how many people are involved with the search. But the entire 35-member staff of the U.S. Marshals Service's Chicago office was involved, a show of force that spokeswoman Belkis Cantor said \\"was rare.\\"      Many questions remained about how the two managed to pull off such an escape from the federal prison in the heart of downtown Chicago. At the top of the list is how they could have smashed a gaping hole into the wall at the bottom of a 6-inch wide window being heard or seen by correctional officers.      Another question is why, in the federal facility that houses some 700 inmates, the correctional officers didn't notice the men were missing between a 10 p.m. headcount and one at 5 a.m.      A guidebook for jail inmates indicates there would have been headcounts at midnight and 3 a.m. But inmates aren't required to stand for those headcounts, only for ones at 4 p.m. and 10 p.m. It's unclear if guards may have been fooled by items the FBI said the men stuffed under their beds to make it appear they were there.      It's also unclear what happened between when authorities have said guards first realized the men were missing and when the rope was spotted at 7 a.m.      Authorities also have not said how the two men managed to collect 200 feet of bed sheet or how the broke through the wall.      The escape bore a striking resemblance to one at the same jail in 1985. In that case, convicted murderer Bernard Welch and an accomplice, Hugh Colomb, smashed through a window with a bar from a weight set and used bed sheets and an electrical cord attached to a floor buffer to descend six stories to the ground.      William Rollins, a Washington, D.C., police detective at the time who was brought in by the U.S. Marshals Service to investigate, said the noise of breaking the wall would have been deafening. But he thinks other inmates would have gladly made a lot of noise to drown out the sound.      \\"They will lure a guard into the laundry room and have all the dryers going,\\" said Rollins, now retired, whose investigation is included in a book about Welch by Jack Burch and James B. King called \\"Ghost Burglar.\\"      Not only that, but he said his investigation revealed that inmates had hidden hacksaw blades in ceiling tiles and drill bits in bed frames.      \\"And they used a vacuum cleaner motor to power the drill bit,\\" he said. \\"These guys are really creative.\\"      Rollins said it's likely Conley and Banks are still in the area. The vast majority of escapees don't stray too far, he said.      \\"They stay where they feel comfortable in that environment,\\" he said. ||||| The mother of one of the two bank robbers who daringly escaped from a Chicago jail cell by breaking through the window and scurrying down the building, notified the police of their visit to her Tinley Park suburban home.      Joseph \\"Jose\\" Banks and Kenneth Conley turned up at the home of Sandy Conley after they scaled the wall of the jail using a rope fashioned from bed sheets and blankets. Once they arrived at the home where Conley's mother lived with her other children on Tuesday morning, they were quickly turned away, her landlord said.      \\"He came into the house and he was with the other guy, and they came up and she said, 'I can't help you.' Then she called the police,\\" Ron Bailey, Sandy Conley's landlord, told ABCNews.com. \\"I don't know if I'd have been able to do that to my own kid.\\"      As a massive manhunt for the two bank robbers, who police said should be considered \\"armed and dangerous,\\" entered its second day, the FBI announced it would offer a 50,000 reward for information leading to their apprehension, ABC-owned Chicago station WLS reported.      An upstairs neighbor told landlord Ron Bailey that Banks and Conley showed up at the home and Conley's mother took a gun away from him before they left, WLS reported.      The FBI stormed the house but believe they missed the escapees by a few hours. Banks, 37, and Conley, 38, were being held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center, a federal jail in Chicago's Loop District. Police said the two men, who were cell mates, were last seen in the jail Monday at 10 p.m. during a head count.      Bailey said that he was sitting at the bar he owns in Tinley Park watching the television when he saw news footage of his property being swarmed by police.      \\"I just saw the SWAT team and the feds coming at the house,\\" he said. \\"I jumped in my car and got over there, but they wouldn't let me near the place. I waited half an hour, and then left.\\"      Bailey said that he had spoken to Sandy Conley, who works as a home nurse, several times since her encounter with her son and Banks.      \\"She's upset, she's crying,\\" he said. \\"She's a good woman.\\"      In an FBI affidavit filed Tuesday night, authorities said sometime after the head count the two men stuffed their beds with clothes in the shape of bodies and broke the window inside their cell. They squeezed through the 5-inch window and scaled down more than 20 stories using a rope made of bed sheets, towels and blankets.      To cover up their escape, Banks and Conley made fake bars to put over the window and placed the actual metal bars inside a mattress, according to the affidavit.      Police did not realize the men had escaped until approximately 7 a.m. Tuesday when arriving employees noticed the rope that led the men to freedom still dangling from the building.      Four elementary schools and a middle school were put on a soft lockdown, and all after school activities were canceled after police got word the escapees had been spotted in Tinley Park, WLS reported.      FBI spokeswoman Joan Hyde said the trail had since gone cold, and that no one should take matters into their own hands if Banks and Conley were spotted.      Banks, known as the Second-Hand Bandit because he wore used clothes during his heists, was convicted last week of robbing two banks and attempting to rob two others. Court records show that he stole less than 600,000, but more than 500,000 of it is still missing, and he could have access to it, WLS reported.      Banks, who represented himself at trial, had to be restrained at one point and vowed he would seek retribution, telling the judge, \\"You'll hear from me,\\" WLS reported.      Conley was scheduled to be sentenced on Jan. 10 after he pleaded guilty to robbing 4,000 from a bank, according to WLS. ||||| Write a summary.","output":"Two convicted bank robbers, Joseph \\"Jose\\" Banks and Kenneth Conley, escaped from the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Chicago by scaling down the 17th-floor building using a rope made from bed sheets.

Murders are as high as ever in jolly old England and the police are carrying assault weapons and pistols now because of the high instances of violence.. The US has far less violent crime per capita then they do but they are supposed to be a model for our future?? US street gangs are the big problem and Obama is ignoring that his people are the problem.. Take away American citizen's guns and arm Jihadists and revolutionaries of the world along with passing thousands of weapons to Mexican drug cartels, Obama's great plan?? US High in Gun Ownership, Low in Murder Rate Several reports on gun ownership around the world clearly refute the assertion that the abundance of guns in the United States leads to a high rate of firearm homicides. Americans are the biggest gun owners by far, with an estimated 270 million civilian firearms, in addition to those used by law enforcement and the military. That’s according to the Small Arms Survey of 178 nations conducted by the Switzerland-based Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies. In sheer numbers of civilian firearms, the No. 2 nation, surprisingly, is India with 46 million, followed by China (40 million), Germany (25 million), Pakistan (18 million), and Mexico (15 million). The United States also leads in gun ownership rate, with about 88 firearms per 100 people, according to the most recent Small Arms Survey compiled in 2007. That is far ahead of No. 2 Yemen, which has 55 firearms per 100 people. Switzerland is third with 46 per 100 people, followed by Finland (45), Serbia (38), Cyprus (36), Saudi Arabia (35), and Iraq (34). But when it comes to the firearm homicide rate, the United States doesn’t even make the top 25. According to figures collected by the United Nations’ Office on Drugs and Crime through its annual crime survey, 9,146 Americans were victims of a firearm homicide in the most recent year. That translates to a rate of 2.97 firearm homicides per 100,000 population, only the 27th highest rate in the world. The highest rate by far can be found in Honduras, 68 homicides per 100,000, followed by El Salvador (40), Jamaica (39), Venezuela (38.9), Guatemala (34), and Colombia (27). For America’s neighbors, the rate in Mexico is 9.9 per 100,000, and in Canada, 0.5 per 100,000. It is interesting to note that not only does the United States have a relatively low homicide rate compared to its gun ownership rate, but Switzerland, which ranks third in the civilian gun ownership rate, has only the 46th highest homicide rate, and Finland, with the fourth highest ownership rate, is 63rd on the list. “The most obnoxious liberal talking points on guns involve the idea that guns, in and of themselves, cause gun violence,” writes CNS News commentator Stephen Gutowski. “In other words, more guns must mean more gun violence.” But in light of the ownership and homicide figures, he observes: “More guns do not, in fact, mean more gun violence. Guns can be, and commonly are, used in a responsible manner, especially here in the United States.” Write a title for it.","output":"\\"US Leads in Gun Ownership but Not in Firearm Homicide Rates: Debunking the Gun Violence Myth\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: I can use this background: In the U.S., the majority of electricity is produced by burning coal or other fossil fuels. This causes air pollution, acid rain, and global warming. Fossil fuels are also limited and may eventually run out. Like fossil fuels, radioactive elements are limited. In fact, they are relatively rare, so they could run out sooner rather than later. On the other hand, nuclear fission does not release air pollution or cause the other environmental problems associated with burning fossil fuels. This is the major advantage of using nuclear fission as a source of energy.  Now, I have a new situation: Jennifer is currently looking for a new city to move to since she is looking to change her life and just do something different. Jennifer is a strong environmentalist and doesn't want to move to a city that contributes a lot to climate change since she feels it's every person's duty to take care of the Earth. She looks online and finds out about two cities in Minnesota that are several hundred miles apart. Jamestown has a very famous water park and uses coal to generate the city's electricity. Dapperton, the other city she is considering, has a neat hobby shop that Jennifer likes and the city uses nuclear power for its electricity needs.  Answer this question please: Will Dapperton have a higher or lower chance of acid rain than Jamestown? The answer is:","output":"Dapperton will have a lower chance of acid rain than Jamestown. Step 1: Identify the sources of electricity generation for both cities - Jamestown uses coal - Dapperton uses nuclear power Step 2: Understand the environmental impact of the different sources of electricity generation - Coal burning produces air pollution, acid rain, and contributes to global warming - Nuclear fission does not release air pollution or cause other environmental problems associated with burning fossil fuels Step 3: Compare the cities based on their electricity generation methods - Since coal burning contributes to acid rain, and Jamestown uses coal for electricity generation, Jamestown will have a higher chance of acid rain - Dapperton, on the other hand, uses nuclear power, which does not cause acid rain Conclusion: Dapperton, which uses nuclear power for its electricity needs, will have a lower chance of acid rain than Jamestown, which relies on coal for electricity generation."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Read this: By 1937, Japan controlled Manchuria and was ready to move deeper into China. The Marco Polo Bridge Incident on 7 July 1937 provoked full-scale war between China and Japan. The Nationalist and Communist Chinese suspended their civil war to form a nominal alliance against Japan, and the Soviet Union quickly lent support by providing large amount of materiel to Chinese troops. In August 1937, Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek deployed his best army to fight about 300,000 Japanese troops in Shanghai, but, after three months of fighting, Shanghai fell. The Japanese continued to push the Chinese forces back, capturing the capital Nanking in December 1937 and committed which was known as Nanking Massacre. In March 1938, Nationalist forces won their first victory at Taierzhuang. but then the city of Xuzhou was taken by Japanese in May. In June 1938, Japan deployed about 350,000 troops to invade Wuhan and captured it in October. The Japanese achieved major military victories, but world opinion—in particular in the United States—condemned Japan, especially after the Panay Incident.

Please answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: Where were sixty thousand more were sold in 2005?, using the article: The mountainous terrain and geographic features of El Hatillo have made it difficult to extend the Caracas Metro to southeast Caracas, so the main transportation methods in the municipality are private vehicles and road public transportation. An extension of the Metro – Line 5 – has been proposed, but construction has not been initiated as of 2007; phase 2 of Line 4 is still under construction. Urban planning in the municipality has been unorganised; news archives show that at least since 1998, neighbors have been complaining about the dense traffic caused by new residential and commercial construction, yet new or enhanced alternative roads to resolve the traffic problems have not been completed. A south beltway suggested 25 years ago has not been constructed due to its high cost.  However, as of January 2006, a new route that will connect La Lagunita with Macaracuay – a neighborhood in northeast Caracas – is under construction and is planned to be completed in 2010; according to Mayor Catalán, 23% of El Hatillo's inhabitants will eventually use this transit way. Its cost was estimated in early 2006 as US19,572,000.Local solutions – such as the proposed Metro extension line and the road connecting La Lagunita and Macaracuay – may improve the traffic congestion around El Hatillo, but the traffic issue affects all of Caracas. It is estimated that one million vehicles transit Caracas daily, causing a collapse of the transportation network.  Automobiles travel at an average speed of 15 km/h (9 mph) on the streets and highways of Caracas.  There are numerous factors contributing to the traffic problem in Caracas. According to the Venezuelan Society of Transportation Engineers, a city should allocate 20% of its public area to transportation; in Caracas, less than 12% is allocated. In 2004, fifty thousand new vehicles were sold in Caracas. In 2005, sixty thousand more were sold, and as of November, 2006, seventy thousand more had been sold.

He rolled the torn yellow paper up like a tight little spliff, then unrolled it, smoothed it out flat, and then rolled it again. I was midway through my third cup of coffee with no intention of stopping soon. I was tired and edgy, irritated at William for dragging me out at this time of night, and getting even more irritated at his refusal to get to the point. 'Did you know Philip K. Dick had a twin sister?' I stared at him blankly. 'Her name was Jane. She died shortly after their birth. They were six weeks premature,' he continued, his eyes drifting off to the window to his right. I wasn't sure if he was looking at something through it or staring at his own reflection in it. 'Dick never got over Jane's death; her ghost haunted him throughout his life, and the idea of a phantom twin pops up throughout his work. Some have even speculated that Dick's inability to make peace with the loss of his sister contributed to his drug abuse, and by extension also his death at the relatively young age of 53.' He unrolled the sweetener packet, laid it on the table, placed both index fingers together in its center, and then spread them outward, smoothing the paper flat. I reached out and slammed my own hand on top of the packet, preventing him from fiddling with it anymore. 'Sorry,' he said sheepishly. I let out a sigh.

Answer the following question: What is the missing first step of the following process:  -  Bread absorbs water from the air - Bread absorbs warmth from the air - Dust particles with mold spores fall on bread - Mold spores start to consume the bread for energy - Mold colonies grow until they are visible. Answer:","output":"The missing first step of the process is \\"Exposing the bread to a humid and warm environment.\\" To provide a detailed explanation, here are the complete steps of mold growth on bread: 1. Exposing the bread to a humid and warm environment: Bread, or any other food item for that matter, begins to develop mold when it is exposed to a conducive environment. For mold to grow, it requires warmth, moisture, and a suitable food source. By placing bread in a humid and warm area, the chances of mold growth increase significantly. 2. Bread absorbs water from the air: As bread comes into contact with moist air, its porous structure enables it to absorb water from the surrounding environment. The absorbed water provides the necessary moisture for mold growth. If the bread is stored in a particularly damp or humid area, it will absorb more water, further increasing the likelihood of mold development. 3. Bread absorbs warmth from the air: In addition to moisture, mold also requires warmth to grow. As bread absorbs warmth from its surroundings, the temperature within the bread becomes more favorable for mold growth. If the bread is stored near a heat source or in a room with a high ambient temperature, the rate of mold growth can accelerate. 4. Dust particles with mold spores fall on bread: Mold spores are microscopic organisms that are present almost everywhere, including air, surfaces, and even food. These spores may land on the bread through contact with hands, utensils, or airborne dust particles. Additionally, insects or other pests attracted to the bread may leave spore-contaminated feces on the food. 5. Mold spores start to consume the bread for energy: Once the mold spores come into contact with the moist and warm bread, they begin to germinate and form tiny structures called hyphae. Hyphae secrete enzymes that break down the bread's nutrients into simpler compounds, which are then absorbed by the mold spores to provide energy for growth. 6. Mold colonies grow until they are visible: As the mold continues to consume the bread, the number of mold spores and hyphae increases rapidly, forming a dense network called mycelium. When the mold colony reaches a certain size and density, it becomes visible to the naked eye, often appearing as green, black, or white fuzzy patches on the surface of the bread. Thus, exposing the bread to a humid and warm environment represents the missing first step in this process. By understanding these steps, precautions can be taken to reduce the likelihood of mold growth on bread, such as storing it in a cool, dry place and using clean utensils when handling it."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Image copyright Getty Images Image caption This sperm whale was one of a number stranded on this beach in the Netherlands      Large solar storms, responsible for the northern lights, may have played a role in the strandings of 29 sperm whales in the North Sea early in 2016.      A new study says these geomagnetic disruptions may have confused the whales' ability to navigate, diverting them into the shallow waters.      Trapped and lost, the whales died on European beaches, attempting to escape.      The research has been published recently in the International Journal of Astrobiology.      Mysterious losses      Researchers have been puzzled by the losses as autopsies showed that the animals were mainly well fed, young and disease-free.      The 29 strandings generated a great deal of public interest and a large number of theories among scientists.      These ranged from poisoning, to climatic changes driving prey into the North Sea which the large cetaceans followed to their doom.      Sperm whales live in deep, warm-to-temperate waters all around the world. Many groups live around the Azores in the eastern Atlantic.      When they are between 10 and 15 years old, young males head north towards the polar region, attracted by the huge quantities of squid found in the colder waters.      Image copyright Reuters Image caption Two sperm whales that washed up on a beach near Gibraltar Point in Skegness in January 2016      Their journey sometimes takes them up along the west coasts of the UK and Ireland and into the Norwegian sea. They normally return by the same route.      But in less than a month in early 2016, 29 sperm whales were found stranded on the coasts of Germany, the Netherlands, the UK and France.      Now a team of researchers say they think they understand what happened to them.      The argue that sperm whales navigate using the Earth's geomagnetic field.      Rather than being uniform, the field is stronger in some places and weaker in others, and scientists believe that species learn to read these anomalies and use them for navigation in the way that humans read contours on maps.      Dr Klaus Vanselow from the University of Kiel, Germany, and his colleagues say that large-scale solar storms may have distorted the magnetic field and caused the whales to lose their way.      Triggered by coronal mass ejections from the Sun, these storms contain large amounts of charged particles and radiation.      When they hit the Earth's upper atmosphere, they produce the spectacular displays of the polar lights over the Arctic, however the most powerful storms can also damage communications systems and satellites.      Scientists already have some evidence that solar storm activity can impact the navigating abilities of birds and bees.      Image copyright KLAUS VANSELOW Image caption This map shows the 'magnetic mountain' anomaly off the coast of Norway. The whales should have followed the white arrow but the authors argue that the solar storms made the mountains invisible and the whales instead followed the red arrow to the North Sea      Dr Vanselow and his colleagues studied the connection between whale strandings and two major solar storms that took place at the very end of December in 2015.      These produced huge displays of the Aurora Borealis that were seen in many parts of Scotland and elsewhere.      Looking specifically at the region around Shetland, the scientists found that these solar events would have caused short-term shifts in the magnetic field of up to 460km, in the area between the islands and Norway.      This could have caused sperm whales in the region to move in the wrong direction.      They also believe that sperm whales see a regular magnetic anomaly off the Norwegian coast as a \\"geomagnetic mountain chain\\", a kind of guardrail that prevents them from entering the North Sea.      The solar storms may have nullified this effect, rendering the mountain chain invisible and allowing the whales to swim through into the North Sea.      \\"Where the polar lights are seen, that's the region with the most geomagnetic disruptions on the Earth's surface,\\" Dr Vanselow told BBC News.      \\"Sperm whales are very huge animals and swim in the free ocean so if they are disrupted by this affect, they can swim in the wrong direction for days and then correct it.      \\"But in the area between Scotland and Norway, if the whales swim in the wrong direction for one or two days, then it is too late for them to go back, they are trapped.\\"      Dr Vanselow believes that his theory makes sense with the timeline of the discovery of the stranded whales up to six weeks after the storms.      He believes that because young males grow up around the Azores, an area that sees minimal impacts from solar storms, the creatures have little experience of the abrupt and powerful events that affect the poles.      Dr Vanselow's research is a theory that is very difficult, if not impossible, to prove.      However, other scientists say it is plausible.      Image copyright Getty Images Image caption This whale was beached at Hunstanton and was one of the last to die in the stranding event in early 2016      \\"It would be difficult to say that 'yes this was the cause', we would be cautious in saying that,\\" said Abbo Van Neer from the University of Hannover who carried out the autopsies on the 16 whales that stranded in Germany.      \\"But it is a valid hypothesis and a potential reason for the stranding.\\"      Nasa has also been investigating the question of whether solar storms can affect a whole range of cetaceans around the world.      A team of researchers is shortly to publish a research paper on the connection between strandings in Cape Cod and geomagnetic storms. They say the Venselow paper is \\"well founded\\".      \\"It is one potential mechanism for having animals confused, I think it's a credible theory,\\" Dr Antti Pulkkinen, who is leading the Nasa project, told BBC News.      \\"But does their paper prove that is the case? I don't think so.\\"      \\"Having looked at this problem from a data analysis point of view, it is not a single factor that contributes to this.      \\"Things need to line up from multiple different perspectives for these events to take place.\\"      Follow Matt on Twitter and on Facebook. ||||| Alerstam , T.

As Gizmodo reported at the time, the whales entered the sea’s shallow waters, where their internal sonar-like systems stopped working, causing them to become stranded and die. But scientists didn’t know why the whales entered these dangerous shallow waters in the first place.            A new team has come up with a cosmic hypothesis for the mysterious beachings: Perhaps the whales got stranded after trying to navigate using the Earth’s geomagnetic field during a solar storm. The Sun could have broken the whales’ GPS.      Advertisement      The idea is that if you have a map and a navigation system in your car, they might glitch and send you driving the wrong way, study author Klaus Henrich Vanselow from the University of Kiel in Germany told Gizmodo. “I think it’s the same for whales. They do not realize that the Sun is changing the geomagnetic environment for a short time.”      Mass sperm whale strandings have been recorded since the Middle Ages, but Vanselow was specifically interested in one that occurred in the winter of 2016, when 29 male sperm whales washed ashore in Germany, Britain, France and The Netherlands. Autopsies revealed that the whales were all healthy aside from some debris in nine of their bellies, not enough to kill them.      Vanselow realized that many animals, including cetaceans, navigate via the Earth’s magnetic field (he has studied the effect of magnetic anomalies on whale behavior in the past). The team collected data on the magnetic field’s strength and the angles it made with the Earth, and noticed that just before the strandings began, some measuring stations recorded magnetic field changes from solar storms, flares of particles blasting off of the Sun and streaming at Earth. He and his co-authors published their findings in the International Journal of Astrobiology last month.      Advertisement      The timing of a strong solar storm prior to the whale beachings led the researchers to a hypothesis. While female sperm whales remain closer to the equator to raise their calves, males swim north to feed. Perhaps, then, the males adapt to a quieter magnetic field in those more equatorial waters, making them susceptible to random and large magnetic field fluctuations from solar storms they face further north.      As the BBC notes, this paper merely offers a plausible explanation and a hypothesis about a single event that would be difficult to prove. There are plenty of other factors to take into account, such as increased whale populations due to decreased whaling pressure, earthquakes, boats and oil development. “It would be difficult to say that ‘yes this was the cause’, we would be cautious in saying that,” Abbo Van Neer from the University of Hannover, who performed some of the whale autopsies, told the BBC. “But it is a valid hypothesis and a potential reason for the stranding.” I have reached out to other researchers for further comment.      So, next time you hear about an incredibly powerful aurora borealis, keep your eyes open. You might spot some lost whales.      Advertisement      [International Journal of Astrobiology via BBC] ||||| What is a summary?","output":"A large solar storm may have been the cause of 29 sperm whales getting stranded in the North Sea in early 2016, according to a recent study published in the International Journal of Astrobiology. The study suggests that these large movements of electrical charge from the solar storms potentially disrupted the Earth's geomagnetic field, which sperm whales rely on for navigation. The unexpected change in the field strength may have thrown off the animals' navigational abilities, leading them into dangerously shallow waters and eventually causing them to be stranded on multiple European beaches. Whales like these navigators are thought to interpret anomalies in the Earth's magnetic field to navigate similar to how humans use contour lines on maps. Large solar storms have the potential to alter the Earth's magnetic field strength, which can confuse whales and potentially lead them into perilous waters. Large-scale geomagnetic disruptions, due to solar storms, have been known to cause issues with human telecommunications and satellites and have even shown to impact the navigating abilities of birds and bees. The researchers analyzed two significant solar storms at the end of December 2015, focusing on the region around the Shetland islands, a location where many young male sperm whales are known to pass by during their journey northward. The team identified these solar events as they would have caused the temporary magnetic field shifts of up to 460km, enough to disorient any whales in the region. Yet, this theory presents a Catch-22. It is difficult, if not impossible, to prove due to its cosmic and large-scale nature. Nevertheless, other scientists agree that it is logically plausible and potentially a contributing factor to the stranding. Additional research is required to fully validate this theory; however, it has sparked interest and taken us a step closer to understanding the perennial mystery surrounding whale strandings.  The main takeaway from this study adds another layer of complexity to our understanding of the interconnection between solar activity, the Earth's geomagnetic field, and the behaviors of terrestrial and marine lifeforms. It illustrates how our planet and its numerous life forms are all bound together by invisible forces within the cosmos. As we continue to study and understand these complex interactions, we will inevitably unlock fundamental secrets about our world, further enriching our respect and admiration for planet Earth and its diverse life forms."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: BEIJING, Oct. 13 (Xinhuanet) -- A recent sudden temperature drop in most areas of China has set off fears of a possible return of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the country has mobilized to prepare for another outbreak. North China's Tianjin Port resumed a temperature reporting system on Sunday. Any passengers through the port with a temperature above 38 degrees Celsius would be provided medical observation and reported to relevant authorities. Zhong Nanshan, a well-known anti-SARS scientist during the last outbreak, said it was unlikely the SARS virus would die out naturally and it would definitely come back, but predicted no widespread epidemic outbreak and the epidemic would not cause serious damage again. Caught unprepared this spring, Chinese authorities have learned to act quickly before the epidemic can take a hold. Chinese Vice-Premier Wu Yi Thursday urged strictly implementing the daily SARS epidemic reporting system and warned that people delaying reporting or hiding the true situation would be severely punished. In Beijing, the disease control center in Dongcheng District has recovered a 24 hour schedule for possible epidemic breakout. Every afternoon before 3:00 o'clock, the center receives SARS reports from every hospital in the district and then reports to the Beijing municipal disease control center and health bureau. In Beijing Xiehe Hospital, plans are ready for fever patients to receive treatment in a special section. Doctors in that ward, wearing protective clothing, will observe patients for any possible respiratory diseases. Patients with high fever and symptoms of respiratory diseases are required to be observed for one or two weeks. North China's Shanxi Province and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the two other hardest-hit areas in the last SARS crisis, have both set up an emergency response mechanism and mobilized all concerned departments.

The island of Ireland is situated to the west of it, and together these islands, along with over 1,000 smaller surrounding islands, comprise the British Isles archipelago.  - Plant morphology or phytomorphology is the study of the physical form and external structure of plants. This is usually considered distinct from plant anatomy, which is the study of the internal structure of plants, especially at the microscopic level. Plant morphology is useful in the visual identification of plants. Scope. Plant morphology \\"represents a study of the development, form, and structure of plants, and, by implication, an attempt to interpret these on the basis of similarity of plan and origin.\\" There are four major areas of investigation in plant morphology, and each overlaps with another field of the biological sciences.  - This is a list of botanical illustrators born or active in Ireland . Botanical illustration involves the painting , drawing and illustration of plants and ecosystems . Often meticulously observed , the botanical art tradition combines both science and art , and botanical artists throughout the centuries have been active in the collecting and cataloguing a huge variety of species .  - A botanical illustrator is a person who paints, sketches or otherwise illustrates botanical subjects. Typical illustrations are in watercolour, but may also be in oils, ink or pencil, or a combination of these. The image may be life size or not, the scale is often shown, and may show the habit and habitat of the plant, the upper and reverse sides of leaves, and details of flowers, bud, seed and root system.  - Earth, otherwise known as the world, is the third planet from the Sun and the only object in the Universe known to harbor life.

In ancient Ireland, it was one of the fifths ruled by a \\"rí ruirech\\", or \\"king of over-kings\\".  - Botanical illustration is the art of depicting the form, colour, and details of plant species, frequently in watercolour paintings. They must be scientifically accurate but often also have an artistic component and may be printed with a botanical description in book, magazines, and other media or sold as a work of art. Often composed in consultation with a scientific author, their creation requires an understanding of plant morphology and access to specimens and references.   - Ireland (Ulster-Scots: ) is an island in the North Atlantic. It is separated from Great Britain to its east by the North Channel, the Irish Sea, and St George's Channel. Ireland is the second-largest island of the British Isles, the third-largest in Europe, and the twentieth-largest on Earth.  - The British Isles are a group of islands off the north-western coast of continental Europe that consist of the islands of Great Britain, Ireland and over six thousand smaller isles. Situated in the North Atlantic, the islands have a total area of approximately 315,159 km, and a combined population of just under 70 million. Two sovereign states are located on the islands: Ireland (which covers roughly five-sixths of the island with the same name) and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The British Isles also include three Crown Dependencies: the Isle of Man and, by tradition, the Bailiwick of Jersey and the Bailiwick of Guernsey in the Channel Islands, although the latter are not physically a part of the archipelago.  - The Irish Sea (, , , Ulster-Scots: \\"Airish Sea\\"), separates the islands of Ireland and Great Britain. It is connected to the Celtic Sea in the south by St George's Channel, and to the Inner Seas off the West Coast of Scotland in the north by the North Channel.

The sea is occasionally, but rarely, referred to as the Manx Sea.  - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits.

I was working a shift at a chain cafe one afternoon in England, it was during the lunch rush, so we had a back up of customers lined up to the exit. See the problem with the chain is that all of our customers mostly range from midlife crisis to half-a-foot in the grave, so once a customer lines up, they don’t leave and they extend the queue. Plus this is a chain cafe so I've got a manager who's constantly on my back to speed up because someone is on her back to drive numbers up: this results in the line putting stress on my air-hostess smile, but they don't call it work for nothing. Now I'm not the only one stressed, a customer lines up during lunch, they're hungry and wish that Euclidean laws would suspend themselves so that they did not have to deal with the fact that I can't deal with a customer at the speed of light. Well one eldritch horror declares that my coffee took too long and does her rendition of the 1933 Hitler speech to the rest of the customers with an addendum that she will take her business elsewhere. Now my chain are pretty big in England, so if a customer wants to slap me around with a ‘customer is always right’ the script dictates that I do everything in my power to make sure they come back, and Cthulu knows this, well: I'm stressed, I don't like her face and she's given me an opportunity for me to give her the polite ‘fuck off'.

A quake of magnitude 7.9 is measured at the Earthquake centre, where Dr. Samantha Hill takes command, displacing Dr. Jordan Fisher. U.S. President Paul Hollister and FEMA Director Roy Nolan are informed about the situation. A magnitude 8.4 earthquake opens a crack which engulfs a train east of Redding, California. As a result, Governor Carla Williams, who had just seen her daughter and ex-husband off on a camping trip, agrees to help the Governor of Washington. Amanda Williams and her father Clark Williams arrive at a town named Browning, where everything is covered in a thick red haze. They discover a car with a dead family inside, and are nearly trapped in quicksand. Roy Nolan constructs a task force of the best geologists and seismologists, including Dr. Fisher and Dr. Hill. Dr. Hill mentions her Hidden Fault theory, and is eventually given permission to prove it. She and Dr. Fisher visit a lake, where they see some animals that died from carbon monoxide poisoning, and are almost poisoned themselves. Back at the Task Force Center, Dr. Hill predicts that the next quake will be near San Francisco, California. It is deemed too risky to evacuate the entirety of San Francisco, which is eventually destroyed by a 9.2 magnitude earthquake. After that Dr. Hill predicts the next quake will happen at the San Andreas fault, which would wipe out the West Coast in its present shape killing 50 million people on the way. Dr. Hill hypothesizes that they could \\"weld\\" the fault shut by letting it experience immense heat, which could only be created with nuclear bombs.

What is the title of this article: Boston has a continental climate with some maritime influence, and using the −3 °C (27 °F) coldest month (January) isotherm, the city lies within the transition zone from a humid subtropical climate (Köppen Cfa) to a humid continental climate (Köppen Dfa), although the suburbs north and west of the city are significantly colder in winter and solidly fall under the latter categorization; the city lies at the transition between USDA plant hardiness zones 6b (most of the city) and 7a (Downtown, South Boston, and East Boston neighborhoods). Summers are typically warm to hot, rainy, and humid, while winters oscillate between periods of cold rain and snow, with cold temperatures. Spring and fall are usually mild, with varying conditions dependent on wind direction and jet stream positioning. Prevailing wind patterns that blow offshore minimize the influence of the Atlantic Ocean. The hottest month is July, with a mean temperature of 73.4 °F (23.0 °C). The coldest month is January, with a mean of 29.0 °F (−1.7 °C). Periods exceeding 90 °F (32 °C) in summer and below freezing in winter are not uncommon but rarely extended, with about 13 and 25 days per year seeing each, respectively. The most recent sub-0 °F (−18 °C) reading occurring on February 14, 2016 when the temperature dipped down to −9 °F (−23 °C), the coldest reading since 1957. In addition, several decades may pass between 100 °F (38 °C) readings, with the most recent such occurrence on July 22, 2011 when the temperature reached 103 °F (39 °C). The city's average window for freezing temperatures is November 9 through April 5.[c] Official temperature records have ranged from −18 °F (−28 °C) on February 9, 1934, up to 104 °F (40 °C) on July 4, 1911; the record cold daily maximum is 2 °F (−17 °C) on December 30, 1917, while, conversely, the record warm daily minimum is 83 °F (28 °C) on August 2, 1975.

Summarize this article: Thomas de Maiziere said refugees could \\"not choose\\" their host countries and called on other EU states to do more. Trains between Germany and Austria have been suspended for 12 hours. Germany's vice-chancellor has said the country is \\"at the limit of its capabilities\\" as more than 13,000 migrants arrived in Munich on Saturday. Germany expects 800,000 migrants to arrive this year. \\"The aim of these measures is to limit the current inflows to Germany and to return to orderly procedures when people enter the country,\\" Mr de Maiziere told a news conference. He gave no details. The move goes against the principle of the Schengen zone, which allows free movement between many European countries. However, the agreement does allow for temporary suspensions. Germany's rail service Deutsche Bahn said train services with Austria would be stopped until 03:00GMT on Monday. Politically this is a shrewd move by Thomas de Maiziere. His announcement comes just a day before he travels to Brussels to meet other EU interior ministers to discuss the migrant crisis. The measure will help him put pressure on other European countries to do their bit. It highlights just how much Germany is struggling to cope. The move could also serve as a useful threat; after all, Mr de Maiziere said Germany was controlling the border with Austria \\"first\\", the implication being more could follow. The possibility that Germany might suddenly decide to control its other borders could well help jolt EU partners into action. For migrants, the announcement means Germany is not pursuing an open-door policy. After weeks of confusion, Berlin is now sending out the clear message that the Dublin Regulation does still hold, meaning that people have to apply for asylum in the first EU country they arrive in. After that, if Berlin gets its way, they will then be sent elsewhere in Europe according to a strict quota system. Lyse Doucet: Where does this crisis end? Caring for solo child refugees Crisis explained in graphics What next for Germany's asylum seekers? Many migrants have been refusing to register in countries such as Greece or Hungary, fearing it will stop them being granted asylum in Germany or other EU states. The city of Munich, in the German state of Bavaria, has taken the brunt of arrivals over the weekend. Bavarian Premier Horst Seehofer said the controls sent an \\"important signal\\". Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who has taken a tough line on the migrant crisis, told Germany's Bild newspaper he welcomed the new controls, saying they were \\"necessary to protect German and European values\\". On Sunday, the Czech Republic also said it would boost border controls with Austria. Europe as a whole is struggling to deal with an enormous influx of people, mostly from Syria but also Afghanistan, Eritrea and other countries, fleeing violence and poverty. On Sunday, Greek coastguards said at least 34 people, including 11 children, drowned when a boat carrying about 100 migrants capsized off the island of Farmakonisi in the southern Aegean Sea. The BBC's Lyse Doucet in Greece says it is the largest loss of life in a single incident in the Aegean since the crisis began. Earlier on Sunday, Germany's Vice-Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel, who is also economy minister, warned the country was being stretched to its limits by the new arrivals. \\"It is not just a question of the number of migrants, but also the speed at which they are arriving that makes the situation so difficult to handle,\\" he told the Tagesspiegel newspaper. Mr Gabriel also called on European countries, Gulf states and the US to give billions of euros towards schools, accommodation and food in refugee camps in the Middle East. A steady stream of migrants is travelling from Greece, through Macedonia, Serbia and Hungary, to Austria and Germany. Hungary is aiming to complete a four-metre-high (13ft) fence along the border with Serbia by 15 September, when tougher measures, including arresting illegal immigrants, come into force. The European Commission announced plans last week for mandatory quotas to share out 120,000 additional asylum seekers among 25 member countries. Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Romania are opposed to this.","output":"Germany announced last week that they are re-imposing border controls along its border with Austria, to help stem the flow of migrants.

Movie title: 300: Battle of Artemisia Movie plot: Note: this film is actually a prequel as well as a sequel to the original '300' film (with the events happening before, concurrently, and after the events of the previous film).In the opening scene, Queen Gorgo (Lena Headey) narrates about King Darius (Igal Naor) leading his army of Persians into Greece in the Battle of Marathon in 490 BC during the first Persian invasion of Greece. The Athenian general Themistocles (Sullivan Stapleton) led his own army against them at the shores. The Greeks brutally and effortlessly take down the invading Persians one by one, paving the way for Themistocles to take aim at Darius, who is watching the massacre of his men from his ship offshore. Themistocles raises a bow and arrow, ready to commit the act that would make him known as a legend. He releases the bow just in time for Darius's son, Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) to watch. He runs to his father's side but is too late to save him as the arrow pierces him. Xerxes holds his father in his arms and locks eyes with Themistocles. The latter walks away, with Gorgo stating that he knew in his heart that he made a mistake not to kill Xerxes when he had the chance.Darius is returned to his kingdom to lie in his deathbed. He and Xerxes are joined by Artemisia (Eva Green), Darius's commanding naval officer, said to be as vicious as she is beautiful. She holds Darius's hand. In his dying moments, he tells Xerxes that it is best to leave the Greeks alone, for only the gods can defeat them. Artemisia pulls the arrow out of his chest to end his suffering. For a week, Xerxes sits and mourns the death of his father. On the eighth day, Artemisia holds Xerxes and tells him that his father's last words were not a warning, but a challenge. If only the gods can defeat the Greeks, then, she tells him, he is to become the god king.Artemisia has Xerxes sent into the desert wearing chains until he walks into a cave with a pool of bright gold liquid.

A:","output":"In the movie \\"300: Battle of Artemisia,\\" which is a prequel and sequel to the original \\"300\\" film, the character Themistocles is an Athenian general who plays a significant role in the story. He is known for leading the Athenians against the Persian army during the Battle of Marathon. Throughout the film, Themistocles faces several challenges and dangers, particularly as he battles against the forces of Xerxes and Artemisia. However, there isn't a specific character who rescues Themistocles directly in this plot. He is a capable and skilled general and, for the most part, manages to navigate the challenges he faces with his own intelligence, skill, and leadership abilities. Instead, the concept of rescue and assistance among the characters can be seen as more collective in nature – the Greeks, under the guidance of leaders such as Themistocles and Queen Gorgo, work together to overcome the challenges posed by the powerful Persian army and their vengeful leaders. United in their common goal, they eventually manage to stand firm against the Persian threat and maintain their homeland's freedom. In deciding whether or not to invest in this film proposal, consider the following factors: 1. The original \\"300\\" film was well-received by audiences, and this prequel/sequel could potentially continue that success by offering familiar characters and themes in a new story. 2. The movie's plot combines aspects of ancient Greek history and mythology with exciting action sequences and intense battles, which may appeal to a broad range of viewers. 3. The central character, Themistocles, is a compelling figure who showcases bravery, intelligence, and strategic prowess throughout the film, potentially making the movie appealing to fans of strong heroes and thrilling battle scenes. 4. As a prequel and sequel, the film offers an opportunity to further explore the world and characters of the original movie, potentially drawing in audiences who enjoyed the first film and are interested in learning more about its universe. 5. The film has potential for stunning visual effects and action-oriented direction, which can be major selling points for fans of the action and epic genres. Overall, while Themistocles isn't rescued by a specific individual in \\"300: Battle of Artemisia,\\" he remains an engaging and dynamic character in a plot that combines elements of history and action-oriented storytelling. If you believe that this combination of factors would make the film a successful and profitable investment, it may be worth considering supporting the project."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

To compare it with another solution he chooses a solution that is not an acid. He labels it as solution B.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which solution has higher pH value, soution A or solution B?  Hint: If a solution has a higher concentration of hydronium ions than pure water, it has a pH lower than 7. A solution with a pH lower than 7 is called an acid . As the hydronium ion concentration increases, the pH value decreases. Therefore, the more acidic a solution is, the lower its pH value is. Did you ever taste vinegar? Like other acids, it tastes sour. Stronger acids can be harmful to organisms. For example, stomach acid would eat through the stomach if it were not lined with a layer of mucus. Strong acids can also damage materials, even hard materials such as glass. A:","output":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, we can deduce that solution A is an acid since Mike selected it while studying the properties of acids. It is also mentioned that a solution with a pH lower than 7 is an acid, and the paragraph further explains that as the concentration of hydronium ions increases, the pH value decreases. In other words, the more acidic a solution is, the lower its pH value. Now, let's consider solution B. Mike chose solution B as a comparison to solution A, specifically selecting a solution that is not an acid. As a non-acidic solution, its pH value must be either equal to or greater than 7, because solutions with a pH greater than 7 are classified as basic or alkaline, while solutions with a pH of exactly 7 are considered neutral. Comparing the pH values of the two solutions, it is clear that solution B will have a higher pH value than solution A. This is because solution A is an acid characterized by a pH value lower than 7, while solution B is not an acid leading to a pH value that is equal to or greater than 7."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Lancaster's career designing for the theatre began and ended with Gilbert and Sullivan. His first costumes and scenery were for the Sadler's Wells Ballet's Pineapple Poll (1951), John Cranko's ballet with a story based on a Gilbert poem and music by Sullivan. His last were for the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company's revival of The Sorcerer (1973). In between, he designed more productions for the Royal Ballet, as well as for Glyndebourne Festival Opera, the Old Vic and the West End. It was a matter of mild regret to him that of the twenty plays, operas and ballets that he designed between the two, only one was for a thoroughly serious piece, Britten's Peter Grimes, for the Bulgarian National Opera in Sofia in 1964.Only two of Lancaster's theatre designs have remained in use in 21st-century productions, both by the Royal Ballet: Pineapple Poll and La fille mal gardée. In an article on the latter in 2016, Danielle Buckley wrote, \\"Lancaster's surrealist and stylized designs for Fille amplify the story's pantomime quality, and the exaggerated burlesque of its comedy – but the backdrops of fields that roll into the distance, bundles of hay, dreamy skies and village cottages provide the idealized, pastoral context that the story needs\\". Buckley adds that Lancaster’s designs have been criticised for locating the ballet in no particular time or place – \\"except, that is, of a 1960s London view of idyllic country life\\".Lancaster's stated view was that stage sets and costumes should reflect reality, but \\"through a lens, magnifying and slightly over-emphasising everything which it reflects\\".

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What paras were surprised to find themselves jumping into a chest-deep swamp?  The third Chinook carried half of the enhanced A Company group from 1 PARA to Magbeni. The helicopter hovered low above the landing zone that had been identified by the second SAS observation team and the paras jumped from the rear ramp. The observation team had warned that the ground was wet but had been unable to determine the depth of the water, so the paras were surprised to find themselves jumping into a chest-deep swamp. The majority of the first group immediately waded through the swamp to get to the nearby tree line and from there to the village, but a small party tasked with securing the landing zone had to wait in the swamp for the Chinook to pick up the remaining members of the company group and return to insert them at the landing zone.The returning Chinook, carrying the remainder of the A Company group including second-in-command (2IC) Captain Danny Matthews, came under fire from a heavy machine gun in Magbeni, which was promptly strafed by one of the 657 Squadron Lynx helicopters until it ceased firing. The soldiers in Matthews' helicopter exited and joined the first half of the company group on the ground. As the company group moved forward, an explosion—possibly a mortar fired by the British fire support group—injured seven men, including company commander Major Matthew Lowe, one of the platoon commanders, a signaller, and two of Lowe's headquarters staff. Another signaller radioed in a casualty report, and one of the Chinooks en route to Gberi Bana to extract the Royal Irish (who had just been freed by the SAS) landed on the track through the village. The casualties were loaded onto the helicopter, which then picked up the Royal Irish and flew to RFA Sir Percivale where all 13 men were assessed by medics.The operation continued under the leadership of Matthews, the company 2IC, who had taken command almost immediately after the company commander was wounded.

Are these two questions asking the same thing? Select from:  1). no  2). yes","output":"Ethics, at their core, are a set of moral principles and values that guide human behavior and decision-making. They help us determine what is right or wrong and offer a framework for evaluating our actions and their consequences, both for ourselves and for others. Ethics can be shaped by a multitude of factors, including cultural, religious, and personal beliefs, and can vary from person to person. Nevertheless, society and professional fields often establish shared ethical standards and guidelines that individuals are expected to abide by to ensure harmony, fairness, and respect for the rights and well-being of others. Examples of ethics can be found in various aspects of life, such as personal relationships, workplace etiquette, and societal norms. These examples often align with concepts like honesty, integrity, empathy, and responsibility. Personal relationships: 1. Being truthful to a friend, even if the truth may be unpleasant or difficult to hear. 2. Remaining loyal and supportive during tough times. 3. Respecting the boundaries and privacy of others. 4. Apologizing and seeking to make amends after causing harm to others. Workplace etiquette: 1. Giving credit where credit is due, instead of claiming someone else’s work as your own. 2. Treating all colleagues fairly, regardless of their race, gender, or social background. 3. Ensuring a safe and non-hostile work environment for all employees. 4. Protecting the privacy and confidentiality of sensitive information. Societal norms: 1. Taking care of the environment by recycling and conserving natural resources. 2.

They are resentful of Rosy Ryan (Sarah Miles), the spoilt daughter of the local publican Tom Ryan (Leo McKern), who himself is an informer for the British army hoping to keep the peace in the village. In public, Ryan pretends to be a staunch nationalist; in an early scene, he strongly supports the recently suppressed Easter Rising, referring to the rebels as \\"our boys\\".Rosy is bored with her humdrum village life and fantasizes about the outside world much to the chagrin of the local priest, Father Hugh Collins (Trevor Howard), an old, sharp-witted and highly influential person who knows all that goes on in the village.

Q: Q: Salts are important in maintaining what balance of the blood?   A: A:","output":"Salts are crucial in maintaining the balance of the blood, particularly with regard to electrolytes. Electrolytes are minerals that break down into small, electrically charged particles called ions when dissolved in water. They are essential for several vital functions within the body, including maintaining proper fluid balance, ensuring normal muscle and nerve functions, and regulating acid-base balance (pH) in the blood. The main electrolytes found in blood are sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, chloride, bicarbonate, and phosphate. The proper balance of these electrolytes is critical for the body to function properly. For example, sodium and potassium help to maintain fluid balance within and around cells, while calcium and magnesium contribute to muscle contractions and nerve signaling. The balance of these electrolytes in the blood is maintained through several mechanisms, including: 1. Kidneys: The kidneys filter and regulate the levels of various electrolytes in the blood by either excreting excess amounts in urine or reabsorbing them as necessary. This helps to maintain a stable concentration of electrolytes in the bloodstream. 2. Hormones: Certain hormones, such as aldosterone and antidiuretic hormone (ADH), help regulate electrolyte levels in the blood by signaling the kidneys to retain or excrete specific electrolytes. 3. Diet: Consuming a well-balanced diet that includes a variety of electrolyte-rich foods, such as fruits, vegetables, nuts, and dairy products, is essential for maintaining an appropriate electrolyte balance in the blood. In summary, salts are critical in maintaining the proper balance of electrolytes in the blood, which in turn ensures normal fluid balance, muscle and nerve function, and acid-base regulation within the body."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Karadzic guilty of Bosnia genocide, jailed for 40 years THE HAGUE, March 24 (Reuters) - Former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic was sentenced to 40 years in jail by U.N judges who found him guilty of genocide for the 1995 Srebrenica massacre and of nine other war crimes charges. Karadzic, 70, the most senior political figure to be convicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia in The Hague, was found guilty of 10 out of 11 war charges. He was acquitted of a second count of genocide in various towns across Bosnia during the war of the 1990s. SEE ALSO: Surviving Paris attacks suspect wants to return to 'explain himself': Lawyer The judges said Karadzic was criminally responsible for the siege of Sarajevo and had committed crimes against humanity in Bosnian towns. They said he had intended to eliminate the Bosnian Muslim males in the town of Srebrenica, where 8,000 Muslims died in Europe's worst war crime since World War Two. Presiding judge O-Gon Kwon said the three-year Sarajevo siege, during which the city was shelled and sniped at by besieging Bosnian Serb forces, could not have happened without Karadzic's support. His sentence will be reduced by slightly more than 7 years for time already spent in detention. It will be served in an as yet undetermined state prison. He is expected to appeal, a process that could take several more years. As the judges described the siege of Sarajevo, Karadzic looked pained and his face tightened into a grimace. Victims' families in the courtroom, some of then elderly, listened intently when the genocide at Srebrenica was discussed. One wiped away tears as the judge described men and boys being separated from their families. After that, Karadzic stared ahead vacantly. When he was ordered to stand for sentencing, he listened with eyes mostly downcast. After the sentence was read and judges departed, he sat back heavily in his chair. After the hearing was closed, several victims' families embraced before quietly leaving the courtroom. Karadzic was arrested in 2008 after 11 years on the run, following a war in which 100,000 people were killed as rival armies carved Bosnia up along ethnic lines that largely survive today. He headed the self-styled Bosnian Serb Republic and was Supreme Commander of its armed forces. He said in an interview ahead of the verdict that he had worked to uphold peace and deserved praise, not punishment. \\"My permanent fight to preserve the peace, prevent the war and decrease the sufferings of everyone regardless of religion were an exemplary effort deserving respect rather than persecution,\\" he told news portal Balkan Insight. Serbian Prime Minister Aleksandar Vucic said he would stand by the Serbs of Bosnia. \\"We will stand by our people and we will protect their existence and their right to have their own state,\\" he said. ICTY prosecutor Serge Brammertz said the world had decided that victims in the former Yugoslavia deserved justice. \\"For two decades now, those victims have put their trust in us to deliver it. Thousands came here to tell their stories and courageously confront their tormentors. Today, with this conviction, that trust has been honored. Justice has been done.\\" The only more senior official to face justice before the Tribunal was the late Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, who died in custody a decade ago before a verdict was reached. Ratko Mladic, the general who commanded Bosnian Serb forces, was the last suspect to be detained over the Srebrenica slaughter and is also in a U.N. cell awaiting judgment. Munira Subasic, whose son was among the victims of Srebrenica, said the \\"verdict is very important to show new generations, especially those in Serbia who have been poisoned with hatred already, what really happened in Bosnia.\\" The Srebrenica massacre and the years-long Serb siege of Sarajevo were events that turned world opinion against the Serbs and prompted NATO air strikes that helped bring the war to an end. Karadzic defended himself through his 497-day trial and called 248 witnesses, poring over many of the millions of pages of evidence with the help of a court-appointed legal adviser. Rejecting the charges against him, Karadzic sought to portray himself as the Serbs' champion, blaming some of the sieges and shelling on Bosnian Muslims themselves. He says soldiers and civilians who committed crimes during the war acted individually. Opponents of the ICTY say its prosecutors have disproportionately targeted Serbs as 94 of 161 suspects charged were from the Serbian side, while 29 were Croat and nine Bosnian Muslim. Prosecutors have been criticized for not bringing charges against two other leaders of that era who have since died - Croatian President Franjo Tudjman and Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic. \\"If you had got prosecutions of those three (including Milosevic) then you'd get a really good picture of the way the violence was produced but we're not getting it,\\" said Eric Gordy, an expert on the court at University College London. Many Serbs, both in Bosnia and Serbia, regard the court as a pro-Western instrument, say Karadzic is innocent and believe his conviction would be an injustice for all Serbs. Their belief is strengthened by the fact that the sentencing coincides with the anniversary of the 1999 NATO bombing of Serbia that led to independence for the ethnic Albania-dominated province of Kosovo. Prosecutor Brammertz worries that its work, which is winding down, has done little to heal the war's deep wounds. \\"I'm not convinced everyone has really understood the wrongdoings from the past,\\" he said.

Karadzic was the most senior political figure to be convicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia.

Q: ROLAND HELD HIS BODY STIFF AS HE FACED THE CATHAR FORTRESS and watched the tall wooden doors swing open. He saw now that the fire of that final night's battle, now fifteen days past, had left no structure standing but the stone keep. Inside the limestone walls stood forlorn, crude shelters made of tent cloths spread over blackened beams. Cries of farewell and loud wailing came from the battlements above and from the open gateway, as the condemned emerged from the fortress, a long line of men and women in black. Roland's heartbeat broke its rhythm. During the fifteen days of grace granted under the terms of surrender, he had waited in camp with the other crusaders. Now that Diane and Perrin were safely off on the road to Paris, he felt impelled to be with the Cathars in their final moments, to bear witness. He had volunteered, despite his dread, to help escort the prisoners to their execution. Those Cathars who joined the Catholic religion would now be allowed to leave in peace, though they would be forced to give everything they owned to the Church and wear the yellow crosses for the rest of their lives. But those who clung to their faith would die. As the Cathars emerged, a man-at-arms directed each to stop at a table beside the doorway, where two Dominican friars sat with parchment scrolls. The friars recorded the name of each person about to die. This meticulous record-keeping, Roland thought, was one source of the Inquisition's power. At the head of the procession was the Cathar bishop. Bertran d'en Marti's head glowed with the red-gold rays of the low afternoon sun striking his white hair, as if it were already enveloped in flames. \\"Form around them,\\" called the leader of Roland's party. Roland reluctantly stepped forward with the other crusaders. His longsword and dagger swung heavy at his waist. He wore them only because, as a knight, he was expected to. He had left his helmet and mail shirt back in his tent. According to the above context, answer the following question. Roland was a: Select from: (1). Prisoner (2). not enough information (3).

Trivia question: Which long-running British TV series featured the characters Captain Peacock, Mrs. Slocombe, Mr. Humphries, Miss Brahms, Mr. Rumbold, Mr. Grainger and Mr. Lucas? And the answer is?","output":"The answer to the trivia question is the long-running British TV series \\"Are You Being Served?\\" which featured the characters Captain Peacock, Mrs. Slocombe, Mr. Humphries, Miss Brahms, Mr. Rumbold, Mr. Grainger, and Mr. Lucas. \\"Are You Being Served?\\" was a British sitcom set in the fictional Grace Brothers Department Store. It was created by Jeremy Lloyd and David Croft, who were also known for the popular show \\"Dad's Army.\\" Produced by the BBC, the show first aired on September 8, 1972, and ran for ten seasons, ending on April 1, 1985, with a total of 69 episodes. \\"Are You Being Served?\\" was known for its double entendres and innuendos, which earned it both praise and criticism. The show revolved around the staff of the men's and women's clothing departments, with an ensemble of characters who worked together but were often at odds with one another. The key characters played an important role in the show's success and humor: 1. Captain Stephen Peacock (played by Frank Thornton) was the floorwalker at Grace Brothers who oversaw the staff in his department and was often seen as pompous and aloof while trying to enforce order and provide customer service. 2. Mrs. Betty Slocombe (played by Mollie Sugden) was the head of the ladies' department and was known for her bright-colored hair, which changed hues each episode, and her propensity to make shocking references about her \\"pussy\\" (her cat). 3. Mr. Wilberforce Clayborne Humphries (played by John Inman) was the senior sales assistant in the men's department, known for his campy demeanor and the catchphrase, \\"I'm free!\\" He was popular among viewers and appreciated for his wit and humor. 4. Miss Shirley Brahms (played by Wendy Richard) was Mrs. Slocombe's assistant in the ladies' department and was known for her cockney accent and for being street-smart and perceptive about the department store politics. 5. Mr. Cuthbert Rumbold (played by Nicholas Smith) was the store manager who often displayed incompetence and a lack of understanding of the employees' concerns. His large ears and bald head were frequent subjects of ridicule by the staff. 6. Mr. Ernest Grainger (played by Arthur Brough) was the senior salesman in the men's department, known for his grumpy demeanor, love of routine, and commitment to customer service. 7. Mr. Dick Lucas (played by Trevor Bannister) was a junior salesman in the men's department and was known as a charming but lazy character who constantly flirted with Miss Brahms, the ladies' department assistant. \\"Are You Being Served?\\" remains a beloved classic of British TV comedy. Its characters are memorable and well-developed, and the sitcom proved to be influential for many subsequent shows. The series spawned a 1977 film adaptation and a sequel series titled \\"Grace & Favour\\" (or \\"Are You Being Served?

Help as much as you can. Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: Jonathan Swift said, “Everybody wants to live forever, but nobody wants to grow old.”  Wouldn’t it be nice if we could stay healthy and young and live as long as possible? Because that is a deep down desire of the majority, many people are always on a quest to slow down the aging process. So, our question for today is: What are the Anti-Aging Benefits of the Mediterranean Diet? First, we must acknowledge that no diet in the world can halt or slow the aging process. Aging is inevitable and food is not the elixir of life – although the type of food you choose can lengthen or shorten your life. What has been proven by numerous studies is that the Mediterranean diet lessens your risks of getting certain diseases. It also offers a range of health benefits that will allow you to age in a healthy way. When you whole-heartedly adopt the Mediterranean way of eating, you will reduce your risk of health problems such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, stroke, heart diseases, etc. That alone can be classified as anti-aging. Old age is often associated with health problems. If you can grow old and maintain your health, that would be a fine way to live. The Mediterranean diet can help you do that. Unfortunately, the standard diet for most Americans is filled with junk food, sugary sodas, fast foods and processed, additive-filled food, etc. – basically empty calories. Obesity is an epidemic. People eat whatever is the most convenient with little regard for their health. This is very upsetting and dangerous for the population as a whole. There is a wide assumption that healthy food is not delicious. People believe that to eat healthy they must live on a steady diet of raw carrots and steamed chicken breasts. As a result, they choose not to do so. They would much rather have a fast-food burger and cheese fries – it’s easier and tastier. Question: What is probably true about the author?

She was the second daughter and youngest child born to King Lysimachus from his first wife, Nicaea of Macedon. Arsinoe I had two older siblings: a brother called Agathocles and a sister called Eurydice.  - Agathocles ( Greek :  ; born between 320 -- 310s BC -- died 284 BC ) was a Greek Prince who was of Macedonian and Thessalian descent . He was the son born to Lysimachus from his first wife the Queen consort , Nicaea a daughter of the powerful regent Antipater . His full blooded siblings were his younger sisters : Eurydice and Arsinoe I. Agathocles was sent by his father against the Getae , about 292 BC , but was defeated and taken prisoner . He was kindly treated by Dromichaetes the king of the Getae , and sent back to his father with presents ; but Lysimachus , notwithstanding , marched against the Getae , and was taken prisoner himself . He too was also released by Dromichaetes , who received in consequence the daughter of Lysimachus in marriage . According to some authors it was only Agathocles and according to others only Lysimachus , who was taken prisoner . In 287 BC Agathocles was sent by his father against Demetrius I Poliorcetes , who had marched into Anatolia to deprive Lysimachus of Lydia and Caria . In this expedition he was successful ; he defeated Demetrius I and drove him out of his father 's provinces . Agathocles was destined to be the successor of Lysimachus , and was popular among his subjects . His stepmother Arsinoe II , prejudiced the mind of his father against him and after an unsuccessful attempt to poison him , Lysimachus cast him into prison and had him executed ( 284 BC ) . His maternal cousin - wife and now widow Lysandra with their children fled with Alexander ( Agathocles ' paternal half - brother ) to Seleucus I Nicator in Syria , who made war upon Lysimachus in consequence . Louis Robert has suggested that coins  of 300 BC belong to an Agathocleia city in Mysia founded by Agathocles .  - Brunei, officially the Nation of Brunei, the Abode of Peace (Jawi: ), is a sovereign state located on the north coast of the island of Borneo in Southeast Asia. Apart from its coastline with the South China Sea, the country is completely surrounded by the state of Sarawak, Malaysia. It is separated into two parts by the Sarawak district of Limbang. Brunei is the only sovereign state completely on the island of Borneo; the remainder of the island's territory is divided between the nations of Malaysia and Indonesia. Brunei's population was 408,786 in July 2012.  - A queen consort is the wife of a reigning king (or an empress consort in the case of an emperor). In Brunei, the wife of the Sultan is known as a \\"Raja Isteri\\" with prefix \\"Pengiran Anak\\", equivalent with queen consort in English, as were the consorts of tsars when Bulgaria was still a monarchy. A queen consort usually shares her husband's social rank and status. She holds the feminine equivalent of the king's monarchical titles, but historically, she does not share the king's political and military powers. A queen regnant is a queen in her own right with all the powers of a monarch, who (usually) has become queen by inheriting the throne upon the death of the previous monarch.  - Lysimachus (Greek: , \\"Lysimachos\\"; c. 360 BC  281 BC) was a Macedonian officer and diadochus (i.e. \\"successor\\") of Alexander the Great, who became a basileus (\\"King\\") in 306 BC, ruling Thrace, Asia Minor and Macedon.  - Alexander III of Macedon (20/21 July 356 BC  10/11 June 323 BC), commonly known as Alexander the Great (\\"Aléxandros ho Mégas\\" ), was a king (\\"basileus\\") of the Ancient Greek kingdom of Macedon and a member of the Argead dynasty. Born in Pella in 356 BC, Alexander succeeded his father, Philip II, to the throne at the age of twenty. He spent most of his ruling years on an unprecedented military campaign through Asia and northeast Africa, and by the age of thirty he had created one of the largest empires of the ancient world, stretching from Greece to northwestern India.

Answer: Although mature clerical script, also called 八分 (bāfēn) script, was dominant at that time, an early type of cursive script was also in use by the Han by at least as early as 24 BC (during the very late Western Han period),[b] incorporating cursive forms popular at the time, well as many elements from the vulgar writing of the Warring State of Qin.  Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion?","output":"Yes, the question is answered in a satisfactory fashion, but to provide a more detailed and long answer, let's dive deeper into the various scripts used during the Han period in China. The Han Dynasty (206 BC - 220 AD) was a time of significant cultural, political, and technological development in ancient China. In terms of writing and scripts, the Han period saw the use of multiple scripts, with some dominating official use and others being popular among the general population. 1. Clerical Script (Lishu, 隶书): As you mentioned, the mature clerical script, also called 八分 (bāfēn) script, was the dominant script in use during the Han period. This script was developed from the earlier seal script and was characterized by its stylized and simplified forms. The clerical script was predominantly used by government officials and scribes for official documents, monumental inscriptions, and stelae, making it the standard script of the time. 2. Cursive Script (Caoshu, 草书): The early form of cursive script was used alongside the clerical script by the Han Dynasty. This script was a faster and more fluid mode of writing, with characters often flowing into one another to promote rapid and efficient writing. It was particularly popular among the educated classes, who might use it for casual correspondence or taking notes. As you mentioned, by at least 24 BC, an early form of cursive script was already in use during the late Western Han period, incorporating elements from both popular cursive writing of the time and vulgar writing from the Warring State of Qin. 3. Seal Script (Zhuanshu, 篆书): Although it was more prevalent during the earlier Qin Dynasty, seal script continued to be utilized during the Han period, mainly for seals, inscriptions on bronze artifacts, and other ceremonial purposes. Seal script is characterized by its elegant, flowing lines and intricate forms, which made it less suitable for everyday use. However, it retained importance for its artistic and historical value. 4. Proto-Regular Script (Kaishu, 楷书): While regular script would not fully develop until the later Wei and Jin dynasties, some early transitional forms between the clerical script and regular script began emerging during the Han period. These proto-regular script forms represented the evolution of Chinese writing toward an even more standardized and simplified script, which would eventually become the standard form of writing in most later dynasties. In conclusion, multiple scripts were indeed used during the Han period, with the mature clerical script being the dominant form. Additionally, early cursive script, seal script, and proto-regular script were used in various capacities, contributing to the rich tapestry of written communication in ancient China."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: What is the missing first step of the following process:  -  Waste enters the kidneys - A processing moment in the kidneys let waste and fluid pass - Prevents larger molecules to pass - Fluid goes back to the bloodstream - Bad waste is removed - The final product is turned into urine. The answer is:","output":"The missing first step of the following process is: Blood containing waste products is delivered to the kidneys through the renal arteries. To provide a more detailed explanation, here is the complete process of waste filtration and urine production in the kidneys: 1. Blood containing waste products is delivered to the kidneys through the renal arteries. The renal arteries branch off from the main abdominal artery (aorta) and carry blood to each kidney. This blood contains waste products and toxins that need to be removed to maintain proper body function and acid-base balance. 2. Waste enters the kidneys: The waste-laden blood enters the nephrons, which are tiny filtering units within the kidneys. There are about a million nephrons in each kidney, and their main function is to filter the blood to remove waste products and excess substances. 3. A processing moment in the kidneys lets waste and fluid pass: As blood travels through the nephrons, a process called filtration occurs in the glomerulus - a network of capillaries at the beginning of the nephron. Waste products, excess water, and other small molecules are forced through the filtration membrane, separating them from larger molecules like proteins and blood cells. 4. Prevents larger molecules to pass: The filtration membrane of the glomerulus is a selective barrier, which prevents larger molecules such as proteins and blood cells from passing while allowing smaller molecules like waste products and water to pass into the renal tubules. 5. Fluid goes back to the bloodstream: As the filtered fluid moves through the renal tubule, essential nutrients, water, and ions are reabsorbed into the bloodstream through the process of selective reabsorption. This helps to maintain the balance of electrolytes and fluid in the body. 6. Bad waste is removed: The remaining waste products, excess water, and unabsorbed substances continue their journey along the renal tubule and then to the collecting duct. Here, more water is reabsorbed, leading to the concentration of the remaining waste products. 7. The final product is turned into urine: As the concentrated waste products, now called urine, exit the collecting ducts, they enter the renal pelvis, a funnel-shaped structure that collects the urine produced by each nephron. The urine then flows from the renal pelvis into the ureters, which are tubes that transport it to the urinary bladder, where it's stored until it's ready to be expelled from the body during urination."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize the following: Sit down and write out a timeline for your project or goal. This will help you to stay on track, and you can refer back to it when your motivation wanes. For example, if your goal is exercising, on your timeline state that you would like to be able to run a mile in one month. Then make a mini plan for how you will accomplish that goal between now and your one-month mark. Cutting up your goal into increments of time will help you stay focused and keep you from becoming overwhelmed. Control your inner dialogue and practice positive self-talk. Replace negative self-talk such as, “I can't do it,” “I'm not the best,” “I'm not smart enough,” with positive self-talk such as, “I can do it,” “I am the best,” and “I am smart; if they can do it, I can do it.” Stick with your goal by realizing that every process has an ebb and flow. Motivation is not a constant thing. There will be times when you are doing a great job of sticking to your timeline and your goals. However, other times, your motivation will wane, but know that this feeling is not a permanent, lasting feeling. Stick it out and wait for that motivation to come back. When your motivation is low, read a book or a blog about your goal. For example, if your goal is to publish a book or a journal article, read a book about writing for journals and publishers. These books have great tips for staying focused. You can also ask for support when having trouble sticking to your goal. Join an online forum, ask a friend, mentor, or a family member. Remember that talking it out will help you resolve the issue. Summary:","output":"Creating a timeline for a project or goal is essential to stay on track and maintain motivation. Break down the goal into smaller increments to avoid feeling overwhelmed. Practice positive self-talk by replacing negative thoughts with encouraging statements. Be aware that motivation may fluctuate, and during low-motivation periods, seek inspiration through reading or asking for support from friends, mentors, or online forums.

Answer:","output":"Henry Chadwick was an English-born American sportswriter, baseball statistician, and historian, born on October 5, 1824, and passed away on April 20, 1908. He played a significant role in the development of baseball and was often referred to as the \\"Father of Baseball.\\" Chadwick contributed immensely to the early days of baseball reporting, which helped the sport gain popularity. He was the editor of the first baseball guide made available for public purchase. This guide provided valuable information about the game, its rules, and its players. The publication of this guide contributed to the growth of the sport among the general public. Chadwick is also credited with the invention of box scores, a statistical summary of a baseball game. Box scores have become an essential part of documenting and understanding a game's progress and outcome. They provide insights into the performance of each player and summarize pitching, hitting, and fielding statistics. He introduced the abbreviation \\"K\\" to signify a strikeout in baseball. The use of this abbreviation has continued to this day as a way to quickly represent the occurrence of a strikeout during the game. Henry Chadwick is said to have created two vital baseball statistics - batting average and earned run average (ERA). The batting average is a measure of a hitter's performance, calculated as the total number of hits divided by official at-bats. The earned run average (ERA) is a pitching statistic that calculates the average number of earned runs a pitcher allows per nine innings pitched. These statistics are fundamental to evaluating player performance and continue to be essential metrics in baseball. In recognition of his outstanding contributions to baseball, Henry Chadwick was posthumously inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame. His legacy as an influential figure in the development of baseball and its statistics remains an essential part of the sport's history."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize: Anders Behring Breivik admits carrying out a bombing in the capital, Oslo, and going on a shooting rampage on the island of Utoeya, but denies criminal responsibility. The prosecution has asked for the 33-year-old Norwegian to be committed to psychiatric care. The defence insists he is sane. Here is a summary of events in court. The trial ended with defence lawyer Geir Lippestad arguing Breivik should be considered sane, as he had been driven by extreme politics, not violence. He also asked for his client's acquittal - a request regarded as a formality since Breivik considers his actions were justified. When Breivik himself got up to speak about his views, relatives of his victims walked out of the courtroom. The verdict will be announced on 24 August. The government announced that memorials to Breivik's victims would be built at the two attack sites. The prosecution outlined its case for recommending that Breivik should not be sent to prison but confined to psychiatric care. \\"We are not convinced or certain that Breivik is legally insane but we are in doubt,\\" said prosecutor Svein Holden. His colleague Inga Bejer Engh said: \\"We have murderers who have been sentenced to psychiatric care who will probably never get out again.\\" A psychology professor called to testify said he believed Breivik was sane. Svenn Torgersen said he agreed with the conclusions of the second court-appointed psychiatric team. He identified as a weakness the first report's focus on Breivik's childhood. Defence witnesses from the far right backed Breivik's views on Islam in court. They said Norway was threatened by Muslim immigration, an argument used by Breivik in an attempt to justify his attacks. However, the speakers did not condone Breivik's attacks. Breivik's defence said the extremists' testimony proved he was not insane because others shared his views. One of the five judges was caught on camera playing solitaire in court. In a picture published in Norwegian media, Ernst Henning Eielsen could be seen playing the card game on his computer. Breivik told the court he had been slighted by Muslims on several occasions during his childhood. Breivik took stimulants before he launched his deadly attacks, the trial heard. Expert witness Joerg Moerland, a professor of forensic toxicology, said the killer had taken a cocktail of ephedrine, caffeine and aspirin (ECA). \\"You can say that he was lightly to moderately drugged,\\" he added. Experts in far-right ideology told the trial Breivik's ideas should not be seen as the ramblings of a madman. Some of Breivik's former friends testified in court anonymously. At their request Breivik was removed from the court and watched proceedings from a nearby room. One former friend told the court how Breivik isolated himself from friends in the years leading to the attacks, and that he \\"lost the spark of life\\" and became \\"less bubbly\\". Another former friend said Breivik had worried about his looks and had a nose job in 1999 in order to look more \\"Aryan\\". Afterwards Breivik denied this was the case. Norwegian police officers described Breivik's arrest, telling the court he had asked for a plaster to cover up a minor cut and later posed like a bodybuilder when he was stripped of his fake police uniform. Police superintendent Haavard Gaasbakk described the terror of young Utoeya survivors who had mistaken the arrival of police for Breivik's fellow gunmen. He also recalled that Breivik said: \\"You are not the ones I am targeting. I consider you as brothers. It's a coup: I must save Norway from Islamisation.\\" The court heard from another survivor who came to face-to-face with Breivik but was spared because he reminded the gunman of himself. Breivik told the court that he will not appeal agaist a guilty verdict if the court finds him sane. He says he wants to be declared to sane to prove he had rational, ideological motives for the killings. The court also heard more evidence from those who survived the massacre on Utoeya. One, wheelchair-bound Mohamad Hadi Hamed, 21, told the court how his left arm and his left leg were amputated after he was shot by Breivik. Another survivor, Einar Bardal, 17, described how he was trying to escape when he heard a loud bang, followed by a loud beeping noise in in his head. Having shown little emotion during the trial, Breivik acknowledged that the witness testimony was having an effect on him and said: \\"Today I feel almost mentally damaged after having heard these testimonies.\\" Utoeya survivor Tarjei Jensen Bech, 20, likened Breivik to Voldemort, a villain in the Harry Potter novels, saying he had heard him \\"breathing and hissing\\" as he approached the spot where he shot and wounded him in the legs. \\"I like to say I've had more operations than Michael Jackson,\\" he told the court. Ylva Helene Schwenke, now 15, described for reporters how Breivik had shot her in the neck and then several more times as she lay bleeding. \\"He shoots a 14-year old girl from behind, then shoots me twice in the leg,\\" she said. \\"That's the most cowardly thing I've ever heard.\\" Another survivor, 18-year-old Andrine Johansen, told how a boy, Henrik Rasmussen, had thrown himself in the way of bullets meant to kill her. In further testimony from Utoeya survivors, Espen Myklebust told the court how he waited in the water to be rescued, after jumping into the lake and swimming out to a boat that was already full of panicking youths. Mr Myklebust, who suffered a superficial bullet wound in the back, said Breivik was \\"calm as a human being can be\\" during the attacks. \\"He walked around as if nothing had happened.\\" Another witness, Cathrine Troennes Lie, told the court about the last time she had seen her 16-year-old sister before Breivik shot and killed her. The trial continued to hear from survivors wounded during the shooting spree on Utoeya. One, Afghan-born Hussain Kazemi, told the court he saw the waters of the lake around the island red with blood after the attack. During the attack, Mr Kazemi said he briefly met Breivik, who, posing as a policeman, calmly asked him if he knew the whereabouts of the gunman. Mr Kazemi escaped by jumping into the lake as Breivik opened fire. Another witness, Martha Fevang Smith, 18, told the court how she survived being shot in the head while Breivik calmly and deliberately killed 10 others lying nearby. The trial also heard a recording of a panicked emergency call made by witness Renate Taarnes as she hid in a toilet in the camp's cafe while Breivik shot 13 people there. In further evidence from Utoeya survivors, Ingvild Leren Stensrud, told the court that she only lived because she hid under another victim's body as Breivik killed 13 people in the youth camp's cafe. After emerging from her hiding place behind the piano, Ms Stensrud then used the dead girl's phone to try to call emergency services. She also described hearing what she believes was Breivik uttering a battle cry, and that he made sure his victims were dead by delivering a control shot to their heads one by one. The court heard from more people who survived Breivik's attack on Utoeya island. Marta-Johanne Svendsen, who was shot in the arm, described hiding with others in a building known as the school house, and hearing twigs snap as Breivik tried to get in. She said she heard \\"the worst screaming\\". Another, Ina Rangoenes Libak, told how she survived by hiding behind a piano in the cafÃ© building. She was shot four times in the jaw, chest and arms. A man who swam to safety was in tears as he told the court how his friend drowned as Breivik fired on them in the water. The day had a dramatic end when a man set fire to himself outside the courthouse. He was taken to hospital with serious burns to his head and chest. The incident was not thought to be related to the trial. The court hears more testimony from survivors of the Utoeya massacre. One woman, fighting back tears, said she swam more than 600m to safety before realising she had been shot. Another witness who was shot in the lung explained how he hid by covering himself with dirt. A third witness, 20-year-old Frida Holm Skoglund, asked for Breivik to be taken out of court before she testified. She said she fled into woods and removed a bullet from her thigh, before trying to swim to safety along with others - three of whom died. Despite her trauma, Ms Skoglund declared: \\"We won, he lost!\\" There is a dramatic interruption to the trial when a brother of one of those killed throws a shoe at Breivik. The relative screamed at Breivik as he threw the shoe, which missed Breivik, hitting his defence lawyer instead. Members of the public present in the courtroom spontaneously applauded. The incident happened during the presentation of further reports from post-mortems on the victims. It prompted Breivik to reveal that someone had tried to stop him during the attack on Utoeya island by throwing an object at him which hit him in the face. The trial later resumed with more testimony from survivors of the attack on Utoeya island. Eivind Rindal described trying to escape by running through the forest on the island and how Breivik had then shot at him and some other people as they tried to flee in a rowing boat. The survivors of the attack on Utoeya island continue to give testimony. Many relatives, and one of the prosecutors, were reduced to tears as the court heard reports from post-mortems carried out on the victims. Survivor Lars Henrik Rytter Oeberg, who saw Breivik shoot and kill 14 people, described Breivik as having \\"a stone face\\" when he tried to shoot him. For the first time, the court hears testimony from those who survived the attack on Utoeya island. Labour youth leader Tonje Brenna, who organised the event targeted by Breivik, described hiding from the killer in rocks near the lake shore as the bodies of victims fell around her. Local resident Oddvar Hansen told the court how people trying to swim away from the massacre had cried and waved for help. Bjoern Ihler said he and two boys had swum to safety after Breivik approached them, pretending to be a policeman, but then calmly pulled a gun. As on previous days, Breivik remained impassive throughout the survivors' accounts, but complained about being unable to question the witnesses directly. For a third day, the court is told about the autopsies on the Utoeya massacre victims, including that of a 17-year-old girl who was attending her first Labour youth event. Another 17-year-old found dead on the island was a cheerleader at school and planned to go on study in the United States. The Breivik trial continues to hear coroners' forensic reports on those who died on Utoeya. Among the fates detailed where that of a 15-year-old boy who was the youngest to die on Utoeya. Freddy Lie, the father of a 16-year-old girl who died on the island, said his daughter had talked to him on her mobile phone just before she died. The court begins hearing coroners' reports about the autopsies on the 69 people killed on Utoeya Island. Lawyers for their families read out descriptions of those who died and showed pictures to the Oslo court. One young girl, sitting just metres away from Breivik in the courtroom, listened to how her mother died. As on previous days, Breivik seemed unmoved by the evidence. Coroner Torleiv Ole Rognum said the average age of the victims was 18. Witnesses told how they helped Breivik get to Utoeya island because they thought he was a police officer. Breivik was wearing a uniform and showed fake identification papers to a security guard at the quay, who then summoned the ferry. The ferry captain, Jon Olson, described how he helped Breivik carry a case, which proved to be full of weapons, on to the island. Mr Olson's partner was one of the first to die at the youth camp on Utoeya and his daughter was also there. The trial heard harrowing testimony from people wounded in the Oslo bomb attack. Breivik appeared unmoved as a father, Jan Erik Lund, spoke of seeing his daughter Anne Helene seriously injured in hospital. About 40,000 people gathered on a central Oslo square to sing a popular old peace song,  Children Of The Rainbow, which Breivik had mocked in court. The singer Lillebjoern Nilsen, accused by Breivik of being a Marxist who sought to brainwash children, led the singing on Youngstorget Square, close to the courthouse. Breivik sought to persuade the trial that he was sane, insisting that his actions were motivated by a political ideology, and that he was accountable for them. He dismissed an initial psychiatric report that found him insane as \\"a lie\\". He said his argument was \\"entirely logical\\" and there was \\"not the slightest possibility\\" he would be judged insane. Breivik said the compilers of the report had no experience in dealing with political extremists and, because they had spoken to him so soon after the attacks, they themselves were still in shock. Security guard Tor Inge Kristoffersen described the moment the car bomb exploded at Norway's government headquarters. He watched on CCTV as a car parked and a man wearing what looked like a guard's uniform got out. Mr Kristoffersen said: \\"Half of our screens, the images disappeared.  There was a deep rumbling, the entire block shook, the ceiling bent like water.\\" The police officer who co-ordinated the emergency response, Thor Langli, also gave evidence describing how the bomb squad searched for more bombs. He said a witness saw a small car leave the area, but he felt he could not take any officers away from the site to follow this up. He suggested if CCTV footage had been relayed live to the police, this might have saved vital minutes and could have given them the opportunity to pursue the car. On the last day of giving evidence, Breivik justified his acts as \\"a small barbarian act to prevent a larger barbarian act\\". Saying the killings had been a \\"gruesome\\" experience for him as well, he explained how he had to force himself to do something which felt so \\"against human nature\\". He offered an apology for \\"innocent\\" people who died in the Oslo bombing, referring to those who were passing by and who had no political connections. But asked if he extended that apology to those he killed on Utoeya, he said: \\"No, I do not.\\" He reiterated his belief that they were \\"legitimate targets\\", and added that there were many others in Norway \\"who deserve to be executed, eg journalists and members of parliament\\". He said he understood the loss he had inflicted on victims' families because he had lost his own family and friends after the attack. Breivik described his rampage on Utoeya in chilling detail. Before shooting his first two victims, he said he had \\"100 voices\\" in his head telling him not to do it - but pulled the trigger anyway. Displaying no emotion, Breivik said he proceeded to go to a cafe where several people were hiding, \\"completely paralysed\\" with fear. He said he reloaded his gun after running out of ammunition and killed people as they were begging for their lives. He also shot in the head others who pretended to be dead. Breivik - who was dressed as a police officer - continued his rampage around the island, luring youths from hiding places by telling them he was there to protect them. When they came out, he told the court, \\"I shot towards many of them aiming at their heads.\\" Breivik said he intended hundreds should die in his attack on the Labour Party summer camp, and that a primary target was a former prime minister, Gro Harlem Brundtland. He claimed he planned to behead Mrs Brundtland, who he thought would be on the island, and post a video of this on the internet. In fact the ex-PM left Utoeya before Breivik arrived. He also hoped his car bomb in Oslo would kill the entire government. Breivik told the court he used computer games to rehearse scenarios ahead of his attacks. He said he had planned three car bombs but opted instead for one bomb attack and one gun attack when he discovered how difficult it would be to make the bombs. The BBC's Steve Rosenberg, at the trial, said Breivik was behaving differently from his irritable performance on Wednesday and he seemed calm. He abstained from giving his usual salute as proceedings began, following a request by the defence team. The prosecution continued its cross-examination of Breivik by trying to disprove his claim of the existence of a far-right European network. They also questioned him on his supposed contacts with Serb nationalists in Liberia, and with English nationalists in London. Breivik was also questioned about his religious beliefs by a lawyer for the victims. He said he wanted to prevent the \\"de-Christianisation of Europe\\". The BBC's Matthew Price, who was in court, said Breivik appeared to be on the back foot - less relaxed than before, and more defensive. Breivik also told the court that there could be only two \\"just\\" outcomes to his trial - acquittal or the death penalty. Proceedings were delayed while the court decided to dismiss a lay judge over remarks made on a social networking site suggesting Breivik should be given the death penalty. Breivik then took the stand and delivered a 13-page statement explaining his political views. In it, he said that he would do it all again, that his actions were \\"based on goodness, not evil\\", and that he had acted to defend Norway against immigration and multiculturalism. The prosecution then began its cross-examination. They cast doubt on his membership of an organisation called Knights Templar, which they assert does not exist. His testimony and that of his witnesses was not broadcast. Anders Breivik pleaded not guilty to the charges. He told the court he \\"acknowledged\\" the acts committed, but said he did not accept criminal responsibility. He said he acted in self-defence. Dressed in a dark suit, he smiled and appeared calm as he entered the court and gave a closed-fist salute. Breivik showed no emotion as harrowing details of how he killed and injured his victims were read out, but later wiped away tears as the court was shown a video he made about multiculturalism prior to the attacks.","output":"A man named Anders Breivik did some very bad things in Norway. He set off a bomb in a city called Oslo, and then he went to an island and hurt lots of people. He did this because he didn't like some ideas that people in the government had. He had a trial where lawyers and important people talked about what happened and if he was not thinking right when he did those things. Some people wanted him to go to a special hospital for his mind, and others thought he should go to jail. The final result of the trial will be announced on August 24. They also said they will make special places to remember all the people hurt by Anders."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Question: What is the husband drawing on the woman's body? Movie plot title: Visitor Q Movie plot: The film's plot is often compared to Pier Paolo Pasolini's Teorema, in which a strange visitor to a wealthy family seduces the maid, the son, the mother, the daughter, and finally the father, before leaving a few days after, subsequently changing their lives.[5] The film starts off with a question: \\"Have you ever done it with your Dad?\\"; the viewer then sees Miki Yamazaki, a young prostitute, trying to persuade her father, Kiyoshi, into having sex with her. Her father is videotaping the scene for a documentary he is preparing on Japanese youths. Once it appears the father is letting himself be persuaded, she tells him the price (50,000 Yen). They have sex, the father ejaculates after a very short time and the disappointed daughter informs him it will be 100,000 Yen now, because of this. The father then realizes the camera has been on all along. In the next scene, called \\"Have you ever been hit on the head?\\", a man (Visitor Q) hits the father over the head with a rock for no apparent reason. The film then moves on to a scene titled \\"Have you ever hit your mom?\\" In this scene, the mother, Keiko is working on a jigsaw puzzle, and her hands are shown to have red marks, showing where she was beaten. Her young son, Takuya, comes in and starts throwing things at the already broken apartment walls because he is unhappy with the toothbrush his mother bought him. He then hits his mother with a rug beating stick. Later, bullies from the son's school come to the front of the house and shoot fireworks through the son's bedroom window. The mother is later seen injecting heroin. It does not seem to have a huge effect on her, though, suggesting she is a regular user. On his way back from work, the father is yet again hit on the head by the same man. They both arrive at the father's home and the mother serves them dinner.

The premise focuses on a specific group of individuals, \\"women,\\" and their action of \\"getting ready for a big concert\\" in a particular setting, \\"a big sub urban town.\\" It offers context to a situation that revolves around the preparation and anticipation of a significant event in a defined locale. This premise sets the stage and tells us who the primary subjects are, and what they are doing. On the other hand, the hypothesis is broader and more general, stating \\"Humans getting ready.\\" It encompasses all humans without gender or locality boundaries and focuses on a universal action of \\"getting ready.\\" This hypothesis could apply to a variety of situations and contexts where humans are preparing for something, from a concert to a party to a business meeting. Now, comparing the two, we can identify certain overlaps. The premise features a specific example where humans (in this case, women) get ready - possibly getting dressed, gathering friends, and making plans, before attending a big concert. The hypothesis, with its general statement, could potentially cover the same ground since women are a subset of humans. However, the premise in and of itself does not directly validate the hypothesis, as it only provides one particular example (women in a specific setting). There might be other examples or timelines where humans aren't \\"getting ready.\\" So, while the premise can be seen as contributing to the overall understanding or discussion surrounding the hypothesis, it cannot single-handedly confirm or refute its truthfulness.

Johnny teases his sister's fear of the cemetery after dark, saying \\"They're coming to get you, Barbra!\\" They are approached by a pale-faced man who stumbles toward them and attacks Barbra. Johnny pulls the man off of Barbra and struggles with him, but is knocked unconscious and possibly dead after tripping and hitting his head violently on the edge of a gravestone. The man then pursues Barbra back to the car, but Barbra cannot start it because the keys are in Johnny's pocket. She takes the car out of gear and it begins to drift away on its own, but she accidentally steers it into a tree. She abandons the car and runs down a roadway to a nearby farmhouse, with the man still pursuing her. She discovers the house seemingly deserted, and the phone is out of order. Her attacker stumbles around the outside of the house looking for her, and is joined by several others. They all seem to be in a kind of trance, behaving in an animalistic way. Exploring the house further, Barbra makes a gruesome find at the top of the stairs: a human body that seems to have been partially devoured by something.In a panic and attempting to flee the house, Barbra is intercepted by Ben, who arrives in a pickup truck and attacks the mysterious figures with a tire iron.

He took a deep breath, clearly gathering his thoughts before speaking. There was something about his demeanor that told Gwen this conversation was important, perhaps difficult. She nodded, signaling her understanding, and gestured for him to go on. \\"Well,\\" Albertson began, his voice slightly shaky. \\"I've been doing a lot of thinking lately. About us, about our friendship, and about how things have been between us the past few months.\\" He paused, giving Gwen a chance to take in his words. \\"I can't help but feel that maybe... Something's changed.\\" Gwen furrowed her brow, her eyes searching Albertson's face for the meaning behind his words. She couldn't deny that things hadn't been quite the same between them; the warmth and ease in their conversations seemed to have dissipated, replaced by a colder, more distant tone. There had been whispers, too - rumors circulating amongst their coworkers of tension and unresolved feelings. \\"I see,\\" she responded, trying to maintain her usual composure. \\"It's true; our friendship has faced some struggles lately. But that's normal, isn't it? People grow and change, and sometimes relationships need to adjust accordingly.\\" Albertson nodded slowly, perhaps grateful for Gwen's acknowledgment of the situation. \\"Yes, that's true. But I also think it's important for us to address any underlying issues so that we can move forward and continue to have a positive relationship.\\" Gwen considered his words for a moment, noticing a palpable vulnerability in his eyes. She sighed, knowing that he was right. Their friendship, which had once been such a source of support and camaraderie, had begun to feel like a burden. A weariness had settled between them, tinging even the most innocent interactions with an undercurrent of unspoken tensions. \\"Alright,\\" she agreed, \\"let's talk.\\" Over the next few minutes, Albertson shared his concerns and perceptions of where their friendship had gone awry. He spoke of miscommunications and moments of misunderstanding that led to hurt feelings and lingering resentments. Gwen listened intently, her own heart aching as she came to realize the extent of the impact their issues had on Albertson. When he finished, Gwen took her turn, mirroring his honesty with her own forthright admissions. She shared her fears and frustrations, the doubt that had crept into her heart over the course of their strained friendship. As their conversation unfolded, it became apparent to both of them that the root of their difficulties lay not in any particular incident or exchange but in a gradual erosion of trust and openness. They had allowed themselves to become guarded, wary of one another's intentions, and that had led to a deep-seated rift in their relationship. Determined to mend what had been broken, Gwen and Albertson agreed to make a concerted effort to rebuild their friendship. They would be more conscientious about the need for open and honest communication, and commit to resolving disputes and misunderstandings as they arose. Their conversation continued well into Albertson's break, but neither seemed to mind. The sense of urgency that had initially weighed down their exchange gradually lifted, giving way to a renewed sense of hope and anticipation for what lay ahead. As they parted ways, each feeling lighter and more optimistic than they had in months, a mutual understanding passed between them. Though the path to healing would undoubtedly be challenging, they were willing to face it together, side by side, as friends. And if there was one thing that Gwen and Albertson both knew with unwavering certainty, it was that the bond they shared was worth fighting for. After all, true friendship - the kind that transcends time and circumstance - was a rare and precious treasure.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Cosby was born on July 12, 1937 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He is one of four sons of Anna Pearl (nee Hite), a maid, and William Henry Cosby Sr., who served as a mess steward in the U.S. Navy. During much of Cosby's early childhood, his father was away from home in Navy service and especially during WWII. As a student, he described himself as a class clown. Cosby left Temple to pursue a career in comedy. He lined up standup jobs at clubs in Philadelphia and then in New York City, where he appeared at The Gaslight Cafe beginning in 1961. He booked dates in cities such as Chicago, Las Vegas, San Francisco, and Washington, D.C. In the summer of 1963, he received national exposure on NBC's The Tonight Show. This led to a recording contract with Warner Bros. Records, who, in 1964, released his debut LP Bill Cosby Is a Very Funny Fellow...Right!, the first of a series of comedy albums. His album To Russell, My Brother, Whom I Slept With was number 1 on Spin Magazines list of \\"The 40 Greatest Comedy Albums of All Time\\", calling it \\"stand-up comedy's masterpiece\\".  While many comics of the time were using the growing freedom of that decade to explore material that was controversial and sometimes risque, Cosby was making his reputation with humorous recollections of his childhood. Many Americans wondered about the absence of race as a topic in Cosby's stories. As Cosby's success grew he had to defend his choice of material regularly; as he argued, \\"A white person listens to my act and he laughs and he thinks, 'Yeah, that's the way I see it too.' Okay. He's white. I'm Negro. And we both see things the same way. That must mean that we are alike. Right? So I figure this way I'm doing as much for good race relations as the next guy.\\"  In 1983, he released the concert film Bill Cosby: Himself; it is widely regarded as \\"the greatest comedy concert film ever\\". Younger, well-established comics like Jerry Seinfeld have credited Cosby as an innovator both as a practitioner of the genre of standup comedy, as well as a person who paved the way for comics to break into sitcom television. Seinfeld said of Cosby: \\"He opened a door for all of us, for all of the networks to even consider that this was a way to create a character, was to take someone who can hold an audience just by being up there and telling their story. He created that. He created the whole idea of taking a quote-unquote 'comic' and developing a TV show just from a persona that you see on stage.\\" Comedian Larry Wilmore also saw a connection between Bill Cosby: Himself and the later success of The Cosby Show, saying: \\"It's clear that the concert is the template for The Cosby Show.\\"  Cosby performed his first TV standup special in 30 years, \\"Bill Cosby: Far From Finished\\", on Comedy Central on November 23, 2013. Cosby's last show of the \\"Far From Finished\\" tour was performed at the Cobb Energy Performing Arts Centre in Atlanta, Georgia on May 2, 2015.  In 2014, Cosby was set to release his new standup special Bill Cosby 77 on Netflix. The release of the film was canceled due to allegations of sexual assault.

King's X is an American rock band that combines progressive metal, funk and soul with vocal arrangements influenced by gospel, blues, and British Invasion rock groups. The band's lyrics are largely based on the members' struggles with religion and self-acceptance. King's X was ranked No. 83 on VH1's 100 Greatest Artists of Hard Rock. The band was moved up to Megaforce's parent label Atlantic Records for the release of their fourth album, King's X, in early 1992. However, rising tensions with Taylor led the band to eschew the upbeat approach of previous albums and turn out a darker, more introspective effort. Unfortunately, despite critical praise, their new style did not translate well among the record-buying public, thus garnering fewer sales than Faith, Hope, Love. \\"Black Flag\\", the album's lone single, received only moderate airplay on MTV and radio. Not long after the release of King's X, the band parted ways with Taylor. The details of the split were not made public, but it was believed to be rather bitter. Taylor would admit in 1996 that his company Wilde Silas MusicWorks was growing and, as a result, he was no longer giving King's X, whom he considered \\"the top dogs,\\" the attention they deserved. In the aftermath, King's X took over a year off to consider their collective future together. The band members followed other, non-musical pursuits; most notably, guitarist Ty Tabor took up semi-professional motocross motorcycle racing.  With grunge at the peak of its popularity, and Pearl Jam's bassist Jeff Ament declaring that \\"King's X invented grunge\\" (despite the group's trademark sound being very different from that of the commercially successful grunge acts), the band went looking for a new sound upon their return. They enlisted veteran producer Brendan O'Brien, who had recently produced albums for Stone Temple Pilots and Pearl Jam. The resulting album, 1994's Dogman, showcased a much more muscular and heavy sound from the group, along with less abstract and spiritual lyrics. The record received a heavier promotional push from Atlantic including a compilation promotional CD entitled: Building Blox, as King's X enjoyed a successful tour, capped by an appearance at the Woodstock '94 festival in August. They also toured in support of such bands as the Scorpions, Pearl Jam, Motley Crue and Type O Negative, but despite a return to the Top 100 for the group, the album failed to sell as well as Atlantic had hoped, and the label's support for the group quickly faded.  The band's third release under Atlantic, 1996's Ear Candy, would also be their last for the label (not including a subsequent Best of King's X compilation). Although it sold to the band's sizeable core following, it lacked the relative mainstream success of previous efforts. The record was soon out of print, and it seemed that the group's chance for commercial success had come and gone.

Working out tones and firms your muscles, which helps the skin look better.  On top of that, exercise aids in circulation which feeds skin cells with oxygen and nutrients, it dilates the skin, and reduces inflammation.  There are multiple ways exercise makes you look refreshed.  Clean your skin before you work out to help keep your pores unclogged. Keep your skin cooler and cleaner by wearing moisture-wicking clothing to get the perspiration away from your skin.  This also helps prevent acne.  Exercise in a cool environment that helps keep your body temperature down.  This can help prevent flare-ups of some skin conditions.  Apply a skin moisturizer.  Using skin moisturizer before exercise helps repel sweat, and applying afterwards – especially after swimming – helps fight dry, cracked skin and unhealthy appearance.  Exercise reduces stress and anxiety.  Feel happy about your condition, your confidence, and your fitness.  Even just 15 minutes of exercise can reduce anxiety levels. Studies have shown that alternating hot and cold treatment, even including a sauna, has great benefits.  Blood flow is increased, the metabolism speeds up, depression is minimized, and the body is stimulated.  After you're cleaned up, alternate between the coldest temperature you can tolerate, then the hottest, and finish with the coldest again. Smoking has been related through studies to a variety of skin aging issues as well as skin conditions like psoriasis.  The heat from the cigarette directly affects the skin, and the elasticity is worsened because the blood vessels are constricted.  On top of that, levels of vitamin A are reduced. Eat meals healthy for your body, those high in fiber with minimal fats, especially saturated fat.  These diets boost energy and mood, while poorer diets make you drowsy and miserable.  Choose foods with folic acid and Vitamin B12, like leafy green vegetables and beans, to reduce symptoms of depression.   Eat plenty of fruits.  Some studies have linked eating fruit to better physical health, and better feelings about personal health.  Eat fish often.  Multiple studies have linked eating plenty of seafood to lower levels of depression.  Try to fit fish with high levels of omega-3 fatty acids into your daily diet. Drink about 3 liters (0.8 US gal) of water per day.  Drinking plenty of water has been shown to increase blood flow and elasticity of the skin, making it appear thicker, moister, and healthier.","output":"Exercise is good for your skin because it helps it look better, keeps it clean, reduces stress, and when combined with a healthy diet, makes you feel good and confident."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation?  - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","output":"The scenario provided discusses the process of plant roots breaking apart rocks leading to erosion, and a potential perturbation in the form of less blood pumping, which necessitates examining the effects of this on weathering. Broadly, there are three possibilities: this perturbation can either directly impact a step of the process, indirectly impact a step, or have no impact on any given step of the process. After careful analysis, it can be determined that the supposed perturbation of \\"less blood pumping\\" will not impact any specific step of the process. To understand the reasons behind this conclusion, let's first review each step of the process in detail: 1. A plant grows near or on a rock: The process starts with the growth of a plant in the vicinity of or directly on a rock. This is a natural occurrence, and blood pumping is not an influencing factor. 2. The plant roots begin to grow: As the plant grows, so do its roots, which start to penetrate the rock's surfaces. This root growth is driven by the plant's cells, which contain water and nutrients drawn from the soil. Therefore, blood pumping is irrelevant to the plant's physiological functions. 3. Break apart the rock: As roots continue to expand, they exert pressure on the rock, fracturing it. This process depends solely on the mechanical force exerted by the roots, rather than any biological factor related to blood pumping. 4. The plant acids dissolve parts of the rock: Some plants release organic acids that can dissolve minerals within the rock. These acids are a byproduct of plant metabolism and have no correlation with blood pumping. 5. The rocks are broken into more and more pieces: As roots continue to grow and the rock weakens, it is broken down further into smaller pieces. This is a result of the pressure exerted by the roots, which, as mentioned earlier, is unrelated to blood pumping. 6. Erosion starts to occur: The smaller pieces of rock eventually become susceptible to erosion by natural forces such as wind or water. Erosion occurs independently of biological influences like blood pumping. Returning to the question of which aspect of the perturbation (less blood pumping) could potentially impact the abovementioned process, it becomes evident that blood pumping does not directly or indirectly affect any of the steps, from plant growth to rock breakdown and subsequent erosion. Blood pumping is a crucial aspect of blood circulation in animals and humans, regulating the flow of nutrients and oxygen throughout the body. However, it is irrelevant to the functioning of a plant, which has a wholly distinct biological system. Consequently, the supposed perturbation of less blood pumping does not influence any part of the process, whether directly or indirectly; it essentially does not impact any step of the weathering process involving plant roots and rocks."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

However, it was clear that what was conceived as an effort to unify was not having the intended effect.\\" Omid Safi, a professor and the head of Islamic studies at Duke, spoke on his disappointment in the school's decision to reverse its initial support for the weekly call-to-prayer for Muslim students. He expressed his concern that the controversy surrounding the issue could overshadow the more crucial and constructive conversations that need to be had about interfaith relations on college campuses. \\"We need a more nuanced and informed conversation on these important issues,\\" Safi noted. \\"I am disappointed that the call to prayer controversy has become yet another opportunity for certain sectors to depict Muslims as being 'the other,' who don't quite belong to America,\\" he added. Duke University's change of course in allowing the Muslim call to prayer provides insight into the continuing unease surrounding interfaith dialogue and inclusion in higher education institutions. While the initial intent of the university was to demonstrate its support for religious plurality, the resulting uproar served to highlight the difficulties in navigating these conversations. With an increased emphasis on inclusivity, universities across the United States and beyond must grapple with how to acknowledge and respect the diverse religious practices among their student populations."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

This provision authorizes the FBI and other law enforcement agencies to secretly conduct searches of a person's property without providing immediate notice to the property owner or occupants. The \\"sneak and peek\\" provision allows law enforcement officials to request a delayed notification search warrant from a judge, which, if granted, enables them to conduct a search while the residents are away and without their knowledge. The government is then permitted to delay notifying the individual(s) whose premises were searched for a \\"reasonable\\" period of time, which can be extended multiple times by the court if deemed necessary. This controversial provision was originally intended to be employed in terrorism-related investigations; however, over time, its usage has expanded to include other types of criminal investigations as well. Critics of the \\"sneak and peek\\" provision argue that it violates the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which protects citizens against unreasonable searches and seizures. They claim that it undermines the requirement for law enforcement agencies to provide probable cause and to obtain a warrant before conducting a search. On the other hand, proponents of the provision argue that it is a necessary tool for law enforcement to effectively combat terrorism and other serious crimes, as it prevents suspects from potentially destroying evidence or alerting co-conspirators. They also maintain that the delayed notification does not mean that the search is warrantless since law enforcement officials must still obtain a warrant from a judge and demonstrate probable cause. Overall, the \\"sneak and peek\\" provision remains one of the most contentious aspects of the USA PATRIOT Act, as it raises significant concerns regarding privacy rights, civil liberties, and the balance between national security and individual freedoms in the post-9/11 era."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Despite its highly strategic and accessible location near to the popular Yippee Noodle Bar, the eatery offers its wide range of French dishes at a rather affordable price of less than £20. This aligns with their desire to promote French food among masses, that too without putting pressure on their pockets. However, it's important to mention that the customer rating for this restaurant is on the lower side. While the reason for low ratings can be multiple varying from individual's personal tastes to quality of service, it could potentially indicate that the majority of past patrons may not have been completely satisfied with their dining experience. This could be due to the quality or authenticity of the food, the level of service provided by the staff, the ambiance, or a combination of factors.

Smear some of the juice or gel onto your sunburned lips, and let it dry. You should feel some cool relief, and the aloe will also help to heal the burn.  You can purchase aloe leaves from the produce section of some grocery stores, if you don’t have a plant at home. To get at the juice, just cut the outer green layer of the plant to reveal the wet, gel-like inner portion. Do not use an aloe gel on your lips if the instructions do not recommend it. Apply aloe as often as needed. Store your aloe or gel in the fridge for added cooling relief. Many regular lip balms are very effective at healing sunburned lips. Look for one with shea or cocoa butter along with SPF protection. That way, the balm will help clear up the sunburn and protect your lips from further sun damage.  Lip balms come in a variety of forms--tubes, sticks, and pastes. To apply lip balm, rub the tube or stick on your lips (or use your finger to rub on the paste) until they are evenly coated in a thin layer. Apply new lip balm whenever the previous layer wears off. Look for an ointment that is specifically designed for use on lips, since many topical antibiotics (and hydrocortisone creams) are not safe to ingest. Simply rub a layer of the ointment onto your lips once a day. Cook some oatmeal as you normally would. Let it cool. Dab it on your lips once a day like you would a sponge, then rinse it off. Oatmeal is a traditional skin healer that heals sunburns, so this may help heal your lips. Petroleum jelly or products containing it can cause further damage to sunburned skin, so avoid these. In addition, lotions containing pain relievers like benzocaine or lidocaine can actually irritate sunburned skin instead of providing relief, so don’t use them either.

Movie title: High School Musical Movie plot: On New Year's Eve, high school juniors Troy Bolton (Zac Efron) and Gabriella Montez (Vanessa Hudgens) meet at a party while both teens are at a ski lodge during winter break. At the party, the two are called upon to sing karaoke together (\\"Start of Something New\\"). They find that they have a connection and decide to exchange numbers before going their separate ways. One week after Christmas break, Troy sees Gabriella in his homeroom, and she explains that she just moved to Albuquerque, New Mexico and transferred to East High School over the break. Troy shows Gabriella around the school, and they pause in front of the sign-up sheet for the winter musical auditions. Drama Club president Sharpay Evans (Ashley Tisdale) arrives, assuming that Gabriella is interested in auditioning. Wanting to eliminate competition, Sharpay investigates the new girl and has the scholastic decathlon captain, Taylor McKessie (Monique Coleman), find out about Gabriella's past academic achievements, which results in Taylor and Gabriella becoming great friends. During basketball practice, Troy has trouble focusing because his thoughts are on Gabriella and the idea that he might enjoy singing more than basketball (\\"Get'cha Head in the Game\\"). Gabriella and Troy go to the musical auditions where Sharpay and her twin brother Ryan Evans (Lucas Grabeel) perform (\\"What I've Been Looking For\\"), but both are too shy to audition. When Gabriella finally gains the confidence to step forward, Troy offers to sing with her, but Ms. Darbus (Alyson Reed) tells them that they are too late.

Upon tasting the cookie, she is surprised by how delicious they are and can't help but exclaim, \\"These cookies are genius!\\" This reaction not only attests to Zeke's baking skills, but also adds a lighthearted moment to the film. To help you further in your decision to invest in the film proposal, it's important to consider several factors, such as the target audience, budget, cast, and potential for a profitable return on investment. High School Musical is a popular teen drama and musical film that has captured the hearts of many viewers since its release in 2006. With its catchy songs, engaging plot, relatable characters, and talented cast, this movie has generated a massive fan base. Investing in a similar film proposal could be beneficial if the storyline, musical numbers, and characters are well-developed, ensuring that the movie will resonate with the target audience. On the other hand, if the proposal has weak elements or doesn't distinguish itself from other films in the genre, it may not perform well at the box office. A strong marketing strategy is also crucial for a film's success. It's important to find ways to create a buzz around the project, encouraging potential viewers to engage with the movie and generate positive word of mouth. This can include social media campaigns, advertising, promotional events, and even merchandise or tie-in products, like soundtracks and novelizations. Lastly, the budget and return on investment are imperative factors to take into account when deciding whether or not to invest in a film proposal. A well-budgeted film that doesn't cost more than what it's expected to make can maximize profit for its investors. Be realistic in estimating production and marketing costs, as well as potential revenue from box office sales, home video releases, streaming deals, and other avenues. In conclusion, when considering whether to invest in a film proposal similar to High School Musical, it's important to examine various aspects like the movie's story, characters, genre, marketing strategy, budget, and long-term financial viability. By carefully weighing the pros and cons, you can make an informed decision regarding your potential investment in the proposed film project."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Donny Love was found guilty on 10 charges, including the use of a weapon of mass destruction, for the role he played in the May 4, 2008, attack on San Diego's Edward J. Schwartz Federal Courthouse.  No one was injured in the blast that damaged the building's front lobby, shattered a glass door and broke a window in a building across the street.  Love could face between 30 years and life in prison, said Assistant U.S. Attorney Fred Sheppard.  During the two-week trial, prosecutors painted Love as the mastermind behind the blast.  He directed two others, Rachelle Lynette Carlock and Ella Louise Sanders to purchase explosive powder and to steal bomb-making materials, they said. Carlock was an on-again, off-again girlfriend to Love, said Sheppard.  According to testimony, Carlock and Eric Reginald Robinson then drove from Love's house to San Diego with a backpack, containing three pipe bombs. Carlock detonated the bombs at the front doors of the courthouse, prosecutors said.  Carlock, Sanders and Robinson were charged and each previously pleaded guilty for their parts in the plan.  At the time of the bombing, Love was in \\"dire financial straits,\\" prosecutors said, and faced jail time stemming from two pending criminal cases.  \\"The evidence showed that he directed the May 4, 2008, bombing for the purpose of obtaining reward money and a break on his state charges by providing information about the bombing to law enforcement,\\" prosecutors said in a statement. , question: How long could Love get in prison?","output":"Love could face between 30 years and life in prison."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Throughout the 18th century, the watchword of translators was ease of reading. Whatever they did not understand in a text, or thought might bore readers, they omitted.

On the contrary, the premise and the hypothesis seem to contradict each other. Let's break it down and analyze it in further detail. The premise gives us the following information: 1. The subject is a woman. 2. She is wearing shades and a coat. 3. She is looking upward. The hypothesis, on the other hand, states that the woman is looking at the ground. If we take this at face value, it would mean that the woman is looking downward, as the ground is usually beneath the observer. Upon comparing the premise and the hypothesis, one can notice that the direction in which the woman is looking does not match. The premise clearly states that the woman is looking upward, while the hypothesis suggests she is looking at the ground, which is a downward direction. Therefore, based on the provided information within the premise, we cannot conclude that the hypothesis is true. Instead, we can infer that the hypothesis is likely false, given the contradiction between the woman's looking direction in the premise and the hypothesis.

Both counties had a flourishing economy.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which county used more nuclear fission to produce energy?  Hint: In the U.S., the majority of electricity is produced by burning coal or other fossil fuels. This causes air pollution, acid rain, and global warming. Fossil fuels are also limited and may eventually run out. Like fossil fuels, radioactive elements are limited. In fact, they are relatively rare, so they could run out sooner rather than later. On the other hand, nuclear fission does not release air pollution or cause the other environmental problems associated with burning fossil fuels. This is the major advantage of using nuclear fission as a source of energy. Answer:","output":"James county used more nuclear fission to produce energy.

Choose from: (i) negative (ii) positive","output":"The sentiment of the provided review can be categorized as (i) negative. To elaborate, the reviewer seems dissatisfied with several aspects of their experience. Firstly, they mention that the garlic parmesan flavor for the wings tasted more like fettuccine alfredo, implying that it was not the flavor they were expecting or hoping for. They also compare the food to another establishment, Buffalo Wild Wings (BWW), which is a common reference for wings. The reviewer suggests that although BWW might have better sauce, their chicken is smaller, indicating that the size of the chicken at the reviewed establishment is better. However, this comparison is not positive, considering the dissatisfaction with the flavor. Additionally, the reviewer expresses disappointment with the pizza, describing it as \\"fair\\" and stating that they had experienced better. They continue on to say that after eating two wings, the overall meal was ruined for them. This shows that their dissatisfaction with the wings had a negative impact on their perception of the overall meal, further emphasizing their negative sentiment. Lastly, the reviewer concludes by stating that they wouldn't eat at the establishment again and that they would have been better off ordering food from street cart workers in California. This statement clearly demonstrates discontent and a lack of willingness to give the establishment another chance. Overall, based on these points and the negative emotions expressed throughout the review, the sentiment can confidently be identified as negative."},{"instruction":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. What is the solution? Solve -115*u - 39*u - 1723 + 1736 = -6917 for u.","output":"Alright, let's solve the equation step by step. First, we need to combine the terms with the letter \\"u\\". We have -115*u and -39*u. If we add these two together, we get: -115*u + (-39*u) = -154*u Now our equation looks like this: -154*u - 1723 + 1736 = -6917 Next, let's deal with the numbers. We have -1723 and +1736. If we add these two together, we get: -1723 + 1736 = 13 Now our equation looks like this: -154*u + 13 = -6917 To solve for \\"u\\", we need to get \\"u\\" all by itself. Right now, we have \\"+ 13\\" on the left side of the equation, but we want it on the right side. We can do this by subtracting 13 from both sides: -154*u + 13 - 13 = -6917 - 13 => -154*u = -6930 Now we just have one last step to solve for \\"u\\". We need to divide both sides of the equation by -154: (-154*u) / (-154) = (-6930) / (-154) => u = 45 So, the solution to the equation is u = 45."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Given the question: Information:  - A screenplay writer, screenwriter for short, scriptwriter or scenarist is a writer who practices the craft of screenwriting, writing screenplays on which mass media such as films, television programs, comics or video games are based.  - Anarkali (; \\"Anrkal \\") (pomegranate blossom), born as Sharif un-Nissa, and also known as Nadira Begum, was a legendary slave girl. It is depicted in the Bollywood movie Mughal-e-Azam that during the Mughal period, she was supposedly ordered to be buried alive between two walls by Mughal emperor Akbar for having an illicit relationship with the Crown-Prince Salim, later to become Emperor Jahangir. Due to the lack of evidence and sources, the story of Anarkali is considered by some to be false for the evidence of her grave and body. The story of Anarkali is not mentioned in the Akbarnama nor in Tuzuk-e-Jahangiri. It was first mentioned by an English tourist and trader William Finch in his journal, who visited India on 24 August 1608. The story was originally written by Indian writer Abdul Halim Sharar and on the first page of that book he had clearly mentioned it to be a work of fiction. Nevertheless, her story has been adapted into literature, art and cinema.  - Abu'l-Fath Jalal ud-din Muhammad Akbar, popularly known as Akbar I (literally \\"the great\\"; 15 October 1542 27 October 1605) and later Akbar the Great (Urdu:  ; literally \\"Great the Great\\"), was Mughal Emperor from 1556 until his death. He was the third and one of the greatest rulers of the Mughal Dynasty in India. Akbar succeeded his father, Humayun, under a regent, Bairam Khan, who helped the young emperor expand and consolidate Mughal domains in India. A strong personality and a successful general, Akbar gradually enlarged the Mughal Empire to include nearly all of the Indian Subcontinent north of the Godavari river. His power and influence, however, extended over the entire country because of Mughal military, political, cultural, and economic dominance. To unify the vast Mughal state, Akbar established a centralised system of administration throughout his empire and adopted a policy of conciliating conquered rulers through marriage and diplomacy. To preserve peace and order in a religiously and culturally diverse empire, he adopted policies that won him the support of his non-Muslim subjects. Eschewing tribal bonds and Islamic state identity, Akbar strived to unite far-flung lands of his realm through loyalty, expressed through a Persianised culture, to himself as an emperor who had near-divine status.  - A writer is a person who uses written words in various styles and techniques to communicate their ideas.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the name of the person that taught composition at the Leningrad Conservatory?  The composer's response to his denunciation was the Fifth Symphony of 1937, which was musically more conservative than his earlier works. Premiered on 21 November 1937 in Leningrad, it was a phenomenal success. The Fifth brought many to tears and welling emotions. Later, Shostakovich's purported memoir, Testimony, stated: \\"I'll never believe that a man who understood nothing could feel the Fifth Symphony. Of course they understood, they understood what was happening around them and they understood what the Fifth was about.\\"The success put Shostakovich in good standing once again. Music critics and the authorities alike, including those who had earlier accused Shostakovich of formalism, claimed that he had learned from his mistakes and become a true Soviet artist. In a newspaper article published under Shostakovich's name, the Fifth Symphony was characterized as \\"A Soviet artist's creative response to just criticism.\\" The composer Dmitry Kabalevsky, who had been among those who disassociated themselves from Shostakovich when the Pravda article was published, praised the Fifth Symphony and congratulated Shostakovich for \\"not having given in to the seductive temptations of his previous 'erroneous' ways.\\"It was also at this time that Shostakovich composed the first of his string quartets. His chamber works allowed him to experiment and express ideas that would have been unacceptable in his more public symphonies.

Which one of these answers best answers the question according to the context?  A: look for other traps  B: lay out the trap  C: walk the trail Answer:","output":"Based on the given context, answer A: look for other traps best answers the question regarding what Jordan would want to do next. This is because Jordan has displayed concern for safety by carefully removing a trap from the trail, which suggests that they want to ensure their own safety and potentially the safety of others. As such, it would be reasonable to assume that Jordan would want to continue looking for other traps along the trail to further reduce the risk of anyone accidentally getting caught. Answer B: lay out the trap is not the most suitable answer. This option implies that Jordan might intend to set up the trap again after removing it, which contradicts their initial action of ensuring safety for themselves and others by removing the trap in the first place. Answer C: walk the trail could potentially be an appropriate answer, but it does not provide the best answer to the question according to the given context. Although walking the trail might be an objective for Jordan, it would make more sense for them to prioritize looking for other traps first, as this action aligns with their concern for safety and their initial action of removing a trap.

The revolt was sparked by the 1541 decree of Châtellerault, which extended a salt tax to Angoumois and Saintonge . It was made compulsory to purchase salt from the salt loft . \\"Gabelle\\" officers took charge of punishing the unlawful trading of salt. But these were salt pan areas where the salt was freely traded. Salt smuggling  spread rapidly, especially after the Marennes and La Rochelle revolts in 1542, and the repression by the salt riders is out of the population acceptance. In 1548, riots break out in Angoumois and Saintonge demanding the release of the smugglers . The de Pitauds revolt grew to 20,000 members, led by a lord and joined by priests. Castles were plundered and salt-tax collectors killed. The revolt spread to Bordeaux where 20 salt tax collectors were killed, including the lieutenant governor, on August 21, 1548. King Henry II blockaded Bordeaux and launched his repression. Bordeaux lost its privileges. It was disarmed, paid a fine, saw its parliament suspended, and 1,401 people were sentenced to death. The repression spread to the countryside where the leaders were hanged: neither priests nor gentlemen were spared. The salt-tax was finally abolished in these provinces in June 1549, the provinces became redeemed countries, and the King issued a general amnesty.

Finding your passion is not always easy, but that doesn't make it any less worth doing. This needs to be one of the guiding principles of your life if you want to make it better-- you only have one life to live, so spend it doing things you love.  Make a list of your favorite activities. What is most important to you in life, friends, family, fulfillment, a good job? Plan around these important causes. While everyone has to do things \\"just to survive,\\" these jobs will be easier to get through if you are also working towards a long-term dream. Make a list of tangible, real goals and commit to achieving them. This gives you milestones to reach for and makes bettering your life an attainable adventure, not a series of confused stabs in the dark. Goals can be big, like running your own company, or small, like exercising every day. Just make sure you know what you want to change before you start changing. Once you have goals it's time to make them a reality, one small step at a time. Draft a list of the things you need to do to make your dreams come true. For example, if you want to be a TV show writer, you might:  Learn how to write scripts. Write and edit your first TV pilot. Submit your pilot to contests and fellowships. Move to LA to learn the industry. Keep writing new pilots until one gets picked up. The only way to improve is to learn, so find time to teach yourself something new every day. Be humble enough to ask for advice or guidance from friends and experts as you grow as a person and a professional.  Read/watch the news daily. Read a book. Learn a new word. Anything that makes you smarter than the day before is something to be proud of.  Even people happy with their jobs can benefit from continued education, as it makes you a better person with more insight and wisdom. Consider night school or online classes if you want to change careers but can't afford to quit work just yet. Listen more, talk less. You'll be surprised what people have to offer you. Work for the job you want, not the one you have. When your Manager/Boss realizes that you are eager to learn, you will move up the ladder in no time. Do the best you can on any project or assignment you are given and be willing to help your coworkers when they need a hand. If you exude positive, hardworking vibes, someone will eventually notice. Crafting a happy, fulfilling future does not take place overnight. Some experts have estimated that it takes 10,000 hours to reach true mastery in any subject, which means you have to work hard to reach the future you want. But if you are truly happy doing something, the work required to get there should not feel like a chore.  Focus on your goals and the steps needed to reach them. Celebrate little milestones on your way to your better future life. Know that setbacks happen, but handling them positively will bring your closer to your goals.

Hull Barret The answer to this question is:","output":"Title: The Depths of Redemption Genre: Action, Adventure, Drama Plot Summary: Hull Barret, a strong and determined leader of a group of miners, is on the verge of making the biggest discovery on the mountain – a hidden gold mine that could change the lives of the entire mining community. However, underlying tensions and external threats test the unity and resilience of the miners as Barret navigates them through countless trials and tribulations while uncovering shocking secrets from his past. Act One: Hull Barret, the leader of a close-knit group of miners, gets a sudden strike of luck when he discovers a new and untapped vein of gold during a routine excavation. His group revels in the find, and they finally see a light at the end of the unrelenting hardships they faced through their mining years. The news of this valuable discovery quickly spreads through the isolated mining town, and soon enough, the entire community is aware of the newfound riches buried beneath the earth. Act Two: However, with newfound wealth comes the greed of external parties. A ruthless and corrupt mining company known as Rockstone Industries learns of the deposit and is determined to siphon off the gold, no matter the cost. Their arrival in the mining town leads to major conflicts as Barret rallies the miners against the invasive company. Simultaneously, Barret's past comes back to haunt him, as it is revealed that he was once a high-ranking member of Rockstone Industries. He had left the company after realizing their morally corrupt practices and sought redemption by becoming a humble miner. The conflict becomes personal, as Barret is forced to confront his old adversaries while protecting the mining community from their exploitation. Throughout the struggle, in-fighting erupts among the miners, as some are seduced by the promises of Rockstone Industries, while others remain loyal to Barret. Fights break out between the groups, and the community is driven through a civil war as Barret scrambles to maintain order. Act Three: In the climactic final act, Barret and the miners successfully infiltrate Rockstone Industries' headquarters in a thrilling show of bravery and force. They discover and expose the company's illegal and unethical practices, leading to the collapse of the corporation. However, as they return to their mining community, they realize that the gold discovery has created an unbridgeable divide among the people. Barret, with a heavy heart, decides to keep the gold vein hidden away, and he uses the newfound wealth to compensate and retrain the miners for new professions. In an emotional conclusion, the mining town slowly transitions from a hub of mining activity to a thriving community based on unity and brotherhood, with new industries and opportunities finally replacing the dangerous dependency on gold. Hull Barret remains the heart of the town, remembered as a symbol of integrity and self-sacrifice, thus redeeming himself from his past mistakes and paving the way for a brighter collective future."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer this question: Guy Fawkes was born and schooled in which English city?","output":"Guy Fawkes, also known as Guido Fawkes, was born and schooled in the English city of York. York is located in the northeastern part of England, and it is known for its rich history and well-preserved architecture, including the famous historical landmarks such as York Minster, Clifford's Tower, and the city walls. Guy Fawkes was born on April 13, 1570, to Edward Fawkes and Edith Blake-Fawkes. His father was a proctor and an advocate of the consistory court of the diocese of York. Guy Fawkes' family was part of the Church of England, but his maternal grandparents were recusant Catholics, who refused to conform to the Anglican Church. Fawkes attended St. Peter's School in York, which was a prestigious institution known for providing a solid education. It was during his time at this school that Fawkes likely became acquainted with Catholicism, as some of the school's faculty were known to be Catholics or have sympathy for the Catholic faith. Despite his exposure to Catholicism at school, Fawkes initially followed in his family's footsteps and was a member of the Church of England. It wasn't until later in his life, after the death of his father and his mother's remarriage to a Catholic man, that Fawkes became more deeply involved in the Catholic faith and ultimately joined the cause to restore Catholicism as the dominant religion in England. This dedication to the Catholic faith emboldened Guy Fawkes to participate in the infamous Gunpowder Plot. In 1605, along with a group of English Catholics led by Robert Catesby, Fawkes plotted to assassinate King James I, who was a Protestant, by blowing up the Houses of Parliament during its State Opening. The ultimate goal was to replace King James I with his Catholic daughter, Princess Elizabeth, and to end the repression of Catholics in England. However, the plot was discovered before it could be executed, and Fawkes along with his fellow conspirators was arrested, tried, and executed for high treason. In conclusion, Guy Fawkes was born and schooled in York, a city with a rich cultural and historical background. His early exposure to Catholicism at school and in his family eventually led him to participate in one of the most notorious failed plots in British history. Despite the dark legacy associated with Guy Fawkes and the Gunpowder Plot, his story remains an important part of English history and serves as a reminder of the religious tensions that existed in 17th-century England."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Read the following context and answer the question. Context: In September, a new and widely advertised school opened its doors in the capital city - the Part-time Evening Elementary School. You could read in its beautifully printed brochure that the school was designed to help all those \\"children of wealthy parents, who are too busy to learn during the day due to the time spent on the difficult task of maintaining our country's high ranking in the very competitive field of computer games.\\" In other words: when a parent wanted to have some peace and quiet, he or she would leave the kid at home in front of the computer with a bag of chips. When the kid had enough, which normally happened in the evening, he would go to school for about two hours. The creator of PEES and its first principal was Krzycho Jedynak, a former junior high PE teacher in Potylica, a computer games fan and the winner of, as we could read in the beautifully printer brochure, \\"a local Amiga gaming championship\\". Understanding exactly the needs of his future students, he planned to open classes of the following profiles: platform PSP (one group), platform PC (three groups), platform GB (one) and platform Mac (cancelled due to a lack of interest). The school received an astonishing number of applications (four for each spot), which meant that many kids spent their days playing computer games and that many parents wanted time for themselves. To be accepted, young candidates had to demonstrate their social and psychological maturity and computer instincts, evaluated according to a patented method developed by Mr. Jedynak. The parents, on the other hand, had to pass an exam in using a joystick and provide a proof of income of at least 7000 zloty per month for a young family member. During the registration process was so competitive, it ended in violence. A disappointed father of a child who didn't get in, shouted that only VIP brats had been accepted, for which he got hit in the face by editor Furtok, in private - a father of a kid who got in to group B2/platform PC.

If \\"A lady in winter wear carrying a purse walks down the sidewalk.\\", does this mean that \\"A lady in winter wear carrying a purse walks outside.\\"?","output":"Yes, the statement \\"A lady in winter wear carrying a purse walks down the sidewalk\\" implies that \\"A lady in winter wear carrying a purse walks outside.\\" To provide a more in-depth analysis and explanation, let's break down the elements of the original statement. 1. \\"A lady\\": This refers to an adult female person. 2. \\"in winter wear\\": This speaks to the clothing the lady is wearing and indicates that she is dressed in clothes suited for cold weather. Winter wear typically includes items such as coats, scarves, gloves, and boots to keep a person warm. 3. \\"carrying a purse\\": This means that the lady is carrying a bag or pouch, typically used to carry personal belongings like a wallet, keys, or phone, and possibly some other personal items. 4. \\"walks down the sidewalk\\": This is the primary action that takes place in the statement. 'Sidewalk' is a paved footpath designed for pedestrians, usually found alongside roads or streets in populated areas. This element suggests that the lady is walking on a pedestrian path outdoors. Now, let's break down the elements of the second statement: 1. \\"A lady\\": This again refers to an adult female person. 2. \\"in winter wear\\": This also indicates that she is dressed in clothes suited for cold weather. 3. \\"carrying a purse\\": This means that the lady is again carrying a bag or pouch, where she might be keeping her personal belongings. 4. \\"walks outside\\": This is the primary action described in this statement. The term 'outside' refers to being in the open air and not within a building or another form of shelter. Walking outside suggests that the lady is in an outdoor environment. Comparing the two statements, we can see that their main difference lies in the terms used to describe the location of the lady. In the first statement, the lady is described as walking \\"down the sidewalk,\\" while in the second statement, she is described as walking \\"outside.\\" Since sidewalks are by their nature located outside, the two statements describe essentially the same action—the lady walking outdoors while wearing winter clothes and carrying a purse. Therefore, \\"A lady in winter wear carrying a purse walks down the sidewalk\\" does mean \\"A lady in winter wear carrying a purse walks outside.\\""},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Write a summary based on this article: Scientists have discovered three new species of dragon-esque woodlizards in the Andes of Peru and Ecuador. The new species differ from their closest relatives in scale features, coloration and DNA. The study was published in the open access journal ZooKeys.      Field and laboratory work by Omar Torres-Carvajal (Museo de Zoología QCAZ, Ecuador), Pablo J. Venegas (CORBIDI, Peru), and Kevin de Queiroz (Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History, U.S.A) has resulted in the discovery of three new species of dragon-esque woodlizards from Andean cloudforests in Ecuador and Peru.      The unusual discoveries took place in areas within the 1,542,644 km2 Tropical Andes hotspot, western South America.      Finding three new species of woodlizards is a striking fact given that they are among the largest and most colorful lizards in South American forests.      Woodlizards (Enyalioides) are diurnal and live in lowland tropical rainforests, such as the Chocó and western Amazon basin, as well as cloudforests on both sides of the Andes. The new species described by Torres-Carvajal et al. increases the number of species of woodlizards to 15.      Recent expeditions to several localities along the Andes of Ecuador and Peru led to the collection of several specimens of woodlizards, which the authors suspected were something new. After comparing the new specimens with those deposited in several natural history museums from many countries, the author's suspicions became stronger.      When the authors looked at DNA evidence, there were no doubts that the specimens collected recently belonged to three undescribed species of woodlizards.      'I started working with woodlizards in 2006 as part of my postdoc at the Smithsonian Institution under the direction of Kevin de Queiroz. At that time only seven species of woodlizards had been described, and they were recognized in the literature as one of the less diverse groups of South American lizards. During the last few years we doubled the number of known species of woodlizards, showing that the diversity of these conspicuous reptiles had been underestimated. That more than half of the diversity of a group of large, dragon-looking reptiles from South America has been discovered in recent years should be heard by people in charge of conservation and funding agencies' said Dr. Torres-Carvajal.      #      Original source:      Torres-Carvajal O, Venegas PJ, Queiroz K (2015) Three new species of woodlizards (Hoplocercinae, Enyalioides) from northwestern South America.

Woodlizards are often described as miniature dragons because of their probing eyes, richly patterned skin and rows of spikelike scales. Until now, only 12 species of the genus Enyalioides were known, and five of those were discovered in just the past seven years.      They're not exactly \\"Game of Thrones\\" dragons, but woodlizards have occasionally been compared to the mythical beasts because of their spiky scales and probing eyes. This newly discovered species, dubbed Enyalioides anisolepis, is only about 5 inches (13 centimeters) long. It lives in the cloud forests of northern Peru and southern Ecuador. Omar Torres-Carvajal      The three new species were found in the cloud forests of Peru and Ecuador, an international research team reported Monday in the journal ZooKeys. These high-altitude tropical forests are permanently shrouded in fog and mist, creating an otherworldly environment that abounds in biological diversity. [In Photos: Life Up in the Clouds]      The team, led by Omar Torres-Carvajal of the Museo de Zoología QCAZ in Ecuador, also ferreted out the five other woodlizard species recorded in recent years. \\"The diversity of these conspicuous reptiles has been underestimated,\\" Torres-Carvajal said in a statement.      Woodlizards grow to be between 3 and 6 inches (7 to 15 centimeters) long, making them one of the largest lizards in the Amazon rainforest. The lizards' colors and patterns help them blend into the environment, the researchers said.      This adult female specimen, found in Ecuador, represents a new species of woodlizard dubbed Enyalioides altotambo. Both males and females resemble the thick-necked, warty dragon named Gronckle from the 2010 film \\"How to Train Your Dragon.\\" Luis A. Coloma      Each of the three new species differs from its relatives by body characteristics such as color, scale shape and size, as well as their mitochondrial DNA, the study reported. The new species were named E. sophiarothschildae, after Sophia Rothschild, a donor to Germany's BIOPAT program; E. anisolepis, which refers to the Greek term for \\"unequal scales\\"; and E. altotambo, after Alto Tambo, the Ecuadorean town where the bright green lizard was found.      — Becky Oskin, LiveScience      This is a condensed version of a report from LiveScience.

Answer the following question: Background: Sometimes muscles and tendons get injured when a person starts doing an activity before they have warmed up properly. A warm up is a slow increase in the intensity of a physical activity that prepares muscles for an activity. Warming up increases the blood flow to the muscles and increases the heart rate. Warmed-up muscles and tendons are less likely to get injured. For example, before running or playing soccer, a person might jog slowly to warm muscles and increase their heart rate. Even elite athletes need to warm up ( Figure below ).  Paragraph: Tom and Jim go running together once a week. This week Jim skipped his warm up before exercising, because he was a bit late. Tom warmed up properly before running.  Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which runner has a greater chance of getting a tendon injury? Answer:","output":"Based on the provided information and context, Jim, who skipped his warm-up before exercising, has a greater chance of getting a tendon injury compared to Tom.  To understand why this is the case, it's essential to recognize the importance of warm-ups in physical activities like running. When a person warms up properly, they gradually increase the intensity of the activity, preparing the muscles and tendons for the demands of the exercise, and reducing the likelihood of injury. Warm-ups serve several purposes, including: 1. Increasing blood flow to the muscles: As the heart rate goes up, blood flow improves, ensuring that the muscles receive an adequate supply of oxygen and nutrients. This boosts muscle and tendon performance during the exercise. 2. Enhancing flexibility and range of motion: A warm-up loosens the muscles and tendons, making them more pliable and less susceptible to strains or tears when they are suddenly stretched during physical activity. 3. Elevating body temperature: Warming up the muscles can help reduce the risk of injury, as warmed-up muscles can absorb shock and load better than cold muscles. 4. Mentally preparing the individual: A warm-up routine also serves as a mental preparation for the physical activity ahead, helping the individual to focus on the task, identify potential sources of strain, and make any necessary adjustments to technique or body mechanics. In the case of Tom and Jim, since Jim did not warm up before engaging in the exercise, his muscles and tendons were not properly prepared for the demands of running. Consequently, his body was more prone to injury, and he had a greater chance of experiencing a tendon injury than Tom, who warmed up appropriately before running."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: The Jets played a rare road game at home, as they took on their intracity rivals (and stadium co-tenants), the New York Giants. Both offenses were slow to start through the first quarter, though the Jets' defense capitalized when Giants running back Brandon Jacobs fumbled at his own 11-yard line, which was picked up by safety Kerry Rhodes for a touchdown. The Jets had a chance to extend the lead later in the period, but Mike Nugent missed a 42-yard field goal. The Giants responded on the ensuing drive with an eight-yard touchdown by Derrick Ward. The deadlock was broken toward the end of the first half when Chad Pennington led the Jets on a 93-yard drive with less than two minutes in the half, ending on a 16-yard touchdown pass to Brad Smith. The Jets were able to tack on a 47-yard field goal by Nugent to end the half, after they got the ball back on an interception of Giants quarterback Eli Manning by Jonathan Vilma, taking a 17-7 lead into the locker room. The Giants went to work when they opened the second half, getting a 19-yard touchdown run from Jacobs to cut the Jets' lead to three. The lead was restored back to ten, however, when Leon Washington returned the ensuing kickoff 98&#160;yards for a touchdown. Later in the quarter, Manning led the Giants downfield and completed a 13-yard pass to tight end Jeremy Shockey for a touchdown. Pennington attempted to respond by leading the Jets deep into Giants territory early in the fourth quarter, but he floated a pass toward the end zone which was intercepted at the two-yard line by cornerback Aaron Ross. Despite the bad field position, Manning eventually found Plaxico Burress on a 53-yard touchdown pass to put the Giants ahead, 28-24. The Jets tried to get back ahead later in the period, but Pennington was intercepted again by Ross (Pennington's third of the afternoon), who took it 43&#160;yards for what was effectively the game-sealing touchdown. One last attempt by the Jets to score yielded no positive yardage, and the Giants ran out the clock to preserve the victory. Question: How many yards did Mike Nugent kick for successful field goals?

Movie Title: Disastrous Dreams Disastrous Dreams hit theaters with a tantalizing trailer, promising an action-packed, edge-of-your-seat experience. However, the unrealistic plot, lackluster performances, and poor attention to detail thwarted any potential it may have held. Here is a breakdown of the film's failings: 1. Unbelievable storyline: A step-by-step walk through the plot reveals several glaring inconsistencies. It's hard for any viewer to accept that a time-traveling smartwatch, powered by a potato, can save humanity from an alien invasion. The concept itself is difficult to take seriously, making it challenging for the audience to become immersed in the story world. 2. Lackluster performances: The casting decisions for Disastrous Dreams were, to put it mildly, misguided. The lead actor appeared to be more focused on flexing his muscles than portraying an emotional connection with the audience. Additionally, supporting characters constantly shifted accents, leaving one to wonder about their origins and intentions. This was distracting and further detracted from the storyline. 3. Poorly executed special effects: The visual effects in Disastrous Dreams were a disappointment. The alien invaders appeared almost cartoonish, making it impossible to take them seriously as a threat to humanity. Moreover, the time-travel sequences were jarring, bearing an uncanny resemblance to a PowerPoint presentation. 4. Predictable clichés: The film's script included a plethora of overused movie tropes, constantly reminding the viewer they were watching a subpar attempt at a blockbuster. From the last-minute rescue scenes, to the tacked-on love interest subplot, the unimaginative narrative rehashed tired ideas instead of exploring fresh, compelling ones. 5. Rushed conclusion: In a desperate attempt to wrap up the plot, the climax of Disastrous Dreams was confusing and unsatisfying. The hasty resolution prevented the audience from experiencing the thrill that an action-packed finale should deliver. A baffling, unexplained twist left viewers scratching their heads rather than clamoring for a potential sequel. In conclusion, Disastrous Dreams had all the makings of a thrilling, audience-pleasing film but was undermined by its poorly-executed premise and disregard for credibility. It would be best to avoid this film and invest your viewing hours in a more deserving and well-executed production."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

While Walker is taking a shower, his wife mysteriously disappears from their hotel room.Still jet-lagged, he searches for her in the hotel with the help of a polite but mostly indifferent staff and then wanders outside to search himself. A vagrant overhears him in a café and says he saw Walker's wife being forced into a car. Walker is skeptical until he finds his wife's ID bracelet on the cobblestones. He contacts the Paris police and the US embassy, but their responses are bureaucratic and there is little hope anyone will look for her.As Walker carries on the search himself (with input from a very sympathetic but wary desk clerk at the hotel), he stumbles onto a murder scene and then encounters the streetwise young Michelle, who had mistakenly picked up his wife's suitcase at the airport.

Given the question: Generate a question that has the following answer:  Public  for the following movie plot:  The film follows former dolphin trainer and activist Ric O'Barry's quest to document the dolphin hunting operations in Taiji, Wakayama, Japan. In the 1960s, O'Barry helped capture and train the five wild dolphins who shared the role of \\"Flipper\\" in the hit television series of the same name. The show, very popular, fueled widespread public adoration of dolphins, influencing the development of marine parks that included dolphins in their attractions. After one of the dolphins, in O'Barry's opinion, committed a form of suicide in his arms by closing her blowhole voluntarily in order to suffocate, O'Barry came to see the dolphin's captivity and the dolphin capture industry as a curse, not a blessing. Days later, he was arrested off the island of Bimini, attempting to cut a hole in the sea pen in order to set free a captured dolphin.[7] Since then, according to the film, O'Barry has dedicated himself full-time as an advocate on behalf of dolphins around the world. After meeting with O'Barry, Psihoyos and his crew travel to Taiji, Japan, a town that appears to be devoted to dolphins and whales. In a nearby, isolated cove, however, surrounded by wire fences and \\"Keep Out\\" signs, an activity takes place that the townspeople attempt to hide from the public. In the cove, a group of Taiji fishermen engage in dolphin drive hunting. The film states that the dolphin hunt is, in large part, motivated by the tremendous revenue generated for the town by selling some of the captured dolphins, female bottlenose dolphins, to aquariums and marine parks and killing the majority of the rest. The dolphins that are not sold into captivity are then slaughtered in the cove and the meat is sold in supermarkets. According to the evidence presented in the film, the local Japanese government officials are involved in the hiding of the hunting, and the Japanese public is not fully aware of the hunt and the marketing of dolphin meat.

Please answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: The increase in electrons across the periodic table explains why elements go from metals to metalloids and then to nonmetals from left to right across the table. Look at period 2 in Figure below as an example. Lithium (Li) is a metal, boron (B) a metalloid, and fluorine (F) and neon (Ne) are nonmetals. The inner energy level is full for all four elements. This level has just one orbital and can hold a maximum of two electrons. The outer energy level is a different story. This level has four orbitals and can hold a maximum of eight electrons. Lithium has just one electron in this level, boron has three, fluorine has seven, and neon has eight.  I am facing a new situation today: James is memorizing the periodic table and some of the features of the elements on it. He is currently working on the fourth row which starts with Potassium (K) on the far left and ends with Krypton (Kr) to the far right.  Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Given two elements are in the same row of the periodic table, which element will have a higher number of elections, a metal or a nonmetal? Answer:","output":"To answer the question correctly, we will apply the knowledge from the background article to the fourth row of the periodic table. Step 1: Understand the trends in electron count across the periodic table. The background article states that the increase in electrons across the periodic table causes elements to go from metals to metalloids and then to nonmetals from left to right across the table. Step 2: Identify the position of metals and nonmetals in the periodic table. Metals are found on the left side of the periodic table, while nonmetals are on the right side. Step 3: Determine the electron count for metals and nonmetals within the same row. As we move from left to right across a row (period) in the periodic table, the electron count increases. Thus, elements on the left side (metals) will have fewer electrons compared to those on the right side (nonmetals). Step 4: Answer the question using the determined information. Given two elements in the same row of the periodic table, a nonmetal will have a higher number of electrons compared to a metal."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

In the premise, we are given that a group of men are walking down the street while blindfolded.  Step 2: Analyze the information. This information tells us that the men cannot see their surroundings, and it suggests that their destination may be unknown to them. Step 3: Evaluate the hypothesis. The hypothesis states that the men are being led to a secret location.

Question: -  Acid rain makes waters acidic - Causes them to absorb aluminum from soil - The water runs off from the soil into lakes, streams, etc - Fish and their eggs die - Frogs and plants die - Insects and other wildlife die  What might be the last step of the process? Answer:","output":"The last step of the process would most likely involve the disruption of the entire ecosystem and its intricate balance, leading to long-term detrimental effects on biodiversity, habitat loss, and ultimately, a decline in the health of the environment. When acid rain alters the pH level of aquatic habitats, it not only directly affects fish, frogs, plants, insects, and other wildlife but also disrupts the food chain. The death of primary producers such as plants and algae reduces the food supply for herbivorous species that rely on these autotrophs for nourishment. This, in turn, affects the carnivorous species that feed on the herbivores, leading to a cascading effect throughout the food chain. In addition, when an ecosystem loses keystone species, those that play a critical role in maintaining the structure and function of the ecosystem, it results in an imbalance. A loss of these key species can cause a domino effect of decline among other species in the ecosystem, ultimately leading to a reduction in biodiversity. As biodiversity decreases, ecosystems become less resilient against other stressors, such as disease, invasive species, and climate change. Habitat loss is another consequence of the acidification of waters, as the death of plants and other organisms alters the physical structure of aquatic habitats. Vital breeding and spawning grounds for fish and amphibians may be destroyed, further exacerbating the decline of these populations and making it more challenging for them to recover. Additionally, when increased aluminum levels are absorbed by plants in the surrounding area, their growth may be stunted or inhibited altogether, resulting in soil erosion, nutrient depletion, and further habitat loss for other terrestrial species. All of these factors combined culminate in a weakened and vulnerable ecosystem, susceptible to further environmental stressors. These changes can lead to a decline in the overall health of the environment, impacting not only the flora and fauna within the ecosystem but also potentially affecting the ecosystem's services, such as providing clean water, storing carbon, and supporting human livelihoods. Thus, the last step of the process involves the widespread destabilization of ecosystems and the degradation of environmental health, ultimately affecting various species, their interactions, and the overall structure and functioning of ecosystems. To mitigate and reverse these adverse effects, it is essential to address the root causes of acid rain, mainly by implementing policies and technologies that reduce emissions of the pollutants responsible for its formation."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

A landscape can be seen through the window behind St. Catherine. Because of the miniature scale of the painting it can be seen only at close up. The view is built with extremely fine brushwork and shows a number of highly detailed buildings and hills before snowcapped mountains.A lance rests against the shoulder of a youthful-looking St. Michael. Michael is dressed in elaborately jewelled and coloured armour, his left arm holding his helmet, while his right hand rests on the shoulder of the donor as he is presented to Mary. The donor kneels in prayer before the Virgin, with his hands held upwards as if in prayer, although they are not clasped. He wears a gold ring on his right small finger, and is dressed in a long olive-green houppelande, at the time the height of fashion and an indicator of status within the Burgundian court. The gown has a fur-lined high collar and deep baggy sleeves, also lined with fur.  The donor's bowl-shaped haircut, rounded at the fringe but cut above his ears, is also typical of mid-1430s Netherlandish fashion. Except for the red hood, the garment closely resembles that worn by the groom in the Arnolfini Portrait.The capital of the pillar above the donor's head is lined with carvings of military scenes. Similar carvings are seen near the donor in van Eyck's earlier van der Paele and Madonna of Chancellor Rolin, and where they depict events or personal circumstances from the donor's life. Those in the present work likely serve a similar role, however because the donor is unidentified it is unknown as to what they may refer. Elisabeth Dhanens speculates that they might depict the sarcophagus of Hippolytus in Pisa, which she believes adds credibility to the belief the donor was of Italian origin; she also notes the military scene reflects St. Michael's status as military commander.

Article: Going back to school is a very exciting event for my two boys. It means getting new school bags and books, and seeing friends again after the summer holiday. My oldest son, 9-year-old Salem, asked me several times where we would go to buy a backpack, while my other son, 6-year-old Abdullah, asked what school would be like this year. For the last three years, school was a nightmare for many children and their parents as violence increased and there were more attacks on schools and teachers. As a result, many parents prevented their children from going to school. One of six children in this country did not attend primary school in 2009. Many kids who did attend school were accompanied by a parent for the entire day to make sure nothing happened to their children. For poor families or those with large families, back to school can be an expensive time. The government gives some help to those living in poor neighborhoods, and school bags, note books and other items  are given for free. Most of the merchants who sell notebooks and pens now sell their products out on the street instead of in stores. They sit on the ground and lay their items on the ground or they have a small table to sell their goods. The bags cost between 10 and 20, while clothes and shoes cost between 20 and 30. I found all the things I needed for my sons and even bought something for myself. I spent about 50 on each of them, including school uniforms. At the end of the day, we returned to our home carrying many shopping bags filled with items that made my children happy and excited to go back to school.

Larisa Grollemond is conducting a comparative study of illuminations in the Mirror of History (Speculum historiale, Miroir historial) as a graduate intern in the Manuscripts Department of the Getty Museum. The massive text, compiled in the 1200s by friar Vincent of Beauvais and translated into French in the 14th century by Jean de Vignay, attempts to compile all of world history from creation to the present into a single source. “If our twenty-first-century way of understanding everything is to put it on the Internet,” she says, “the medieval way of understanding was to create big encyclopedic texts that try to encompass all of human history and biblical history in an organized way.” Larisa, who recently completed her PhD at the University of Pennsylvania with a focus on 15th-century French manuscript culture, is focusing on the Getty volumes’ unique program of illuminations. The French translation of the Miroir historial exists in some 40 known copies, and while the text remains mostly unchanged from copy to copy, the illuminations vary dramatically, both in how scenes are depicted and in which episodes artists choose to depict. Larisa has decided to focus on the evolution of depictions of India and its inhabitants across these various copies, because the Getty copy, which dates to 1475, contains images that are different from earlier illuminated versions. While other copies don’t dedicate more than one or two illustrations to India, the Getty copy has several that draw upon the medieval tradition of the “monstrous peoples” as well as knowledge of geography, materials, and customs newly gained through trade. This work ties into broader scholarly efforts to shed light on globalization in the Middle Ages. “Scholars of medieval art have generally thought of Western Europe as the center and non-European places as the periphery. There has now been a revision of that view,” says Larisa. “These manuscripts provide an interesting glimpse into how late-medieval Europeans made sense of their world, including... Why did Larisa focus on the evolution of depictions of India?  A. because the text from the French manuscript focuses on India  B. not enough information  C. because the Getty copy has different images of India than earlier versions  D. because it was compiled by Vincent of Beauvais","output":"Larisa focused on the evolution of depictions of India because the Getty copy has different images of India than earlier versions.

Hint: Clouds on Earth are made of water vapor. Venus's clouds are a lot less pleasant. They are made of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide and large amounts of corrosive sulfuric acid! The atmosphere of Venus is so thick that the pressure on the surface of Venus is very high. In fact, it is 90 times greater than the pressure at Earth’s surface! The thick atmosphere causes a strong greenhouse effect. As a result, Venus is the hottest planet. Even though it is farther from the Sun, Venus is much hotter even than Mercury. Temperatures at the surface reach 465°C (860°F). That’s hot enough to melt lead! Answer:","output":"Dan learned less about the planet with a hotter surface temperature. While both students were studying atmospheres and planets, Dan focused on Earth's atmosphere, and Nate studied Venus and its atmosphere. The hint provided states that Venus has a much hotter surface temperature than Earth due to its thick atmosphere, strong greenhouse effect, and a surface temperature reaching 465°C (860°F), which is hot enough to melt lead.

He slowly begins to uncover an enigmatic conspiracy within the city's underbelly while investigating a series of high-profile kidnappings. Unknowingly, Ludlow discovers that his superior officer, Captain Ronald Wander, is the mastermind behind the sinister plot and has been using him as a pawn to execute his diabolic schemes. Act I:  Detective Jack Ludlow is assigned to investigate the abduction of a prominent businessman's daughter, Amy Matherson. Working alongside his close friend, Officer Helen Carter and under the supervision of Captain Wander, Ludlow starts unraveling the web of clues surrounding Amy's case. A series of kidnappings start happening throughout the city, leaving a cryptic symbol behind at each scene that appears to be a calling card from the kidnappers. Captain Wander remains supportive throughout, but Ludlow begins to feel like there is more to the story than meets the eye. Act II:  As Ludlow digs deeper into the evidence, he discovers a pattern that links the abducted people to a multi-billion-dollar deal being negotiated between the government and a private corporation. Initially, Ludlow suspects that the kidnappings are the work of a rival corporation, aiming to sabotage the deal. His investigations lead him to encounter a disgraced former cop turned informant, who drops subtle hints that point Ludlow in the right direction: Captain Wander. In a thrilling twist, Ludlow finally uncovers the hidden motives of Captain Wander. He learns that Wander has been embroiled in a vast conspiracy with a powerful criminal organization intending to gain control of the city's infrastructure and hold the government hostage. Act III: Upon realizing he's been manipulated by Captain Wander, Ludlow feels betrayed and sets out to thwart his plan. While racing against time to save the victims, Ludlow teams up with Officer Carter and the disgraced informant, uncovering the darkest corners of Angelon's criminal underworld. As more members of law enforcement are revealed to be involved in the conspiracy, Ludlow faces a series of escalating obstacles. The climax of the movie involves an intense showdown between Ludlow's team and Captain Wander's forces on a remote island where the remaining kidnap victims are being held. In a high-stakes showdown that tests their loyalty and courage, Ludlow and Wander engage in a physical and psychological battle. In the end, Ludlow manages to save the remaining kidnap victims and exposes the corruption within the police department. Captain Wander is defeated and brought to justice, but not before hinting at the possibility that there might be other conspirators lurking in the shadows. The movie concludes with Ludlow vowing to continue the fight against the criminal underworld and protect his city. This gripping tale of loyalty, betrayal, and justice, set against the city's crime-riddled backdrop, would make for an exhilarating and deeply engaging cinematic experience."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

However, several advocates have recently raised concerns about design flaws in some of the newly-introduced taxi models, with critics arguing that these issues compromise the safety, comfort, and convenience of both passengers and drivers. A Glimpse into the New Taxi Designs Leading the charge in revolutionizing the taxi industry are urban mobility pioneers, with manufacturers touting spacious cabins, ergonomic interiors, and cutting-edge features as main selling points for their latest taxi models. Emphasizing fuel-efficiency, accessibility, and state-of-the-art technology, these new taxis are expected to deliver better user experiences and contribute positively to the environment. Design Flaws: Are Passengers and Drivers at Risk? Despite the exciting prospects of these new-generation taxis, recent reports and accounts from various stakeholders paint a less-than-perfect picture. A growing number of advocates, including disability campaigners, safety experts, and regular users, argue that the new taxis come with significant design flaws, which may affect the overall user experience and compromise safety. 1. Limited Accessibility for Passengers with Disabilities One of the major concerns raised by disability advocates is the limited accessibility options in some new taxi designs. Wheelchair users often struggle to find sufficient room to maneuver, while passengers with mobility aids might face difficulty in entering and alighting the vehicle. For a transportation option that is expected to serve all members of the public, such shortcomings can be seen as a significant barrier to inclusivity. Designers must put a greater emphasis on accessibility when creating taxi designs, ensuring that their vehicles cater to users of all abilities. 2. Uncomfortable Seating Arrangements for Passengers Modern taxi designs are not just criticized for their lack of accessibility, but also for their often-uncomfortable seating arrangements. Passengers report limited legroom, awkward seat angles, and uncomfortable ingress and egress in some of the new taxi models. Such experiences deter passengers from choosing taxis as their preferred mode of transportation, leading to a decline in ridership and revenues for drivers. 3. Compromised Driver Safety  Drivers have also voiced concerns about the new taxi designs, particularly when it comes to visibility and access to controls. Some vehicles feature small rear windows or an obstructive central console, making it difficult for drivers to maintain full situational awareness and increasing the risk of accidents. Additionally, the layout of controls and buttons in certain models could lead to driver distraction, as drivers might struggle to locate and operate essential functions while on the road. Manufacturers' Responses and the Way Forward In response to the criticism from various stakeholders, some manufacturers have taken steps to address the design flaws by engaging in dialogue with concerned parties, such as disability advocacy groups and road safety experts. A few taxi operators have also initiated pilot programs for testing potential design improvements to enhance accessibility, comfort, and safety. To ensure that the new wave of taxis truly caters to the diverse needs of passengers and drivers, all stakeholders in the taxi industry must collaborate and communicate effectively. By working together, they can identify and rectify design flaws, create more inclusive and functional taxi designs, and ultimately, provide a safer and more enjoyable experience for all users. Conclusion As technological advancements continue to disrupt the transportation landscape, the focus must not shift solely towards innovation and efficiency, but rather, it should prioritize the protection and enhancement of the experiences of passengers and drivers alike. By addressing the current design flaws in new-generation taxis, manufacturers and operators, city officials, and other stakeholders can ensure that the taxi industry remains a viable, accessible, and beneficial option for urban mobility in the years to come."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

In a confession published in the Sunday Pictorial newspaper on February 23, 1958, he alleged that he committed the theft with two other accomplices. However, due to discrepancies in his account and no realistic possibility of a conviction, the case was eventually closed. According to Burge, the stolen cup was melted down to make counterfeit half-crown coins, which aligned with known intelligence of the time that involved stolen silver being used for forgery."},{"instruction":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: Ryan Reynold’s “Deadpool 2” is set to take the No. 1 box office crown from “Avengers: Infinity War” this weekend, with 133.5 million from 4,349 North American locations.      The third R-rated superhero film from Fox took in 53.3 million Friday, including a record-setting 18.6 million from Thursday previews, the highest Thursday tally for an R-rated film (“It” had previously held the title with 13.5 million). “Deadpool 2’s” 4,349 theaters also mark Fox’s widest launch ever.      The “Deadpool” sequel will break its own predecessor’s record as the highest opening weekend for an R-rated film — “Deadpool” stunned the industry two years ago with 132.4 million. The original’s unique take on the superhero genre, with Reynolds breaking the fourth wall to address the audience directly, made the film a must-see, and it went on to earn 363 million in North America and 783 worldwide, making it the highest-grossing R-rated movie of all time.      Reynolds returns as the wisecracking mercenary in the 11th title in the X-Men franchise. David Leitch replaced Tim Miller as director, helming from a script by Rhett Reese, Paul Wernick, and Reynolds. The story sees Deadpool forming the X-Force — comprised of Zazie Beetz’s Domino, T.J. Miller’s Weasel, Terry Crews’ Bedlam, Bill Skarsgard’s Zeitgeist, and Rob Delaney’s Peter — to protect a young mutant from Josh Brolin’s Cable.      Related Ryan Reynolds Wants to Explore Deadpool's Bisexuality in Future Films North American Box Office Hits Record 3.33 Billion in Second Quarter      “Infinity War” will drop down to the second place slot in its fourth weekend with 27 million from 4,002 domestic sites, down 472 from last weekend. The Disney-Marvel tentpole has become the fourth-highest grossing film at the worldwide box office with 1.710 billion, topping “Jurassic World’s” 1.671 billion. The film has earned 566.3 million domestically in its first 21 days, along with 1.136 billion internationally.      In third is the debut of Paramount’s “Book Club,” starring Jane Fonda, Candace Bergen, Diane Keaton, and Mary Steenburgen. The film will top early estimates, which had pegged it in the 7 million to 10 million range, with 13 million from 2,781 cinemas. Fonda, Bergen, Keaton, and Steenbergen star as four women who read “Fifty Shades of Grey” in their book club and are inspired to spice up their lives. The film has received mixed reviews and carries a 59% rating on Rotten Tomatoes.      Melissa McCarthy’s Mother’s Day opener “Life of the Party” will reel in around 7 million in its second weekend from 3,656 sites to take the fourth place slot. McCarthy plays a mother who enrolls in the same college as her daughter to earn her degree after divorcing her husband.      “Show Dogs,” from Global Road, will take in 5 million from 3,212 sites for fifth. Directed by Raja Gosnell, the family film follows a rottweiler police dog and his owner going undercover at a prestigious dog show to stop a crime. Will Arnett stars alongside the voice cast of Ludacris, Jordin Sparks, Gabriel Iglesias, Shaquille O’Neal, Stanley Tucci, and Alan Cumming.      POPULAR ON VARIETY: ||||| The sequel doesn't match the opening of the first 'Deadpool' in the U.S., but launches to a record 176 million overseas; the adult-skewing 'Book Club' opens to 12.5 million, while 'Show Dogs' falters.      Superheroes continued to dominate the box office over the weekend as Ryan Reynolds and Fox's Deadpool 2 bowed to 125 million domestically and 301 million globally after scoring the biggest foreign debut ever for an R-rated title.      After falling off more than expected on Saturday, the sequel couldn't match the North American opening of the first Deadpool, which launched to 132.4 million in February 2016, the best showing in history for an R-rated title. Nevertheless, Deadpool 2 still scored the third-best domestic bow of the year to date behind fellow superhero tentpoles Avengers: Infinity War and Black Panther, as well as the No. 2 launch ever for an R-rated film. It is also Fox's second biggest weekend opening in history behind Deadpool.      Overseas, Deadpool 2 rocketed to 176 million from 81 markets, Fox's biggest opening of all time internationally — and that's without China, where the film doesn't yet have a release date. X-Men: Days of Future Past was the previous Fox champ (174 million), while Fox's Logan had been the record holder for biggest foreign bow for an R-rated movie (160 million).      Playing in a total of 4,349 theaters in North America — the widest release in Fox history — Deadpool 2 was frontloaded. It earned a massive 18.6 million in Thursday-evening previews, followed by 53 million on Friday, the top opening day for an R-rated pic. Like Deadpool, the sequel earned an A CinemaScore from audiences. The film skewed male (61 percent), while a pleasing 38 percent of ticket buyers were under the age of 25.      Deadpool 2, directed by David Leitch, follows the irreverent Deadpool (Reynolds) as he forms an X-Force posse in hopes of stopping the evil Cable (Josh Brolin). Morena Baccarin, Julian Dennison, Zazie Beetz, T.J. Miller, Brianna Hildebrand and Jack Kesy co-star. Reynolds produced the sequel and co-wrote the script with his Deadpool collaborators Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick.      \\"The audience's appetite for Merc with the Mouth hasn't waned at all,\\" says Fox domestic distribution chief Chris Aronson. \\"And Ryan Reynolds was tireless in promoting this movie on a global basis.\\"      The foreign opening was up 7 percent when comparing like markets to like markets, while Deadpool 2 came in 5.5 percent behind Deadpool's domestic debut. (The first film bowed over the long Presidents Day/Valentine's Day weekend.) Offshore, the U.K. led with 18 million, followed by South Korea (17 million), Russia (11.8 million), Australia (11.7 million) and Mexico (10.1 million).      Deadpool 2 — which hit theaters as the Fox film empire prepares for the Disney/21st Century Fox merger — easily toppled Disney and Marvel's superhero mashup Infinity War from the top spot. The latter pic was no slouch, however, grossing 28.7 million in its fourth weekend to finish Sunday with a North American total of 595 million and topping the 1.8 billion mark worldwide.      Overseas, Infinity War earned another 84.4 million, fueled by another 53.7 million in China for a foreign total of 1.218 billion and global haul of 1.813 billion, the No. 4 gross of all time. In China, the film cleared the 300 million mark, a feat accomplished by only three other Hollywood titles. Paramount's hit horror film A Quiet Place also made noise in China with an opening of nearly 18 million, bringing that movie's global total to 296.5 million (many think the China debut will end up closer to 19 million).      Thanks in large part to the strength of Deadpool 2 and Infinity War, domestic revenue was up a staggering 64 percent over the same weekend last year, when new openers included Alien: Covenant.      Infinity War came in No. 2 over the weekend, followed by Paramount's adult-skewing, female-fronted Book Club in third place with 12.5 million from 2,781 theaters, slightly ahead of expectations. An estimated 80 percent of ticket buyers were female, while nearly 90 percent of the audience was over 35 — including 60 percent over 50.      Directed by Bill Holderman, Book Club stars Diane Keaton, Jane Fonda, Candice Bergen and Mary Steenburgen as four friends who decide to read Fifty Shades of Grey with unintended consequences. Craig T. Nelson, Andy Garcia and Don Johnson play the love interests.      \\"In a weekend of Deadpool and the Royal Wedding ... we hit the bullseye — we got the underserved audience this movie was made for, and who also don’t tend to come out opening weekend,\\" says a spokesperson for Paramount, which acquired rights to the movie for 10 million.      The third new nationwide offering of the weekend, Show Dogs, couldn't quite find its bark. The family film opened in sixth place with 6 million from 3,145 cinemas.      Rated PG, the Global Road pic chronicles the adventures of a Rottweiler police dog (voiced by Chris \\"Ludacris\\" Bridges) that infiltrates a prestigious dog show with the help of his human partner (Will Arnett). Other castmembers include Natasha Lyonne, Jordin Sparks, Gabriel Iglesias, Shaquille O'Neal and Alan Cumming.      Both Book Club and Show Dogs earned an A- CinemaScore.      Back in the top five, Melissa McCarthy's Life of the Party fell a steep 57 percent in its second weekend to 7.7 million for a domestic total of 31 million, and the Gabrielle Union thriller Breaking In fell even more in its sophomore outing, dipping 63 percent to 6.5 million for a 10-day total of 28.7 million.      New openings at the specialty box office included A24's First Reformed, directed by Paul Schrader. The critically acclaimed film stars Ethan Hawke as a troubled pastor and Amanda Seyfried as a parishioner who comes to him for help.      Opening in four locations, First Reformed posted a solid per-screen average of roughly 25,067 upon grossing 100,270.      Days after its world premiere at the Cannes Film Festival, Focus Features' documentary Pope Francis — A Man of His Word debuted in 346 cinemas in select markets across the U.S., grossing 480,000 for a per-screen average of 1,369.      That wasn't enough to match another doc about a revered public figure — U.S. Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg — as RBG earned 1.3 million from 375 cinemas in its third outing for a domestic total of 3.9 million. Magnolia and Participant Media partnered on the film's release.      A 70mm cut of Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey scored the top location average of any film in a special engagement in four theaters. The special 50th anniversary screening, engineered by Warner Bros. with the help of Christopher Nolan, grossed 200,000 for a per-screen average of 50,000.      While Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's royal wedding on Saturday was a big draw on television, a special viewing in theaters couldn't boast the same. According to early estimates, Fathom's The Royal Wedding grossed roughly 54,000 from 194 theaters for an average of 278.
